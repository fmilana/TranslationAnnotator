Firstly, it omits Fontenelle's descriptive subtitle \"Que la Terre est une planète qui tourne sur elle-même, et autour du Soleil\" (That the Earth is a planet that turns on itself, and around the Sun). This subtitle in the French original immediately establishes the scientific (Copernican) theme of the discussion. Its omission in the English version substantially downplays the work's explicit scientific and educational intent, potentially making its challenging ideas appear less prominent to an English reader in 1688. Secondly, the English text begins with \"A - Tagged Aphra Behn (1688)\", an addition not present in Fontenelle's original. Whether this informational prefix was part of the 1688 printing or is a later annotation, its presence in the provided target text directly frames the work through the lens of its translator and the specific, politically charged year of translation (Declaration of Indulgence controversy, lead-up to Glorious Revolution). This foregrounds the act of English mediation rather than Fontenelle's direct address. These combined changes alter the reader's initial perception and framing of the work."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P002: Nous allâmes donc un Soir aprés Soupé, nous promener dans le Parc. Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description</span></span>, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination</span></span>, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">une resverie aussi douce</span></span> que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">me feroit encore mieux resver</span></span> que la plus belle nuit du monde <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">avec toute sa beauté brune.</span></span> Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet.</span></span> Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je.</span></span> Mais, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences;</span></span> d'où cela vient-il? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné.</span></span> Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">&amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux</span></span>, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"11\">ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe,</span></span> mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"12\">favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"13\">Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée.</span></span> Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle. Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"14\">qui ne fait rire que l'esprit.</span></span> Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison?

Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day? I confess, said she, the Day must yield to such a Night; the day which resembles a fair Beauty, which though more sparkling, is not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night. You are very generous, Madam, said I, to give the advantage to the brown, you who are so admirably fair your self: Yet without dispute, day is the most beautiful thing in Nature; and most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair. But, said she, Beauty is insipid, if it want the pleasure and power of charming; and you must acknowledge that the brightest day that ever you saw could never have engaged you in so agreeable an Ecstasie, as you were just now like to have faln into by the powerful attractions of this Night.</p> <p>P004: I agree to what you say, Madam, said I, but I must own at the same time, that a Beauty of your complexion would give me another sort of transport than the finest Night with all the advantages obscurity can give it.</p> <p>P005: Though that were true, said she, I should not be satisfied; since those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other. How comes it, that Lovers who are the best Judges of what is pleasing and touching, do always address themselves to the Night, in all their Songs and Elegies? I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that? The silence and gloom of the Night, said I, inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing. Besides, the Scene of the Universe by day-light appears too Uniform, we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts. Sir, replied Madam la Marqueise, I have always felt those effects of Night you tell me of, I love the Stars, and could be heartily angry with the Sun for taking them from my sight. Ah, cry'd I, I cannot forgive his taking from me the sight of all those Worlds that are there. Worlds, said she, what Worlds? And looking earnestly upon me, asked me again, what I meant? I ask your Pardon, Madam, said I, I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness. What weakness, said she, more earnestly than before? Alass, said I, I am sorry that I must confess I have imagined to my self, that every Star may perchance be another World, yet I would not swear that it is so; but I will believe it to be true, because that Opinion is so pleasant to me, and gives me very diverting Idea's, which have fixed themselves delightfully in my Imaginations, and 'tis necessary that even solid Truth should have it's agreeableness. Well, said she, since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it; I will believe whatever you please concerning the Stars, if I find it pleasant. Ah, Madam, said I, hastily, it is not such a Pleasure as you find in one of Mullier's Plays; it is a Pleasure that is-I know not where, in our Reason, and which only transports the Mind. What, replied she, do you think me then incapable of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind? I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars. Ah, Madam, cry'd I, I shall never indure to be reproach'd with that neglect of my own happiness, that in a Grove at ten a Clock of the Night, I talk'd of nothing but Philosophy, to the greatest Beauty in the World; no, Madam, search for Philosophy some where else.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description</span></span>, which I cannot well avoid, the fineness of it leading me so necessarily to it. </p><p>P003: The Moon was about an hour high, which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, and checker'd the Paths beneath with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light; there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed: These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation; but the Presence of a Person of her Wit and Beauty hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars.

This removal shifts the tone towards impersonality, subtly altering the narrator-reader dynamic.","The straightforward French is significantly elaborated, introducing complex philosophical concepts ('perfect Idea,' 'ingenious of mankind') not in the original, thus altering the tone and adding uncharacteristic academic weight.","The French 'resverie aussi douce' (a reverie as sweet) is translated as 'so agreeable an Ecstasie.' The word 'Ecstasie' is significantly more intense than 'resverie,' changing the described emotional state from gentle musing to an overwhelming experience.","The simple French 'at the sight of this beautiful night' is expanded to 'by the powerful attractions of this Night.' This addition personifies the night and attributes a strong agency to it, which is an interpretive layer not explicit in the original.","The French 'me feroit encore mieux resver' (would make me reverie/dream even better) is intensified to 'would give me another sort of transport.' This shift from 'resverie' to 'transport' elevates the emotional response, making it seem more profound than the original's lighter tone.","The original poetic comparison 'avec toute sa beauté brune' (with all its brunette beauty) is replaced by the more abstract and analytical 'with all the advantages obscurity can give it,' altering the imagery and tone.","The Marquise's original French expresses a wish ('Je voudrais...fist aussi le mesme effet' - I would wish...produced the same effect). The translation changes this into a declarative statement of fact ('produce not those soft Effects'), fundamentally altering the Marquise's expressed sentiment.","The translation adds the clause 'for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs' as an explicit reason for lovers' gratitude to the night. This interpretative addition is not present in the original French.","The French 'confidences' (confidences, secrets) and 'plaintes' (complaints) are collectively interpreted and narrowed to 'Entrigues' (intrigues) in the English. This addition of 'Entrigues' lends a more specific, potentially scandalous connotation not explicitly present in the original's broader terms.","The original French states that the day *lacks* the ability to inspire sadness and passion. The translation shifts the focus to what the night *does* inspire, adding significant descriptive content ('The silence and gloom of the Night,' 'restless Sigher,' details of day/night settings) absent in Fontenelle's text. This substantially expands and alters the philosopher's explanation.","The French 'on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux' (one is so foolish/mad that one reveries/dreams better from it) is translated and significantly expanded to 'we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing.' Changing 'si fou' to 'vain enough' alters the nuance, and the elaboration on 'resve mieux' with 'extravagant and easing thoughts' makes the description more florid and specific.","The simple French 'a Sun, and a blue vault' is aggrandized to 'one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent.' This adds formality, grandeur, and an emphasis on scale not present in the original, altering the descriptive tone.","The French 'favors reverie, and a certain disorder of thoughts' is translated as 'assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts.' This introduces 'roving Fancies' and 'silent thoughts,' which are specific interpretations that alter the original's more general psychological description.","The playful French 'ma folie' (my folly/madness) is softened to 'my weakness.' The spontaneous 'mon imagination s'est échappée' (my imagination escaped/ran away) becomes 'I was insensibly led to this fond discovery,' suggesting a gradual, sentimental process rather than a sudden burst, thus changing the tone of the philosopher's self-perception.","The French 'qui ne fait rire que l'esprit' (which only makes the mind/intellect laugh), suggesting witty, intellectual amusement, is changed to 'which only transports the Mind.' This implies a more profound, elevating, or ecstatic experience, intensifying the nature of the described intellectual pleasure.","The translation inserts 'with that neglect of my own happiness' when describing the reproach. This addition explicitly frames the philosopher's avoidance of discussing philosophy in terms of personal enjoyment, an interpretative layer not directly present in the original's implied concern for gallantry.","The French 'la plus aimable personne' (the most amiable/lovable person), emphasizing charm and agreeableness, is translated as 'the greatest Beauty in the World.' This shifts the focus to superlative physical appearance and hyperbolizes the compliment, altering its nuance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là</span></span>, il fallut ceder.

More significantly, it adds the interpretative phrase 'from a Novelty she was already but too much prepossest with.' This characterization of the Marquise as overly eager about a 'Novelty' is not present in the source, subtly altering the reader's perception of her from a potentially curious individual to one driven by a perhaps superficial fascination, which could undermine Fontenelle's aim of portraying women as capable of serious scientific engagement.","The French 's'entretenir de bagatelles' (to talk about trifles/trivialities) clearly indicates the narrator's suggestion to discuss light, unimportant matters. The translation 'to pass the time in another manner of Conversation' neutralizes this, removing the specific connotation of 'bagatelles.' This softens the narrator's original suggestion, which carried a slightly dismissive or condescending tone regarding the alternative to a serious philosophical discussion, thereby altering the perceived dynamic and the narrator's attitude.","The translation introduces 'but I pleaded to no Purpose,' an addition not directly found in the French 'A la fin cependant' (In the end however/Nevertheless, in the end), which amplifies the narrator's prior resistance. Furthermore, the French 'voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay' (here is the reasoning into which I threw myself/plunged) conveys a sense of somewhat spontaneous, possibly reluctant, immersion. This is transformed into the more deliberate, controlled, and less impulsive 'I made use of this way of arguing.' These changes subtly manipulate the portrayal of the narrator's transition from resistance to engagement, making him seem more methodically persuasive after a more pronounced struggle, rather than simply yielding and diving into the topic."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">les yeux mauvais</span></span>; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes: &amp; si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir, ce qui reviendrait au même.

Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées</span></span>, &amp; elles le sont si bien qu'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers; car représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyaient le Vol de Phaéton que les Vents enlèvent, qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton. L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">&amp; cent autres rêveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit</span></span>: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra.

The translation not only adds specific mechanical elements (\"Pullies, Wheels and Weights\") not explicit in this immediate phrase but crucially extends concealment from solely visual (\"parfaitement bien cachées\") to include intellectual incomprehensibility (\"hid both from our sight and understanding\"). This alters the nature of the difficulty from a primarily sensory one, as Fontenelle emphasizes with \"les yeux mauvais\", to a broader epistemological challenge.","Translating \"rêveries\" (daydreams, wild fancies, nonsensical ideas) as the much milder \"Notions\" significantly softens Fontenelle's sharp criticism of ancient philosophical explanations. This alters the tone, making Fontenelle sound less dismissive of antiquity than he is in the original, which might manipulate the reader's perception of the author's stance.","The French \"sont venus, qui ont dit\" (came, who said) presents the views of Descartes and other Moderns as a stated, past occurrence, grounding their contribution historically. The translation \"would say\" renders this as hypothetical. This subtly alters the perceived factual and historical basis of the modern mechanical philosophy as Fontenelle presents it, potentially lessening its definitiveness for the reader.","The French \"On veut que\" (One wants that / The idea is that) implies a general tendency or prevailing idea within the new philosophy. The translation \"for some would have\" attributes this mechanistic view of the universe to a more limited group (\"some\"). This shift can subtly diminish the perceived universality or authoritativeness of the mechanistic worldview Fontenelle is describing, possibly reflecting a cautious presentation of transformative ideas in a period of intellectual and religious flux.","The addition of \"just and equal\" to describe the \"disposal of its Parts\" (original: \"l'arrangement des parties\" - the arrangement of the parts) infuses the mechanistic system with qualities of inherent order, fairness, and balance not explicitly present in Fontenelle’s more neutral term. This subtly aligns the new science with notions of a perfectly lawful, perhaps even divinely-underpinned (though mechanical) cosmos, potentially making it more palatable or reflecting contemporary Newtonian influences of an ordered universe.","Translating \"Assez de Gens\" (Enough people / Quite a few people) as \"most People\" exaggerates the number of individuals Fontenelle describes as holding an unenlightened view of nature. This rhetorical inflation makes the 'problem' of unscientific thinking seem more widespread than the original text may imply.","Fontenelle's term \"un faux Merveilleux\" (a false Marvelous/Wonder), referring to a deceptive sense of awe based on ignorance, is rephrased as the more formal and abstract \"some false Principle or other of Admiration.\" This alters the nature of what is being critiqued from a general misguided attitude towards the unknown to a more structured (though false) intellectual tenet, subtly changing the reader's understanding of the object of Fontenelle's criticism.","The verb \"respectent\" (they respect), describing the attitude of some towards an obscurantist view of nature, is significantly intensified to \"they adore.\" This change portrays their adherence to this \"false Marvelous\" as more extreme, irrational, or even quasi-religious, thereby sharpening the contrast with the rational, understandable universe championed by Fontenelle and the Enlightenment.","Translating \"une espece de Magie\" (a kind of Magic) as \"a kind of Miracle\" shifts the term towards one with stronger and more specific religious connotations. In the English socio-religious context of the late 17th century, marked by tensions between Protestantism, fears of Catholicism (reign of James II), and the rise of rationalism, using \"Miracle\" could subtly steer the reader to associate the critiqued ignorance more directly with religious superstition (i.e., belief in divine interventions) rather than general pre-scientific beliefs about occult forces. This manipulates perception by framing the issue in terms more resonant with contemporary religious debates."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">comme des cloux</span></span>.

This subtly alters the imagery, making the stars seem more ornate or divinely touched, rather than Fontenelle's simpler, more direct simile. This shifts the perception from a practical attachment ('nails') to a more decorative or valuable one ('Golden Nails'), potentially appealing to a sense of grandeur rather than Fontenelle's popularizing, demystifying tone.","The French 'dernière voûte des Cieux' means the 'last' or 'outermost vault of the Heavens,' referring to the most distant part of the sky. Translating 'dernière' (last/final/ultimate) as 'lowest' in the phrase 'lowest Heaven' introduces a significant alteration in meaning. 'Lowest' implies a different position in a cosmological hierarchy, potentially misrepresenting the celestial structure Fontenelle is explaining or subtly aligning it with specific theological interpretations of multiple 'heavens,' which could be confusing in the context of popularizing Copernican astronomy.","The original French states that the first observations 'ont été le fondement de l'Astronomie' (were the foundation of Astronomy). The English translation adds the clause 'which have since been so well improved'. This addition is not in the source and subtly shifts the reader's perception by diminishing the direct, foundational importance of these early observations, instead emphasizing subsequent progress and improvement. This editorial insertion reflects a particular view on scientific progress not explicitly stated by Fontenelle.","The original French 'fille de l'Interêt' (daughter of Interest) is translated as 'Child of Interest.' While 'child' is related, changing 'daughter' to 'child' neutralizes the specific feminine personification used by Fontenelle for Astronomy ('fille de l'Oisiveté' - Daughter of Idleness) and Poetry ('fille de l'Amour' - daughter of Love in the source). This alteration breaks the consistent parallelism of Fontenelle's literary device and subtly changes the nature of the personification for Geometry.","The original French 'qu'elle est fille de l'Amour' (that she is daughter of Love) continues Fontenelle's consistent personification for the origins of disciplines. The translation 'that it owes its beginning to Love' completely removes this 'daughter' metaphor, replacing it with a more abstract causal statement. This significantly alters the literary style, diminishing the charm and the consistent allegorical framing ('fille de...') that Fontenelle used, thereby manipulating the reader's experience of the text's literary qualities aimed at making science approachable and engaging."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie.

Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">trop libertine</span></span>, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">bien mal intentionné pour la Terre</span></span>? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers</span></span>, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate</span></span> &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation. Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">si humiliant</span></span>. Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire. Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là</span></span>, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy. </p><p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il? Avez-vous remarqué, lui répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? Elle va vers le but où elle est envoyée, &amp; en même temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-même, en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut. La Terre fait la même chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures. Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le côté où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">il semble qu'il s'abaisse</span></span>. Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la même cause. Les Planètes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nôtre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planètes marchent aussi; cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard, &amp; nous fait paroître dans leur cours des bizarreries dont il n'est pas nécessaire que je vous parle. Il suffit que vous sachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irrégulier dans les Planètes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont notre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fond elles sont toutes très-reglées. Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">on ne l'a guere ménagée</span></span>, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité.. Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures. </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">un gros Navire monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes</span></span>, &amp; d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises? Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes. Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fût cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matière céleste, &amp; ne pas s'y laisser emporter? C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</p> <p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men</span></span>, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">a more Amorous Inclination</span></span>; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature.</span></span> Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">impious</span></span>, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties. </p><p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">he had no great kindness for the Earth.</span></span> I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe</span></span>; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion</span></span>, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">so easie, and so humble.</span></span> Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps</span></span>, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">we believe sheis setting</span></span>. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns</span></span>, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men</span></span>, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing?

It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","explanations":["The French \"une [âme] plus tendre\" (a more tender [soul]) is translated so that \"plus tendre\" becomes \"a more Amorous Inclination.\" \"Amorous\" significantly narrows the meaning of \"tendre,\" which implies general gentleness and sensitivity, to a specific focus on romantic or sexual love. This alters the connotation and subtly changes the perceived requirements of poetry.","The French implies that the characters of \"L'Astrée\" do not spend their time on astronomy, leaving the nature of their actual pursuits unstated. The translation adds the specific description \"they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature.\" This addition shapes the reader's perception of pastoral life as depicted in \"L'Astrée,\" embellishing it with a sentimental quality not explicitly present in Fontenelle's text at this point.","The French \"trop libertine\" (too freethinking/skeptical) is translated as \"impious.\" In the 17th-century French context, \"libertin\" often referred to intellectual freethinking and skepticism towards religious dogma. \"Impious\" is a much harsher term, directly signifying irreverence towards God. This translation intensifies the condemnation of the King's thought, potentially to align with English religious sensitivities of the era, thereby altering the tone and the perceived severity of the statement.","The Marquise's strong French accusation that Copernicus was \"bien mal intentionné pour la Terre\" (very ill-intentioned towards the Earth) is significantly softened to \"he had no great kindness for the Earth.\" This understatement downplays the perceived hostility of Copernicus, altering the tone of the Marquise's remark and potentially making Copernicus's revolutionary ideas seem less antagonistic.","The French \"s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers\" (had put themselves in the most beautiful place) suggests self-placement or assumption. The translation \"had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe\" uses \"usurp'd,\" a far stronger term implying an illegitimate and forceful seizure of that position. This intensifies the criticism of human vanity, and the word \"usurp'd\" might have carried particular resonance in the English socio-political context of the 1680s concerning legitimate authority.","The French \"Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy\" (He is very pleased that everything is made for him) and \"il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate\" (he supposes, perhaps without noticing it, this principle that flatters him) is altered. \"Bien aise\" (very pleased) becomes \"proud to fansie,\" introducing negative connotations of pride and unreality. More significantly, the passive construction where a \"principle flatters him\" (le flate), possibly unconsciously, is changed to an active one where the philosopher \"without reflexion, flatters his Senses.\" This shifts agency, making the philosopher seem more consciously self-deceiving and motivated by sensory gratification rather than unconscious bias, thus altering the psychological portrayal.","The French \"si humiliant\" (so humiliating), referring to Copernicus's system, is translated as \"so easie, and so humble.\" This is a complete inversion of meaning. \"Humiliant\" implies a blow to human pride, while \"easie, and so humble\" suggests accessibility and modesty. This radical alteration significantly changes the Marquise's objection and could be intended to make the Copernican system appear less threatening or more acceptable to readers.","The French \"il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là\" conveys that it's not her role or fitting for her to make such (mathematical) marks. The translation \"it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps\" narrows this to a matter of \"decency,\" imposing a specific moral or social propriety. This shifts the rationale for the Marquise's reluctance, framing it through the lens of contemporary English notions of female decorum rather than the broader French sense of what is appropriate to her station or persona.","The French refers to the Sun (\"le Soleil,\" masculine implicitly governing the pronoun \"il\") in \"il semble qu'il s'abaisse\" (it seems that it sets). The English translation states \"we believe sheis setting,\" personifying the Sun as \"she.\" This is an unusual gender attribution for the Sun in English (typically \"he\" or \"it\"). This change in personification subtly alters the connotation, potentially feminizing a powerful celestial body in a work aimed at a female audience, or it could be an error that nonetheless changes the reader's perception.","The French Marquise's comment \"on ne l'a guere ménagée\" (one/they have hardly spared/treated gently the Earth) uses an impersonal pronoun \"on.\" The translation changes this to a direct and personal criticism: \"I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns.\" This shifts the perceived object of the Marquise's complaint from a general state of affairs or the workings of the system itself to a specific failing of Copernicus, thereby personalizing the blame.","The French description of a large ship includes \"un gros Navire monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes\" (a large ship equipped with 150 cannons, carrying more than 3000 men). The English translation reduces these figures to \"a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men.\" This downsizing of the ship's armament and crew alters the factual details of the analogy, potentially lessening its impact or the perceived scale of the marvel of its portability."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P011: Mais, répliqua-t-elle encore, comment la Terre avec tout son poids se soûtient- elle sur votre matiere celeste qui doit être bien legere, puisqu'elle est si fluide?

Yet 'tis lighter than the Water, because it swims upon it. As long as you command your First-Rate Frigat, said she, angrily, I will not argue with you; but can you assure me, that I am in no danger, by inhabiting such a little Humming-Top, as you have made the World to be? Well, Madam, said I, the Earth shall be supported by four Elephants, as the Indians fansie it is. Here's a new System indeed, cry'd Madam la Marquiese; yet I love those Men, for providing for their own security, by resting upon a solid Foundation; whereas we that follow Copernicus, are so inconsiderate, as to swim at a venture upon your Celestial Matter: And I dare say, if these Indians thought the Earth in any danger of falling, they wou'd quickly double the number of their Elephants.

These changes introduce naval specificity and an ungrounded reference, subtly altering the original general analogy.","The French \"tant que vous aurez le gros Vaisseau\" (as long as you have/use the large ship [as an example]) is translated as \"As long as you command your First-Rate Frigat,\". This introduces \"First-Rate Frigat,\" a specific warship type, and the verb \"command,\" implying authority and a more assertive, perhaps martial, context not explicit in the original's more general phrasing.","The neutral French \"comme font les Indiens\" (as the Indians do/as is their custom) is rendered as \"as the Indians fansie it is.\" The addition of \"fansie\" (fancy/imagine) introduces a dismissive or condescending tone towards the Indian belief, framing it as mere imagination rather than a cultural practice or cosmological view.","The French \"en peril de se mouvoir\" (in danger of moving) refers to the anxiety caused by the Copernican idea of Earth's motion. Translating this as \"in any danger of falling\" simplifies the anxiety to a more primitive fear of physical collapse, subtly altering the specific intellectual concern being discussed.","The French \"dormir en assurance\" (to sleep in security/assurance) is expanded to \"sleep in quiet, without fear of falling.\" The addition \"without fear of falling\" is not in the original and reinforces the previous shift from \"moving\" to \"falling,\" specifying the nature of the fear and subtly shaping the reader's understanding of the characters' anxieties.","The French \"des têtes cheveluës\" (hairy heads, or heads with abundant hair) is grossly mistranslated as \"Hands cover'd with Wool.\" This error completely changes the description, introducing a bizarre, animalistic, or primitive image for some of the diverse peoples, thereby manipulating the reader's perception.","The original \"de grands Païs qui n'ont que des Cabanes\" (large countries/lands that only have huts) is elaborated into \"spacious Fields, without Towns, only Tents and Huts.\" The additions of \"spacious Fields, without Towns\" and \"Tents\" create a more specific and potentially stereotypical image of primitive or nomadic societies, altering the simpler original description.","The French \"toute cette variété infinie\" (all this infinite variety) is translated as \"all the Variety.\" The omission of the crucial adjective \"infinie\" (infinite) significantly diminishes the scale, wonder, and philosophical depth of Fontenelle's vision, especially in an era grappling with concepts of infinity in the cosmos.","The French \"d'autres Peuples\" (other Peoples) is translated as \"several other Nations.\" \"Peuples\" is a general term for populations or groups of people, while \"Nations\" implies more politically organized or distinct ethnic/cultural entities. This shift to \"Nations\" imposes a more specific, potentially Eurocentric, framework onto the diverse groups being imagined."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.

While 'less Pleasure' can be seen as a component of 'moins de gayeté,' the addition of 'more Gravity' is an interpretive element not explicitly present in the original French. This subtly manipulates the characterization of the English by portraying them not merely as less cheerful but as distinctively more solemn, which can reinforce or introduce a specific stereotype.","The French text refers to a specific Indigenous group, `des Iroquois`. The English translation replaces this with `the Canibals`, a generic and highly pejorative term. This substitution sensationalizes the description, erases the specific cultural identity of the Iroquois, and imposes a broadly negative and dehumanizing label, thereby manipulating the reader's perception by framing the group through a lens of generalized savagery rather than as a particular people.","The original French `de petits Tartares` (little Tartars) is a somewhat general designation. The English translation adds specificity by rendering it as `the Crim, or Little Tartars`, explicitly identifying them as Crimean Tartars. This addition of information, not present in the source text, manipulates the reader's understanding by narrowing the reference to a specific historical group known for slave raiding, potentially loading the statement with more pointed historical or political connotations than the original's broader term might have carried.","The French phrase `debiterons peut-être encore des rêveries.` (we will perhaps again utter/deal in fancies/daydreams.) suggests imaginative, speculative, or even whimsical content for their conversation. The English translation `perhaps talking as we do now.` neutralizes this rich connotation, reducing their activity to a simple description of ongoing conversation.

This alters the Marquise's tone from one of gentle amusement or mild pleasure to strong captivation, subtly changing her character's mode of expression and making her reaction more emphatic.","The French \"un usage qui mr paroit assez particulier\" (a custom that seems quite/fairly particular to me) is translated as \"one so peculiar a Custom.\" The addition of \"so\" intensifies the degree of peculiarity attributed to the custom by the Marquise, making her observation sound more definitive and the custom more markedly strange than the original's more moderate phrasing.","The concise French \"leurs Maris trovent dans leurs faveurs un superflu qu'ils abandonnent aux Etrangers\" (their husbands find in their [wives'] favors a surplus which they give up to strangers) is significantly embellished. The translation adds phrases like \"so many Charms in their Embraces,\" \"as more than satisfie them,\" the adverb \"freely,\" and the adjective \"fair\" (for wives). This expansion adds vividness and explicitness not present in the original, potentially sensationalizing the custom by emphasizing the wives' allure and the husbands' willing complicity, thus shifting the reader's perception of the scenario.","The French \"ces Païs icy\" (these countries here/countries like ours, implying a general European context) and \"le Maris\" (husbands in general) are translated as \"our Country\" and \"our Husbands.\" This subtly domesticates the Marquise's comment, making it a specific reflection on the women and husbands of the translator's country (likely England), rather than a broader European observation. This narrows the scope of the original social commentary and directs it more pointedly towards the translator's immediate audience.","The French \"on prend davantage\" (one takes more/people take more) uses an active voice with an indefinite pronoun \"on,\" which in this risqué context strongly implies that women actively take more (lovers) because their husbands \"ne relâchent rien\" (yield nothing). The English translation \"that the more is taken from 'em\" (referring to the husbands) shifts to a passive construction. This change alters the focus from women's agency in seeking satisfaction to the husbands being the ones from whom something (e.g., fidelity, or their wives by others) is taken. This subtly manipulates the reader's understanding of the social dynamic and the implied cause-and-effect.","The French \"Taisez-vous\" is a direct and abrupt command for the philosopher to be silent. The Marquise then states \"je ne veux plus dire de folies\" (I don't want to say any more foolish things/nonsense *myself*). The translation \"No more of these Fooleries\" has the Marquise first characterizing the philosopher's (or their shared) preceding witty remarks as \"Fooleries.\" This is an interpretation not explicitly in \"Taisez-vous.\" It shifts the tone, making her interruption sound more critical and dismissive of the immediately preceding banter, rather than simply cutting it short to change the subject and avoid her *own* potential \"folies.\"","The French text explicitly concludes the analogy by stating \"& toute la Coque de Ver à soye tourne en même temps\" (and the whole silkworm cocoon turns at the same time), thereby reinforcing the parallel between the Earth's atmosphere and the silkworm's cocoon both turning. The English translation omits this direct statement about the cocoon's movement, focusing only on \"the Air that is carried round at the same time with it [the Earth].\" This omission of information subtly weakens the explicit parallel structure of Fontenelle's analogy, altering the rhetorical completeness of the comparison by not restating the corresponding movement of the cocoon as described in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P016: Vous me présentez la Terre sous des idées bien méprisables, dit la Marquise.

It seems to me, said she, that 'tis very ridiculous to inhabit any thing that turns so often, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">is so much agitated</span></span>; and the worst of all is, that we are not assur'd whether we turn round, or not; for, to be plain with you, and that I may keep none of my Doubts from you, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">I do extreamly suspect, that all the Pre-cautions you can take, will not convince me of the Motion of the Earth:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">For is it possible, but Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us some sensible Sign, by which we might discover the turning round of so vast a Body?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">The Motions (answer'd I) which are most natural to remove, are the least perceptible</span></span>; and which holds true, even in Morality; for the Motion of Self-love is so natural to us, that for the most part we do not feel it, while we believe we act by other Principles. Ah, said she, do you begin to speak of Moral Philosophy, when the Question is of that which is altogether natural? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">But I perceive you are sleepy, and begin to yawn;</span></span> let us therefore retire, for there's enough said for the first Night, to morrow we shall return hither again; you with your Systems, and I with my Ignorance. In returning to the Castle, to make an end of what might be said to Systems, I told her, there was a third Opinion invented by Ticho-brahe, who wou'd have the Earth absolutely immoveable, and plac'd in the Centre of the Universe, and made the Sun to turn round it, as he did the other Planets to turn round the Sun; because, since the new Discoveries, it cou'd not be imagin'd that the other Planets turn'd round the Earth. But my Lady Marquiese, whose Judgment and Understanding is solid and penetrating, found, there was too much Affectation in endeavouring to free the Earth from turning round the Sun, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">since several other great Bodies cou'd not be exempt from that Labour</span></span>; and that the Sun was not so proper and fit to turn round the Earth, since the other Planets turn round the Sun; and that this new System was only good to maintain the standing still of the Earth, if one had a mind to undertake that Argument; but 'tis not proper to perswade another to believe it. At last, we resolv'd to hold our selves to the Opinion of Copernicus, which is more uniform, and more agreeable, without the least mixture of Prejudice; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">and, indeed, its Simplicity and Easiness perswades as much as its Boldness pleases.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The original French \"n'entre point en connaissance de\" (does not take notice of/is not aware of) depicts a detached Nature. The translation \"is not at the pains to consider\" implies Nature makes a conscious choice to disregard human affairs, suggesting a different, more willful character for Nature. Furthermore, \"petits mouvements particuliers\" (small particular movements) is translated as the more dramatic \"Troubles and Commotions,\" which intensifies the perception of human activities and Nature's dismissal of them, thus manipulating the reader's understanding of Nature's role and human affairs.","The original \"se tourmenter tant\" (to torment oneself so much) refers to humans tormenting themselves. The translation \"is so much agitated,\" in context (\"to inhabit any thing that turns so often, and is so much agitated\"), shifts the quality of being \"agitated\" to the Earth (\"any thing that turns\"), rather than the humans upon it. This alters the Marquise’s commentary on human nature by removing the self-inflicted aspect of their turmoil.","The Marquise originally states that the philosopher's \"precautions\" (explanations designed \"pour empêcher qu'on ne s'aperçoive\" – to prevent one from noticing the Earth's movement) are themselves \"suspectes\" (suspicious), implying they might be intentionally obscuring or flawed. The translation shifts her suspicion to whether these precautions \"will not convince me,\" focusing on their persuasive power on her rather than on the potentially deceptive nature or intent of the explanations themselves, thereby subtly altering the basis of her skepticism.","The original French poses an impersonal question about whether the Earth's movement (\"il\") would inherently leave a perceptible sign. The translation significantly alters this by introducing \"Nature\" as a conscious, intentional agent (\"Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us\"). This reframes the query from one about physics and observation to one about teleological design or provision by a personified Nature, subtly manipulating the reader's understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of the Marquise's doubt.","The original \"Les mouvements les plus naturels ... & les plus ordinaires\" means \"The most natural and most ordinary movements.\" The translation's insertion of \"to remove\" creates the phrase \"most natural to remove,\" which is absent from the original and drastically alters the philosopher's intended meaning. Instead of referring to inherent or common movements, it suggests movements that are natural to eliminate or easy to get rid of, thereby distorting the analogy used to explain why Earth's motion isn't felt.","The Marquise's original comment, \"cela s'appelle bâiller\" (literally, \"that is called yawning\"), is a witty, metaphorical critique indicating that the philosopher's digression into morality during a physics discussion is boring. The translation changes this into a literal observation directed at the philosopher: \"But I perceive you are sleepy, and begin to yawn.\" This shift diminishes the Marquise's wit, recasts her interjection as a personal remark about the philosopher’s state rather than a general commentary on his discourse, and thus alters the reader's perception of her character and the dynamic of the conversation.","The original text discusses exempting celestial bodies from the act of turning (\"exempter de tourner\"). The translation specifies that they could not be exempt \"from that Labour.\" The addition of \"that Labour\" personifies planetary motion, imbuing it with a sense of toil or effort. This is not present in Fontenelle’s more neutral description and subtly manipulates the reader by adding a negative or burdensome connotation to the natural movements of planets.","The original attributes the persuasive power of Copernicus's system to \"la simplicité\" (its simplicity). The translation expands this to \"its Simplicity and Easiness.\" The addition of \"Easiness\" as a distinct quality is not in the source text. This subtly manipulates the reader by enhancing the appeal of the Copernican system, suggesting an additional virtue (ease of understanding or application) beyond what Fontenelle explicitly stated, potentially making the system appear more compelling."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">SECOND SOIR.

By doing so, the translation fails to immediately convey the boldness and specificity of Fontenelle's argument to the reader, potentially softening the impact of this then-revolutionary idea and altering the way the chapter is introduced compared to the original text, which aimed to popularize such concepts."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P021: Le lendemain au matin dès que l'on pût entrer dans l'Appartement de la Marquise, j'envoyai savoir de ses nouvelles, &amp; lui demander si elle avoit pû dormir en tournant.

All these Arguments wou'd not prevail upon my Citizen; who wou'd continue still obstinate in maintaining, that St. Denis was not inhabited, because he saw none of the People. The Moon is our St. Denis, and we the Citizens of Paris, that never went out of our own Town. Ah, interrupted the Marquiese, you do us wrong; we are not so foolish as your Citizens of Paris: Since he sees that St. Denis is so like to Paris in every thing, he must have lost his Reason, if he did not think it was inhabited: But for the Moon, that's nothing like the Earth.

'Nauseous' is a significantly stronger and more negative adjective, altering the tone by expressing a much deeper disgust for the custom than the original's milder annoyance.","The original 'Encore leur fut-on bien obligé' (Still, one was much obliged to them) which conveys a formal, possibly ironic, politeness, is replaced by 'and yet we thought our selves happy that we were so easily rid of 'em then'. This translation changes the narrator's expressed sentiment from one of (perhaps feigned) gratitude to undisguised relief, altering the social nuance and making the narrator seem more overtly impolite.","The French 'dédaigna' (disdained/scorned) implies the Marquise felt it beneath her to discuss the topic again. The translation 'wou'd not be at the pains' (would not bother/take the trouble) lessens this, suggesting a mere unwillingness to exert effort rather than intellectual disdain, subtly weakening the portrayal of her character's intellectual confidence or impatience.","The Marquise's dismissal of the idea of an inhabited Moon as 'une folie & d'une vision' (madness and a vision/hallucination) is translated as 'a Fable'. This significantly softens her initial reaction, changing it from a strong rejection based on perceived irrationality to a milder dismissal of it as a mere untrue story, thereby altering the reader's perception of her skepticism.","The translation omits the final clause '& qu'on a des ménagemens avec ses Ennemis mêmes' (and that one has dealings/comes to arrangements even with one's Enemies). This omission removes a key aspect of the narrator's analogy about intellectual caution, specifically the idea of maintaining practical relations even with outright opponents, thereby making his stated diplomatic approach seem less comprehensive.","The French 'je me tiens toujours en état de me pouvoir ranger à leur opinion avec honneur, si elle avoit le dessus' (I always keep myself in a position to align with their opinion with honor, if it gained the upper hand) is translated as 'I carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, upon occasion, with Honour go over to their side who have the better'. The word 'trimmingly' introduces a politically charged term from 17th-century England, often implying opportunism. This choice can subtly manipulate the reader's perception of the narrator's integrity, suggesting a shift based on expediency rather than purely intellectual conviction, especially in the English socio-political context of the time.","The French 'mais en attendant qu'ils ayent sur nous quelque avantage considérable' (but while waiting until they have some considerable advantage over us) describes a future contingency. The translation 'but still they gain some considerable Advantage over us' incorrectly changes this to an ongoing present reality (they are currently gaining). This manipulates the reader's understanding of the narrator's stance, making his side appear to be already losing ground.","The original 'en vertu d'une nature particulière qu'il a' (by virtue of a particular/specific nature that it has) is translated as 'by virtue of his particular Essence'. In the 17th-century, 'Essence' carried stronger metaphysical and philosophical connotations than 'nature particulière'. This shift can subtly elevate the description of the sun, making it sound more aligned with formal scholastic philosophy than the popular science style of Fontenelle, potentially manipulating the reader's perception of the philosophical depth being invoked.","The French 'il faut que la Terre renvoye aussi' (it must be that the Earth also reflects back / the Earth must also reflect back) expresses a logical deduction or necessity. The translation 'as the Earth, without doubt, reflects it back again' changes this to a more emphatic assertion of unquestionable fact. This subtly shifts the tone from reasoned explanation to a more forceful, less nuanced statement, potentially altering the perceived certainty of the claim."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere du Soleil?

Je ne vous conseille pas d'entreprendre d'y rien réformer, répondis-je, il vaut mieux que vous acheviez de vous convaincre de l'entiere ressemblance de la Terre &amp; de la Lune. Représentez-vous ces deux grandes Boules suspendües dans les Cieux. Vous savez que le Soleil éclaire toûjours une moitié des Corps qui sont ronds, &amp; que l'autre moitié est dans l'ombre. Il y a donc toûjours une moitié, tant de la Terre que de la Lune, qui est éclairée du Soleil, c'est à dire, qui a le jour, &amp; une autre moitié qui est dans la nuit. Remarquez d'ailleurs que comme une Balle a moins de force &amp; de vitesse après qu'elle a été donner contre une muraille qui l'a renvoyée d'un autre côté, de même la lumière s'affoiblit lors qu'elle a été réfléchie par quelque Corps. Cette lumière blanchâtre qui nous vient de la Lune, est la lumière même du Soleil, mais elle ne peut venir de la Lune à nous que par une réflexion. Elle a donc beaucoup perdu de la force &amp; de la vivacité qu'elle avoit lorsqu'elle étoit receüe directement sur la Lune, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">&amp; cette lumière éclatante que nous recevons du Soleil &amp; que la Terre reflechit sur la Lune, ne doit plus être qu'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée.</span></span> Ainsi ce qui nous paroit lumineux dans la Lune, &amp; qui nous éclaire pendant nos nuits, ce sont des parties de la Lune qui ont le jour; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; les parties de la Terre qui ont le jour lors qu'elles sont tournées vers les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit les éclairent aussi.</span></span> Tout dépend de la manière dont la Lune &amp; la Terre se regardent. Dans les premiers jours du mois que l'on ne voit pas la Lune, c'est qu'elle est entre le Soleil &amp; nous, &amp; qu'elle marche de jour avec le Soleil. Il faut necessairement que toute sa moitié qui a le jour, soit tournée vers le Soleil, &amp; que toute sa moitié qui a la nuit, soit tournée vers nous. Nous n'avons garde de voir cette moitié qui n'a aucune lumière pour se faire voir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">Mais cette moitié de la Lune qui a la nuit, étant tournée vers la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, nous voit sans être veüe</span></span>, &amp; nous voit sous la même figure que nous voyons la Pleine Lune. C'est alors pour les Gens de la Lune Pleine Terre, s'il est permis de parler ainsi. Ensuite la Lune qui avance sur son Cercle d'un mois, se dégage de dessous le Soleil, &amp; commence à tourner vers nous un petit coin de sa moitié éclairée, &amp; voilà le Croissant. Alors aussi les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit commencent à ne plus voir toute la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, &amp; nous sommes en Décours pour elles.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P019: But, said the Marquiese, is the Earth as proper for reflecting the Light of the Sun, as the Moon?

Fontenelle's original text uses simpler descriptions ('solide,' 'ouvertures en ligne droite'). This addition makes the philosopher's explanation sound more formally scholastic, subtly altering the accessible tone Fontenelle aimed for in his popularization of science.","The French 'elles se ressemblent toutes extrêmement' (they all resemble each other extremely), referring to social conditions, is strengthened to 'there's no difference between them and us.' This changes a statement of strong similarity into one of absolute identity, giving the Marquise's social analogy a more radical implication than the original.","The translation changes 'mauvais point de veüe' (bad/wrong point of view) to 'false Light.' While related, 'false Light' carries stronger connotations of deception or inherent misrepresentation, rather than simply an ill-chosen perspective, thus subtly altering the philosophical nuance of human fallibility.","The original French refers to a 'preoccupation... pour la Lune' (for the Moon). The translation shifts this preoccupation to be 'for the Inhabitants of the Moon.' This alters the object of the Marquise's statement, focusing on hypothetical beings rather than the celestial body itself, subtly changing the emphasis.","The English translation replaces Fontenelle's more evocative description of the Moon's 'tremblement' (libration) and perceived 'pendulum movement' with a lengthy, technical explanation of synchronous rotation. This inserted didactic material, not present in the corresponding French, alters the original's flow and makes the philosopher's discourse more like a detailed astronomical lecture.","The French 'Toutes ces Planètes... sont faites comme nous, qui rejetons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mêmes' (All these planets... are made like us, who always project onto others what is in ourselves) is translated to 'All these Planets... are like us Mortals, who always cast our own Faults upon others'. The addition of 'Mortals' is a minor emphasis, but changing 'ce qui est en nous-mêmes' (that which is in ourselves) to 'our own Faults' narrows a general psychological observation to a specifically moralistic one, altering the tone and meaning of the Marquise's analogy.","The French text specifies that sunlight reflected from the Earth to the Moon 'ne doit plus être qu'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée' (must no longer be anything but a whitish light when it has arrived there). The English translation omits this specific detail about the light becoming 'whitish' again, stating more generally that it would 'in the same manner appear' pale. This omission removes a precise parallel drawn by Fontenelle, weakening the description.","The French states that the lit parts of the Earth enlighten 'les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit' (the parts of the Moon that are in night). The translation changes this to say the Earth 'does give Light to the Inhabitants there.' This shifts the focus from the celestial body to its hypothetical inhabitants, subtly altering the subject of Fontenelle's explanation.","The French says 'la moitié de la Lune... nous voit sans être veüe' (the half of the Moon... sees us without being seen). The English translation changes the agent of perception from the Moon itself to 'the Inhabitants see us.' This consistently redirects attention from celestial mechanics to the experience of posited inhabitants, modifying the original emphasis."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je saurai tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.

The translation 'which was seen by the Inhabitants of the obscure half of the Moon:' adds the specific agents 'the Inhabitants,' who are not explicitly mentioned in this phrase in the source. This addition subtly shifts perception by populating the Moon during a technical astronomical explanation.","The original phrase 'pour la Lune' translates to 'for the Moon,' which can refer to the celestial body itself. The English translation 'to those in the Moon' explicitly attributes the experience of the eclipse to hypothetical inhabitants. This addition of specificity manipulates the reader's understanding by consistently focusing on sentient beings where the original is more ambiguous or general.","Similar to the previous instance, the French 'pour la Lune' ('for the Moon') is translated as 'to them,' directly referring to inhabitants.

This pluralization and the addition of the softer term \"Spirits\" alter the original conception of a single demonic entity, potentially lessening its perceived threat or specificity and subtly shifting the reader's understanding of the belief described.","The French \"une situation tres propre à obtenir\" (a situation very suitable/appropriate for obtaining) is rendered as \"most devout posture for obtaining\". The introduction of the word \"devout\" attributes a specific religious quality to the Indians' actions that is not explicitly present in Fontenelle's original description, subtly framing their superstition as a form of (misguided) piety.","The French \"des Magiciennes\" (female magicians/sorceresses, plural) is translated as \"the Magician\" (singular, and in the English of the time, often defaulting to male). This changes the agency from multiple female figures to a single, implicitly male, figure, thereby altering the imagery and removing the gendered aspect of the original.","The specific parallel Fontenelle draws with \"les Indiens de ce pays-là\" (the Indians of that country [the Moon]) behaving \"comme les nôtres\" (like ours) is lost. The translation \"some of 'em\" makes the comparison generic, diluting the satirical force of imagining lunar inhabitants mirroring specific earthly superstitions and groups.","While \"que nous allassions gâter leurs Herbes\" is translated (as \"that we are coming to spoil their Grass\"), the subsequent and concluding clause of the Marquise's thought, \"& qu'enfin nous leur rendissions la consternation qu'ils causent icy-bas\" (meaning \"and that finally we would cause them the consternation that they [the Moon] cause down here\"), is omitted from the target text. This omission truncates the Marquise's idea about the reciprocity of fear and superstitious beliefs, altering the reader's perception of her complete thought.","The translation conveys the idea of Lunarians adoring Earth from the first part of the French segment. However, Fontenelle's vivid concluding phrase \"& que nous sommes à genoux les uns devant les autres\" (meaning \"and that we are kneeling before each other\") is omitted. This omission removes a powerful image that graphically illustrates the mutual and reciprocal nature of the irrational worship being described, thereby weakening the satirical impact and shifting the reader's perception of the extent of the folly.","The French \"donner des crises à ses Malades\" refers to the astrological belief that celestial bodies could directly influence illnesses by causing \"crises\" (critical turning points). The translation \"to give a Judgment on their Distempers\" changes this to a more intellectual or divinatory act of diagnosis or prognosis. This significantly alters the described nature of the Moon's supposed influence from a direct (pseudo-physical) causation to a form of assessment, subtly manipulating the reader's understanding of the scientific/superstitious concept being discussed.","Fontenelle states that ignorance is \"quelque chose de bien propre à être generalement répanduë\" (something quite apt/suited to be generally widespread), a fairly neutral observation. The translation \"Ignorance is naturally a very general Talent;\" introduces a strong ironic tone by calling ignorance a \"Talent.\" This is a significant stylistic and connotative shift that alters the philosopher's characterization of ignorance, making it sound more sarcastic and thus manipulating the tone perceived by the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P032: Et quelles sont ces Nouvelles seures? interrompit-elle.

This shift in pronoun alters the narrative perspective, making the information seem as if it's being conveyed to a broader audience rather than specifically to the Marquise within the dialogue, thus subtly changing the reader's engagement with the text and the immediacy of the reported discoveries.","The French 'des Terres' (lands, or territories) is translated as 'vast Countries.' The addition of the adjective 'vast' amplifies the scale of the discoveries beyond what the original text specifies. Furthermore, 'Countries' can imply more structured or politically defined regions compared to the more general 'Terres,' subtly altering the reader's perception of the nature of these lunar discoveries and making them sound more significant or organized.","The translation of 'de très hautes Montagnes' (very high mountains) as 'high Mountains' omits the intensifier 'très' (very). This omission diminishes the described scale and grandeur of the lunar mountains, subtly downplaying the extreme nature emphasized in the original French and potentially making the lunar landscape seem less imposing.","The French 'des Abîmes très profonds' (very deep abysses/chasms) is rendered as 'deep Valleys.' This translation significantly alters the original imagery and meaning. 'Abîmes' suggests immense, potentially perilous depths and a more alien or formidable landscape, whereas 'Valleys' are generally less extreme and more familiar terrestrial features. The omission of the intensifier 'très' (very) further lessens the intensity of the description, manipulating the reader's perception towards a tamer, less scientifically wondrous lunar environment than Fontenelle depicted."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P033: Vous me surprenez, reprit-elle.

The translation \"Valleys\" significantly diminishes this intensity, substituting a more common and less dramatic geographical feature. This alteration subtly changes the tone and the reader's imaginative perception, making the Moon's terrain seem less extreme or awe-inspiring than the original text suggests, potentially manipulating the reader's engagement with the 'otherness' of new worlds.","The original French \"des Terres & des Mers\" refers to land masses and seas in a general, geographical sense. The translation \"Countries and Seas\" introduces the socio-political concept of \"Countries,\" implying demarcated, possibly governed, territories on the Moon. This addition is not present in Fontenelle's original phrasing, which focuses on natural features. This subtly anthropomorphizes the lunar landscape and could manipulate the reader's perception by framing the Moon through a lens of human political organization, rather than as a purely natural, potentially alien world.","Fontenelle's original phrase \"presque tous noms de Savants\" translates to \"almost all names of Scholars/Scientists,\" indicating that most, but not all, of the lunar features being discussed were named after such individuals. The English translation \"all Names of learned Men\" omits the crucial qualifier \"presque\" (almost). This changes a nuanced statement into an absolute one, thereby overstating the case. This exaggeration subtly manipulates the reader's understanding by presenting the naming convention by scientists as more universally and exclusively applied than Fontenelle stated, potentially bolstering the perceived uniformity or completeness of scientific endeavors of the time."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P034: Mais, reprit- elle, je serois bien aise de savoir encore plus en détail comment est fait le dedans du pays.

Voicy de quoy il s'agit. Roland, Neveu de Charlemagne, étoit devenu fou, parce que la belle Angelique luy avoit préferé Médor. Un jour Astolphe, brave Paladin, se trouva dans le Paradis Terrestre, qui étoit sur la cime d'une Montagne très haute, où son Hippogriffe l'avoit porté. Là il rencontre Saint Jean, qui luy dit que pour guerir la folie de Rolan, il étoit necessaire qu'ils fissent ensemble le Voyage de la Lune. Astolphe, qui ne demandoit qu'à voir du Pays, ne se fait point prier, &amp; aussi-tôt voilà un Chariot de feu qui enleve par les airs l'apôtre e&amp; le Paladin. Comme Astolphe n'étoit pas grand Philosophe, il fut fort surpris de voir la Lune beaucoup plus grande qu'elle ne luy avoit paru de dessus la Terre. Il fut bien plus surpris encore de voir d'autres fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts, &amp; ce qui m'aurait bien surpris aussi, des Nymphes qui chassoient dans ces Forêts. Mais ce qu'il vit de plus rare dans la Lune, c'étoit un Vallon où se trouvoit tout ce qui se perdoit sur la Terre, de quelque espèce qu'il fût, &amp; les Couronnes, &amp; les Richesses, &amp; la Renommée, &amp; une infinité d'Esperances, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">le temps qu'on donne au Jeu</span></span>, &amp; les Aumônes qu'on fait faire aprés sa mort, &amp; les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes, &amp; les Soûpirs des Amans. </p><p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune. N'y eût-il que vous, Madame, repris-je en badinant, vous y avez fait aller tous ceux qu'on vous a adressez, &amp; c'est dequoy faire dans la Lune un amas considerable. Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin.</span></span> C'est que les Papes ont prétendu être Maîtres de Rome &amp; de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, &amp; la verité est qu'on ne sauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë. Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie. Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres bien conservé. En recompense il n'est pas croyable <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus.</span></span> Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, &amp; qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, &amp; sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune. Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà.</span></span> Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut</span></span>, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut.

D'icy à la Lune le changement doit être bien plus considerable. Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine; qui pourrait pousser jusqu'à la Lune, assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit. </p><p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience? De bonne foy, Madame, repliquay-je, je n'en say rien. S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, &amp; que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; &amp; si d'ailleurs nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eût ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures qu'on appelle le Genre humain? Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eût des passions si folles, &amp; des reflexions si sages; une durée si courte, &amp; des veües si longues, tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, &amp; tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">tant d'inclination à la Servitude</span></span>; une si forte envie d'être heureux, &amp; une si grande incapacité de l'être? Il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela. Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mêmes, &amp; nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">On a eté réduit à dire que les Dieux</span></span> etoient plein de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes, &amp; que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sang froid, ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire. Nous voila donc bien en seureté du côté des Gens de la Lune, dit la Marquise, ils ne nous devineront pas; mais je voudrais que nous les pussions deviner, car en verité cela inquiete, de savoir qu'ils sont là-haut, dans cette Lune que nous voyons, &amp; de ne pouvoir pas se figurer comment ils sont faits. Et pourquoi, rêpondis-je, n'avez-vous point d'inquietude sur les Habitans de cette grande Terre Australe qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe? Nous sommes portés eux &amp; nous sur un même Vaisseau dont ils occupent la Proüe, &amp; nous la Pouppe. Vous voyez que de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, &amp; qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font, &amp; vous voudriez savoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux? </p><p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"11\">un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend</span></span>, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"12\">ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux</span></span>; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"13\">disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste.</span></span> D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"14\">mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation.</span></span> De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"15\">ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre.</span></span> Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"16\">preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois.</span></span> Ah! vous me soulagez, répliqua la Marquise, votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Church-man</span></span>, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of.</p> <p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">and Grandure</span></span>, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">is well preserv'd there</span></span>; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse.</p> <p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</p> <p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</p> <p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country.

But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play</span></span>; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.)</span></span> Besides <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there;</span></span> these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after:</span></span> But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse. </p><p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">my Soul does not lodge so high</span></span>; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips. </p><p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</span></span> </p><p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures:</span></span> Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery</span></span>; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods</span></span> when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"11\">some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me</span></span>, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"12\">cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts</span></span>; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"13\">ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men.</span></span> I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"14\">But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships.</span></span> The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"15\">which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance.</span></span> But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"16\">it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it.</span></span> Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","explanations":["The addition of 'and Liberty of Conscience' introduces a contemporary English political and religious phrase (Declaration of Indulgence, 1687) into Fontenelle's text. This anachronistically frames the discussion of poetic license through a specific, charged English political lens, subtly manipulating the reader by linking the work to current debates on religious toleration and royal authority.","Translating 'un Cardinal' to 'a great Church-man' and, more significantly, 'un grand Pape' (a great Pope) to 'another great Church-man' deliberately downplays the specific high-ranking Catholic authorities. In Protestant England, this alteration diminishes the weight of Catholic endorsement for Ariosto's poem, making it sound more generic and potentially less offensive to anti-Catholic sentiments.","The translator adds the specific example 'lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men' to Fontenelle's general category of 'time lost at play/games.' This inserts a contemporary political critique not present in the original, shaping the reader's understanding of 'lost things' to include a specific type of political frustration relevant to the English context.","Fontenelle attributes the confidential remark about the Donation of Constantine to 'l'Arioste' (Ariosto). The translation changes the speaker to 'Astolpho' (a fictional character). This shift distances the controversial statement from the respected poet (and by extension, Fontenelle's narrator) and frames it as a fantastical element within the fiction, softening its critical edge on a sensitive religio-political issue.","The French 'Esprits perdus' (lost wits/minds) refers to the loss of sanity or intellect. The translation 'Folly that was ever committed' shifts this to mean foolish actions. This alters the nature of what is stored in vials on the Moon from actual lost minds to the abstract concept of folly, changing the philosophical implication.","The French 'à quelque temps delà' (some time later) is vague. The translation specifies 'seven Years after,' adding a concrete detail not present in the original. This embellishment makes the narrative seem more specific than Fontenelle intended, subtly altering the story's texture by adding uncorroborated information.","Translating 'mon Esprit' (my wit/mind) as 'my Soul' changes the meaning. The context is losing one's mind ('esprit') due to love. 'Soul' introduces a spiritual dimension not primary in 'esprit' here, altering the tone and nature of what Ariosto (as quoted) claims to have lost.","The French Marquise wittily suggests their 'Esprits' (wits) might be wasted on an unworthy person. The English translation changes this to 'Spirits' erring on something 'worthy of 'em,' and adds a confusing, unrelated clause. This distorts the Marquise's remark, altering its meaning and witty character.","Fontenelle's philosopher states he doesn't believe there are 'Hommes' (Men) on the Moon. The translation immediately adds 'but some other odd sort of Creatures.' This front-loads a qualification that Fontenelle unfolds more gradually, altering the pacing and impact of the initial statement by making it less stark.","The French 'Servitude' (servitude, subservience) is translated and intensified to 'servitude and Slavery.' The addition of 'Slavery,' a term with stronger and more specific connotations, heightens Fontenelle's critique of human nature beyond the original, possibly to resonate with contemporary English concerns about liberty and bondage.","The French 'On a eté réduit à dire' (One has been reduced/driven to say) suggests a conclusion born of exasperation. The translation 'It was said of old amongst the Heathens' neutralizes this tone, framing it as a mere ancient pagan anecdote. This change subtly diminishes the contemporary relevance or bite of the remark for an English audience by distancing it.","The philosopher's reaction to his own thought is changed from being 'surprised' (French: 'qui me surprend') by its likelihood to being 'satisfied' (English: 'which satisfies me'). This alters the character's expressed attitude, suggesting contentment rather than unexpected astonishment, thereby manipulating the perception of his intellectual stance.","The original French states pre-Columbian Americans hadn't conceived of men being 'portez par des Animaux' (carried by animals). The translation incorrectly changes this to an inability to imagine men being 'cover'd by Skins of Beasts' (wearing animal skins). This significant error substitutes a different, incorrect example of primitive understanding, misrepresenting Fontenelle's argument.","The translator adds a lengthy direct quotation attributed to 'the wondring Indians' detailing their supposed reaction to the Europeans' arrival. This dramatic outcry is not present in Fontenelle's text, which describes their perception more generally. This addition theatricalizes the scene and inserts uncorroborated dialogue, manipulating the reader's experience.","Fontenelle states early flight attempts are like 'les premieres planches... le commencement de la Navigation.' The translation adds an elaboration: 'and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships.' This addition spells out the subsequent development, making the analogy more explicit and didactic than the original.","Fontenelle states the Romans' limited worldview had 'grandeur en un sens, & beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre' (grandeur in one sense, and much ignorance in another). The translation changes 'beaucoup d'ignorance' to 'as much of Grandure as Ignorance,' equating the two quantities. This alters the original's emphasis, which allows for ignorance to potentially outweigh grandeur.","The implied French '[l'esprit]' (the mind) where truth enters is translated as 'the Soul.' This recurring shift from 'mind/wit' (esprit) to 'Soul' elevates the concept from an intellectual process to a more profound, spiritual one, subtly changing the philosophical tone of Fontenelle's statement about truth and learning."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">TROISIEME SOIR.

Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paie point de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Sentences</span></span>, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">voltigent irrégulierement</span></span> autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voilà <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">le malheur</span></span>. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion</span></span> sur les Habitans de la Lune; conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">gros nüages</span></span> qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">l'action du Soleil</span></span> sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre</span></span>, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent</span></span>, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.

We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, as the Earth is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change; there lies the difficulty: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are at from the Moon. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination and a Kindness for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling. It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon (for certainly it emits Vapours;) and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain: And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence; so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, with a little Knowledge; but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but I told her, 'twas more proper to reserve <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">our Fancies and Notions</span></span> till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them.

The translation \"our Fancies and Notions\" softens this, making the concepts sound more like general ideas or thoughts rather than the more fantastical \"chimeras.\" This subtly alters the initial framing of their philosophical explorations, potentially downplaying their speculative boldness.","The French \"Conversations savantes\" (learned/scholarly conversations) is translated as \"Philosophical Entertainment.\" This significantly tones down the intellectual weight of the discussions, reframing them as a lighter, more leisurely activity (\"Entertainment\") rather than serious scholarly exchange (\"savantes\"). This could subtly diminish the perceived intellectual seriousness of the work or the Marquise's engagement, possibly to make it seem more like a genteel pastime.","The French \"Sentences\" (maxims, pithy sayings), in the phrase \"Je ne me paie point de Sentences\" (I am not satisfied with/don't care for mere maxims), is rendered as \"fair Words\" within the statement \"I am not to be deluded... with fair Words.\" This shifts the Marquise's objection from a dismissal of abstract pronouncements to an accusation of being deceived (\"deluded\") by mere rhetoric, thus altering her tone from impatient to suspicious.","The French \"voltigent irrégulierement\" (flutter/hover irregularly) describes the movement of clouds. The translation \"move regularly\" directly contradicts the original, changing a descriptive detail about a natural phenomenon and thus altering the factual information presented.","The French \"le malheur\" (the misfortune/unhappiness), in the phrase \"voilà le malheur\" (there is the misfortune), conveys a stronger emotional weight and sense of a problematic issue than \"the difficulty\" in \"there lies the difficulty.\" This translation tones down the philosopher's original expression of concern or disappointment to a more neutral observation.","The Marquise's direct request in French \"Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion\" (Settle me quickly on an opinion / Give me a firm opinion) is mistranslated as \"therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion\". The original shows the Marquise seeking certainty from the philosopher. The translation introduces a confusing and contradictory statement, altering the dynamic of the conversation and obscuring the Marquise's clear desire for a resolution.","The French \"gros nüages\" means large or thick clouds. The translation \"thick and black Clouds\" adds the specific descriptor \"black,\" which is not in the original. This addition intensifies the imagery of the clouds, potentially making them seem more ominous or substantial than intended by Fontenelle, thus shifting the reader's perception.","The original French \"l'action du Soleil\" (the action of the Sun) is a general statement. The translation expands this to \"the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun.\" This addition incorporates terminology and concepts (\"attracting,\" \"influence\") resonant with Newtonian physics (Newton's *Principia* published 1687, Fontenelle 1686). This subtly modernizes Fontenelle's text, potentially aligning it with more recent scientific developments for the English audience and making the philosopher's explanation seem more informed by specific gravitational theories than the original implies.","The original French states it is sufficient that lunar air be \"un peu different\" (a little different) from Earth's air, and lunar vapours \"un peu differentes\" from Earth's vapours. The translation changes this logic to a proportional statement: lunar air \"is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other.\" This imposes a more complex and specific logical relationship (a ratio of differences) not present in Fontenelle's simpler assertion of slight, independent differences, subtly altering the scientific reasoning presented.","The French \"voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent\" (there its Inhabitants are reborn/reappear) conveys a vivid, almost triumphant moment of intellectual revival for the lunar inhabitants. The translation \"which furnish it with Inhabitants\" is far more passive and functional, losing the dramatic agency and the sense of \"rebirth.\" This diminishes the original's literary flair and the excitement of the philosophical argument.","The Marquise's original statement \"il faut s'en consoler\" (one must console oneself for it / we must take comfort in that) suggests finding solace or acceptance despite the preceding admission of ignorance. The translation \"we must have patience\" shifts the meaning, implying a need to wait or endure, rather than to find comfort in the current state of (limited) knowledge. This alters the nuance of the Marquise's philosophical resignation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empêcher la <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">communication des deux Planetes</span></span>.

The translation \"Communication and Commerce of these two Planets\" adds the specific term \"Commerce,\" implying trade or economic exchange. This addition narrows the scope of potential interaction from Fontenelle's more general philosophical and scientific considerations to include material transactions, subtly shifting the reader's perception of the nature of inter-planetary relationships discussed.","Fontenelle's simple metaphorical statement \"L'eau est l'air des Poissons\" (Water is the air of Fish) is made more formal and technical by translating \"l'air\" (air) as \"the Air and Element\". This addition of \"Element\" (referring to a natural environment or a classical component) subtly shifts the tone from Fontenelle's accessible, elegant style to a more scholastic one. This pattern of adding \"and Element\" to \"Air\" (also seen with \"l'Air des Oiseaux\" translated as \"the Air and Element of Birds\" in the same passage) collectively alters the popularizing character of Fontenelle's prose.","The French \"chacun a pour prison l'air qu'il respire\" uses the strong, evocative metaphor \"prison\" to emphasize the inescapable nature of an organism's dependence on its specific atmospheric environment, carrying a connotation of harsh restriction. The translation \"every one of 'em are confin'd to the Air which they breath\" replaces \"prison\" with the much milder and more neutral phrase \"confin'd to.\" This significantly weakens the original metaphor, changing the tone from stark and forceful to descriptive, thereby reducing the impact of Fontenelle's imagery.","Fontenelle's \"se noyeroit\" (would be drowned) creates a vivid and somewhat paradoxical image of a lunar inhabitant \"drowning\" in Earth's denser air, extending the water/air analogy. The translation \"wou'd be drown'd and suffocated\" adds \"and suffocated.\" While drowning implies suffocation, the addition makes the description more explicit and somewhat clinical. This slightly dilutes the unique metaphorical force of \"drowning\" in a different kind of air by appending a more general physiological consequence, subtly shifting the focus from the striking analogy to a more standard explanation of death by asphyxiation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P043: Oh, que j'aurois d'envie, s'écria la Marquise, qu'il arrivât <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">quelque grand naufrage</span></span> qui répandît icy bon nombre de ces Gens- là, dont nous irions considérer à notre aise les figures extraordinaires!

But, answer'd I, if they had Skill enough to sail upon the external Surface of our Air, and that from thence they shou'd catch us, like Fish, out of a Curiosity of seeing us; wou'd that please you, Madam? Why not, said she, laughing? I wou'd go of my self into their Nets, to have the satisfaction of seeing those that had caught me. Consider, said I, that you wou'd be very weak and feeble, before you come to the Surface of our Air; for we cannot breath it in all its Extent, and we can hardly live on the Tops of high Mountains; and I wonder that those who are so foolish as to believe, that Corporeal Geniuses inhabit the purest Air, do not tell us why these Geniuses visit us so seldom, and stay so short a while: I do believe, 'tis because few amongst 'em know how to dive; and that even those who are skilful in that Art, have great difficulty to penetrate the grossness of the Air which we breath. You see therefore, that Nature has set many Bars and Fences, to hinder us from going out of our World, into that of the Moon.

Some of late pretend, that the Air of it self is blew, as well as the Water of the Sea; and that that Colour is not apparent in the one, nor the other, but at a great depth: The Heavens, say they, in which are plac'd the fixed Stars, has of it self no Light; and by consequence, ought to appear black: But we see it through our Air, which is blew; and therefore the Heavens appear of that Colour. If it be so, the Beams of the Sun and Stars cannot pass through the Air, without taking a little of its Tincture, and at the same time lose as much of their own natural Colour: But supposing the Air had no Colour of it self, 'tis certain, that a Flambeau, seen at a distance, through a thick Fog, appears of a reddish Colour, tho' that be not natural to it; so all our Air, which is nothing else but a thick Fog, must certainly alter the true natural Colour of the Heavens, Sun and Stars to us; for nothing but the pure heavenly Substance is capable to convey to us Light and Colours, in their Purity and Perfection, as they are: So that the Air of the Moon is of another nature than our Air, or is, of it self, of an indifferent Colour; or, at least, is another Fog, changing, in appearance, the Colours of the Celestial Bodies.

This embellishment adds a vivid detail that shapes the reader's perception of the event, making it more sensational than the simpler original.","The original French emphasizes the 'très peu de durée' (very short duration) of the dives these 'Geniuses' can make into Earth's thick air. The translation shifts this to their 'great difficulty to penetrate the grossness of the Air'. This changes the focus from a limitation in endurance or ability (short dives) to a negative quality of Earth's air ('grossness'), subtly altering the reason for the Geniuses' brief visits and introducing a pejorative characteristic to our atmosphere.","The French 'barrieres naturelles' (natural barriers) is translated as 'Bars and Fences.' 'Bars and Fences' are typically artificial constructs, suggesting a more deliberate or designed impediment imposed by Nature, rather than simply inherent natural obstacles. This subtly shifts the imagery from passive natural limitations to more active, purposeful restrictions, potentially personifying Nature or implying a designed confinement.","The French 'pour notre consolation' (for our consolation/comfort) implies that speculating about the Moon is a way to compensate for the inability to physically go there. The translation 'for our Satisfaction' changes the motivation to the fulfillment of curiosity or intellectual desire. This alters the emotional framing of their philosophical inquiry from seeking comfort for a limitation to achieving intellectual gratification.","The French 'Je croy' (I believe) expresses a degree of conviction or reasoned belief. The translation 'I fansie' (I fancy/imagine) significantly weakens this, suggesting the philosopher's idea is based more on imagination, whim, or light speculation rather than a considered opinion. This subtly undermines the seriousness or scientific grounding of the assertion about celestial colours.","The French 'prétendent' means 'claim,' 'assert,' or 'maintain,' a neutral term for stating a hypothesis. The English verb 'pretend' in the translation, by the late 17th century, often carried a strong connotation of falsehood or making an insincere claim. This choice of word subtly discredits the 'Modernes' (contemporary scientists or thinkers) and their theories about the color of the air, potentially reflecting or encouraging skepticism towards new scientific ideas.","The French 'dans toute leur pureté' (in all their purity) is translated as 'in their Purity and Perfection.' The addition of 'and Perfection' is an embellishment not present in the original text. While 'purity' itself denotes a high quality, 'Perfection' intensifies this, ascribing an even more idealized or flawless nature to the light and colors from the 'heavenly Substance,' thereby subtly enhancing its qualities beyond the original description.","The French 'd'une autre couleur' means 'of another color,' indicating a different, potentially specific, hue for the Moon's air. The English translation 'of an indifferent Colour' implies a neutral, non-distinct, or perhaps colorless quality. This changes the original meaning by replacing the idea of a 'different color' (which could be any tint) with one that is 'indifferent' (lacking in strong chromatic character or effect), thus altering the described potential characteristics of the lunar atmosphere.","The French 'à l'égard des Gens de la Lune' (regarding/for the People of the Moon) directly discusses the implication for lunar inhabitants, assuming their perspective for the sake of argument. The English translation prefaces this with 'if there be Inhabitants in the Moon,' introducing an explicit conditional that makes their existence more hypothetical in this concluding remark. This subtly injects a degree of doubt or tentativeness about lunar life not as prominent in the French phrasing of this specific statement."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy.

The addition of 'half' suggests a significantly poorer effect than the original implies, altering the perceived degree of the Marquise's dissatisfaction.","The original simple terms 'un habit, ou un meuble' (a garment, or a piece of furniture) are elaborated into more complex activities: 'fitting of Furniture for a Room, or chusing a Garniture for a Suit of Cloths.' This expansion makes the philosopher's comparison more detailed, subtly altering its tone by making it more specific and possibly more pointed towards mundane domestic concerns.","The original French 'pour la Lune' (for the Moon) is general. The translation adds 'agreeable to the Inhabitants of the Moon,' explicitly focusing Nature's design on the inhabitants' pleasure. This addition shifts perception by specifying a teleological purpose not directly stated in the source.","The French 'Je reconnois son adresse' (I recognize/acknowledge her skill) suggests an immediate realization. The English 'I know the Skill of Nature perfectly well' implies deep, pre-existing, and complete understanding. This alters the Marquise's tone, making her sound more assertive and confidently knowledgeable than the original suggests.","The French 'Ciel rouge' (red sky) uses a general term for the color. The English translation 'Heaven of Scarlet' specifies a vivid shade. This change subtly alters the visual imagery, potentially making the imagined lunar sky seem more dramatic or intense, thereby shifting the reader's perception.","The French 'elle nous a mis dans l'imagination certaines Lunettes' (she has put in our imagination certain glasses) emphasizes perception as an internal, imaginative construct. The English 'Nature has given every one of us a Perspective-glass, or Tube' makes the metaphor more concrete, like a physical instrument (even if still figurative). This subtly shifts the understanding of subjective perception from a mental faculty to an external-like filter.","The French 'le Spectacle' refers to the overall scene or view. The English translation 'the Object' narrows this to a more singular, specific item. This reduction in scope subtly alters the meaning by focusing the comparison on discrete things rather than the entirety of what is seen.","The original French 'd'imagination à imagination' (from imagination to imagination) points to the subjective variability inherent in the faculty of imagination itself. The English 'from one Man to another' shifts this focus to differences between individuals. This alters the philosophical nuance, changing the locus of perceptual difference from the psychological faculty to social variance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, répliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mêmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

The English translation alters this by introducing specific properties of the sunbeams ('oblique and faint') and a mechanism ('have not strength to penetrate the grosness and thickness of the Air') not present in the original. This addition of interpretative scientific detail shifts Fontenelle's simpler, more geometrical explanation to a different physical mechanism, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the scientific point.","The French phrase 'par dessus ce qui nous est dû' signifies that the light of dawn and twilight is an extra, unmerited gift or bonus from Nature. The English translation 'by the by, or, as it were, by chance,' fundamentally changes this connotation from a deliberate, albeit unearned, 'grace' to something casual, accidental, or haphazard. This shift in wording manipulates the reader's perception of Nature's workings, subtly diminishing the idea of a purposeful provision.","The original French uses 'Vous' (you), directly addressing the Marquise (who is imagining herself on the Moon), which creates an engaging and personal tone. The English translation changes this to a detached third-person observation ('the Inhabitants of the Moon') and inserts 'I suppose,' making the philosopher's statement more speculative and less authoritative. Furthermore, 'l'arrivée du Soleil' (the arrival of the Sun, meaning sunrise) is incorrectly translated as 'the glorious Appearance of the Sun at Noon,' a factual error that misrepresents the described phenomenon. These changes alter the narrative style, reduce the perceived certainty of the scientific explanation, and introduce misinformation.","The French text attributes the phenomenon of dawn to 'la grossiereté de l'air & des vapeurs' (the coarseness of the air and vapors). The English translation simplifies this to 'the thickness of our Air,' omitting 'des vapeurs' (and vapors) as a contributing factor. This omission alters Fontenelle's scientific explanation by removing one of the elements he considered responsible for dawn, thus presenting a less complete account than the original and subtly shifting the reader's understanding of the proposed cause.","Fontenelle's French provides a concise explanation: 'l'Arc-en-ciel se forme dans les nuages d'ou tombent les pluyes' (the rainbow forms in the clouds from which rain falls). The English translation significantly expands on this by adding specific details not present in the original, such as 'Exhalations and Vapours, condens'd into black Clouds' and the optical mechanism 'by divers Reflections and Refections of the Sun-beams upon these Clouds.' This addition of unsolicited scientific detail makes Fontenelle's popular science appear more technically elaborate or 'advanced' than it was in the original, manipulating the reader's perception of the source text's scientific depth.","The French 'nous devons les plus belles choses du monde à celles qui le sont le moins [belles]' (we owe the most beautiful things in the world to those that are the least [beautiful]) employs a subtle understatement. The English translation transforms this into a much starker and more heavily connotated statement: 'So that we owe the Obligation of the most agreeable and pleasant Effects, to the ugliest and most dis- agreeable Causes in Nature:'. The phrase 'the ugliest and most dis- agreeable Causes' is a significant intensification of 'celles qui le sont le moins,' changing the tone from nuanced reflection to a forceful pronouncement, thereby altering the original's subtler philosophical point about the origins of beauty.","The French text poses the question: 'à quoy ressembleront les Belles de ce Pays-là?' (what will the Beauties/beautiful women of that land resemble/be like?). This is a speculative query about the nature or appearance of inhabitants in a different world. The English translation changes this to: 'To what then can the Lovers in the Moon compare their Mistresses, without these two things?'. This fundamentally alters the meaning by shifting the focus from the intrinsic nature of the 'Belles' themselves to a practical problem for 'Lovers' in finding poetic similes. This narrows Fontenelle's broader philosophical musing to a more conventional, romantic literary concern, manipulating the reader's understanding of the original question's scope."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P048: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Je n'aurois pas grand regret à ces comparaisons là</span></span>, dit la Marquise, &amp; je trouve qu'on est assez bien recompense dans la Lune, de n'avoir ny Aurore ny Arc-en- ciel, car on ne doit avoir par la même raison ny Foudres ny Tonnerres, puisque ce sont aussi des choses qui se forment dans les nüages.

Vous me faites voir la Lune comme un séjour enchanté, répondis-je; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">cependant je ne say s'il est si délicieux d'avoir toûjours sur la tête, un Soleil ardent dont aucun nüage ne modère la chaleur.</span></span> Peut-être aussi est-ce à cause de cela que la Nature a creusé dans la Lune des especes de Puits, qui sont assez grands pour être apperçus par nos Lunettes; car ce ne sont point des Vallées qui soient entre des Montagnes, ce sont des creux que l'on voit au milieu de certains lieux plats. Que sait-on si les Habitans de la Lune, incommodez par l'ardeur perpetuelle du Soleil, ne se refugient point dans ces grands Puits? Ils n'habitent peut-être point ailleurs, c'est là qu'ils bâtissent leurs Villes. Nous voyons icy que la Rome soûterraine êtoit presque aussi grande que la Rome qui est sur Terre. Il ne faudroit qu'ôter celle-cy, le reste seroit une Ville à la manière de la Lune. Tout un Peuple est dans un Puits, &amp; d'un Puits à l'autre il y a des chemins soûterrains pour la <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">communication des Peuples</span></span>. Vous vous moquez de cette vision, j'y consens de tout mon cur; cependant, à vous parler tres serieusement, vous pourriez vous tromper plutôt que moy. Vous croyez que les Gens de la Lune doivent habiter sur la surface de leur Planete, parce que nous habitons sur la surface de la nôtre: c'est tout le contraire, puisque nous habitons sur la surface de notre Planete, ils pourraient bien n'habiter pas sur la surface de la leur. D'icy là il faut que toutes choses soient bien différentes.  </p><p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle. Vous y auriez encore plus de peine, répris-je, si vous saviez qu'un grand Philosophe de l'Antiquité a fait de la Lune le séjour des âmes qui ont merité icy d'être bien-heureuses. Toute leur felicité consiste en ce qu'elles y entendent l'Harmonie que les Corps Celestes font par leurs mouvements; mais comme il pretend que quand la Lune tombe dans l'ombre de la Terre, elles ne peuvent plus entendre cette Harmonie; alors, dit-il, ces Ames crient comme des desesperées, &amp; la Lune se hâte le plus qu'elle peut de les tirer d'un endroit si fâcheux. Nous devrions donc, répliqua-t-elle, voir arriver icy les Bienheureux de la Lune, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">car apparemment on nous les envoye aussi; &amp; dans ces deux Planetes on croit avoir assez pourveu à la felicité des Ames, de les avoir transportées dans un autre Monde.</span></span> Serieusement, repris-je, ce ne seroit pas un plaisir mediocre de voir plusieurs Mondes differens. Ce Voyage me réjoüit quelquefois beaucoup à ne le faire qu'en imagination, &amp; que seroit-ce, si on le faisoit en effet? Cela vaudroit bien mieux que d'aller d'icy au Japon, c'est- à-dire de ramper avec beaucoup de peine d'un point de la Terre sur un autre, pour ne voir que des hommes. Eh bien, dit-elle, faisons le Voyage des Planètes comme nous pourrons; qui nous en empêche? Allons nous placer dans tous ces differens points de veuê, &amp; de là considérons l'Univers. N'avons- nous plus rien à voir dans la Lune? Je croy que non, répondis-je du moins je vous y ay fait voir tout ce qui êtoit de ma connoissance. Au sortir de la Lune en tirant vers le Soleil, on trouve Vénus. Sur Vénus je reprens le Saint-Denis. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Vénus tourne sur elle-même, &amp; autour du Soleil comme la Lune</span></span>, on découvre avec les Lunettes d'approche, que Vénus aussi bien que la Lune est tantôt en Croissant, tantôt en Décours, tantôt pleine selon les diverses situations où elle est à l'égard de la Terre. La Lune, selon toutes les apparences, est habitée, pourquoy Vénus ne le sera-t-elle pas aussi? Mais, interrompit-elle, en disant toüjours Pourquoy non, vous m'allez mettre des Habitans dans toutes les Planètes? N'en doutez pas, répliquay-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">ce Pourquoy a une vertu qui suffira pour peupler tout.</span></span> Nous voyons que toutes les Planètes sont de la même Nature, toutes des Corps opaques qui ne reçoivent de la lumière que du Soleil, qui se la renvoyent les uns aux autres, &amp; qui n'ont que les mêmes mouvements, jusque là tout est égal. Cependant, il faudroit concevoir que ces grands Corps auroient êté faits pour n'être point habitez, que ce seroit là leur condition naturelle, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">qu'il y aurait une exception justement en faveur de la Terre toute seule.</span></span> Qui voudra le croire, le croye; pour moi, je ne m'y puis pas resoudre? Je vous trouve, dit-elle, bien affermy dans vôtre opinion depuis quelques instans. Je viens de voir le moment que la Lune seroit deserte, &amp; que vous ne vous en souciîez pas beaucoup, &amp; presentement si on osoit vous dire que toutes les Planetes ne sont pas aussi habitées que la Terre, je voy bien que vous vous mettriez en colere. Il est vray, répondis-je, que dans le moment où vous venez de me surprendre, si vous m'eussiez contredit sur les Habitans des Planetes, non seulement je vous les aurois soutenus, mais je crois que je vous aurois dit comment ils êtoient tous faits. Il y a des momens pour croire, &amp; je ne les ay jamais si bien crûs que dans celuy là; presentement que je suis un peu plus de sens froid, je ne laisse pas de trouver qu'il seroit bien étrange que la Terre fût aussi habitée qu'elle l'est, &amp; que les autres Planètes ne le fussent point du tout; car ne croyez pas que nous voyions tout ce qui habite la Terre; il y a autant d'espèces d'Animaux invisibles que de visibles. Nous voyons depuis l'Eléphant jusqu'au Ciron; là finit notre veuë; mais au Ciron commence une multitude infinie d'Animaux, dont il est l'Eléphant, &amp; que la simple veuë ne sauroit apercevoir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">On a vu avec des Lunettes beaucoup de Liqueurs toutes remplis de petits Animaux</span></span> que l'on n'aurait jamais soupçonnez d'y être, &amp; il y a quelque apparence que le goût quelles font sentir, sont les piqueures que ces petits Animaux font à la langue &amp; au palais. Mêlez de certaines choses dans quelques-unes de ces Liqueurs, ou exposez-les au Soleil, ou laissez-les se corrompre, voilà aussi-tôt de nouvelles especes de petits Animaux. </p><p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut. Une feüille d'Arbre est un petit Monde habité par des Vermisseaux invisibles, à qui elle paroît d'une étenduë immense, qui y connaissent des Montagnes &amp; des Abîmes, &amp; qui d'un côté de la feüille à l'autre, n'ont pas plus de communication avec les autres Vermisseaux qui y vivent, que nous avec nos Antipodes. A plus forte raison, ce me semble, une grosse Planete sera-t-elle un Monde habité. On a trouvé jusque dans des especes de pierres tres dures de petits Vers sans nombre, qui y étoient logez de toutes parts dans des <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">vuides insensibles</span></span>, &amp; qui ne se nourrissoient que de la substance de ces pierres qu'ils rongeaient. Figurez-vous combien il y avoit de ces petits Vers, &amp; pendant combien d'années ils subsistoient de la grosseur d'un grain de sable; &amp; sur cet exemple, quand la Lune ne seroit qu'un amas de rochers, je la ferois plutôt ronger par ses Habitans que de n'y en pas mettre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">Enfin tout est vivant, tout est animé : mettez toutes ces especes d'Animaux nouvellement découvertes, &amp; même toutes celles que l'on conçoit aisément qui sont encore à découvrir, avec celles que l'on a toûjours veuës, vous trouverez assurément que la Terre est bien peuplée, &amp; que la Nature y a si liberalement répandu les Animaux, qu'elle ne s'est pas mise en peine que l'on en vît seulement la moitié. Croirez-vous qu'aprés qu'elle a poussé icy sa fecondité jusqu'à l'exces, elle a êté pour toutes les autres Planètes d'une stérilité à n'y rien produire de vivant</span></span>?</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P036: I do much regret that loss, said the Marquiese, for in my Opinion, the Inhabitants of the Moon are fully recompens'd for the want of the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light, since for the same Reason, they have neither Thunder nor Lightning, both which are produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations; they enjoy bright serene Days, and never lose the Sun by Day, nor the Stars by Night. They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another. You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other? Seriously, said I, Madam, 'twould be a great Pleasure and Satisfaction to see several different Worlds; and I am often glad, to make these Journeys in Imagination; what joy then it wou'd be to do it in reality; that wou'd be far better than to travel from hence to Iapan, crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again. Well, said she, what hinders, but we shou'd make a Journey through the Planets as well as we can? Let us by imagination place our selves in several Positions, and situations, fit for considering the Universe. Have we no more to see in the Moon? No, said I, at least, I have shown you all I know. Going out of the Moon towards the Sun, the first Planet you meet with is Venus; and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis. Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, as the Moon does round the Earth; and by the means of Telescopes, we discover that Venus waxes and wanes, being sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened according to her different Positions in respect to the Earth.</p> <p>P037: By all appearance the Moon is inhabited, why shou'd not Venus be so, as well as she? Ay, but interrupted the Marquiese by your why nots, you will people all the Planets. Do not doubt of it, Madam, answer'd I; why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all? We see that all the Planets are of the same Nature, that they are all Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun; which they send one to another by Reflection, and that they have all the same kind of motion; thus far equal, and after all this must we conceive that all these vast Bodies were made not to be inhabited? And that Nature has made only an exception in Favor of the Earth, he that will believe this, may, but for my part I cannot. I find you, said the Marquiese, very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited. It is true, Madam, in the minute wherein you have surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me, as to the Inhabitants of all the Planets, I wou'd not only have defended my opinion, but have proceeded, to have given you an exact description of all the several Inhabitants of the Planets. There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it. The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there. And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates. If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,) and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures. Several Bodies, which appear to be solid, are nothing else but Collections or little heaps of these imperceptible Animals; who find there as much room, as is requisite for them to move in. The leaf of a Tree, is a little World inhabited, by such invisible little Worms: To them this leaf seems of a vast Extent, they find Hills and Valleys upon it: And there is no more Communication between the living Creatures on the one side, and those on the other, than between us and the Antipodes. And I think there is more reason, to believe a Planet (which is so vast a Body) to be inhabited. There has been found in several sorts of very hard Stones, infinite multitudes of little Worms, lodg'd all over them in insensible varieties; and who are nourish'd upon the Substance of these Stones which they eat. Consider the vast Numbers of these little Animals, and how long a tract of Years they have liv'd upon a grain of Sand. And by this Argument, tho my Moon were nothing but a confus'd heap of Marble Rocks, I wou'd rather make it be devour'd and consum'd by its Inhabitants, than to place none at all in it.</p>","aiHtml":"<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\"></span></span><p>P036: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">I do much regret that loss</span></span>, said the Marquiese, for in my Opinion, the Inhabitants of the Moon are fully recompens'd for the want of the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light, since for the same Reason, they have neither Thunder nor Lightning, both which are produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations; they enjoy bright serene Days, and never lose the Sun by Day, nor the Stars by Night.

The French indicates she would *not* have much regret regarding certain lunar conditions, while the English states she *does* much regret their loss, thus altering her expressed sentiment and attitude.","The French text expresses the philosopher's speculative doubt ('I don't know if it is so delightful'). The English translation shifts this to a more assertive negative opinion ('methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable'), changing the philosopher's tone from questioning to mildly judgmental and altering the nuance of his reflection.","The translation expands 'communication des Peuples' (communication of Peoples/Nations) by adding 'and commerce'. This introduction of an economic aspect ('commerce'), not present in the original, subtly shifts the perception of potential interplanetary relationships, possibly reflecting contemporary English societal interests.","The translation significantly alters the Marquise's reasoning. In French, she suggests a reciprocal sending of souls and comments on a general belief about achieving felicity through inter-world transport. The English version changes this into a rhetorical question about Earth-Moon reciprocity that ties the definition of felicity directly and solely to the philosopher's earlier point, thereby changing the substance and focus of her argument.","The French 'comme la Lune' (like the Moon), in the context of Venus orbiting the Sun, is ambiguous or astronomically imprecise if interpreted as the Moon orbiting the Sun directly. The English translation clarifies this to 'as the Moon does round the Earth,' thereby 'correcting' Fontenelle's original phrasing. This manipulates the original by altering it to present a more scientifically accurate statement, potentially shifting the reader's perception of Fontenelle's own precision.","The philosopher's witty French remark, 'this Why has a power that will suffice to populate everything,' which comments on the rhetorical force of his own question ('Pourquoi?'), is entirely changed. The English translation substitutes it with a different, more conventional question: 'why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all?' This loses the original's clever self-reference and significantly alters the nature of the philosopher's point.","The translation introduces 'Nature has made,' personifying Nature as the explicit agent responsible for Earth being an exception. Fontenelle's original French 'qu'il y aurait une exception' (that there would be an exception) is more passive and observational. This addition subtly injects a stronger teleological or deistic nuance, potentially aligning the text with specific philosophical views prevalent in England at the time.","The French 'Lunettes' (literally 'glasses,' can refer to lenses, telescopes, or microscopes depending on context) is general. The English translation specifies 'The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes,' adding concrete information about the instrument and its novelty not present in the original. This explicitness shifts perception by making the observation seem more tied to recent, specific scientific advancements.","The French 'vuides insensibles' accurately describes 'imperceptible voids' or 'tiny empty spaces' where the worms are lodged within stones. The English translation 'insensible varieties' is a mistranslation that fundamentally alters the meaning, making little sense in context and obscuring the description of the worms' physical habitat.","This entire concluding passage from the original French, which serves as a powerful summation of the philosopher's argument for universal life based on Nature's observed fecundity on Earth and ends with a challenging rhetorical question, is omitted in the English translation. This significant omission curtails the argument, weakens its impact, and alters the reader's perception of its overall force and completeness."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P051: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë, dit la Marquise,</span></span> mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planètes, &amp; embarrassée de la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux; car je voy bien que la Nature, selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela?

This added text manipulates the reader's understanding by altering the conversational context, making the Marquise's words a response to arguments Fontenelle did not write here, thus shifting the perception of the dialogue's flow and the philosopher's preceding contribution.","The French 'il faudroit encore trouver' (one would still need to find/it would still be necessary to find) implies a hypothetical exercise or an ongoing process of discernment. The English translation changes this to a declarative assertion: 'Nay, there is a certain resemblance...'. Furthermore, the addition of 'or Race of Men' to specify 'Famille' (family/lineage) introduces a term ('Race') with distinct and potentially more loaded connotations than the original, subtly shifting the categorization.","The original French poses a rhetorical question ('Quel secret doit avoir eu la Nature...') that emphasizes wonder about the unknown mechanism behind Nature's variety. The English translation transforms this into a declarative statement ('Yet it is wonderful to observe...') and adds the specific, unpresent quantifier 'how many Millions of Times'. This shifts the tone from philosophical speculation about a 'secret' to an observation of a numerically vast (though still 'wonderful') phenomenon, subtly altering the nature of the inquiry.","The French statement 'le raisonnement se forme entierement par l'experience' translates to 'reason is formed entirely by experience.' The English translation adds 'and made perfect,' introducing a qualitative judgment and an element of teleology (achieving an ideal state of 'perfection') that is not present in the original French. This subtly manipulates the meaning by suggesting a more complete or idealized outcome of experience on reason.","The French '& on s'ennuye' means 'and one gets bored' or 'and they are bored,' directly stating a condition or feeling experienced by the inhabitants of the loveless planet. The English translation changes this to 'which must render their Lives very irksom,' reframing boredom as an inevitable consequence that makes their lives 'very irksom' (a strong term). This shifts from a state of being to a more definitive and intensely negative impact on their lives, subtly altering the portrayal of their existence.","The French 'pour la distribution du bonheur où des talens' refers to 'for the distribution of happiness or talents,' implying a varied allocation of positive attributes by Nature. The English translation changes this to 'by making some happy, others miserable.' This introduces the strong negative 'miserable' and creates a stark dichotomy not explicit in the original phrase. This manipulation alters the concept from Nature's varied distribution of good things to an active creation of misery alongside happiness, potentially reflecting a more dualistic worldview."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">en quittant le ton serieux</span></span>? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Vous ay-je dubité assez de chimeres?</span></span> Vrayment, répondit-elle, il me semble que j'ay presentement moins de peine à attraper les differences de tous ces Mondes.

The English translation adds an unsubstantiated judgment about these peoples' skills and motivations, stating they are 'ignorant of drawing, and designing' and are 'pleasing themselves with their extravagant and grotesque Figures.' This addition manipulates the reader's perception by portraying these people as unskilled and self-satisfied with inferior art, rather than simply having different artistic conventions as implied in the original.","The French 'Habitans' translates to 'inhabitants' and, in the context of Fontenelle's work discussing the plurality of worlds, clearly implies intelligent beings or potential civilizations. The translation to 'Animals that inhabit' significantly narrows this meaning, reducing the speculative subjects from potentially sentient beings to mere fauna. This alteration manipulates the reader's understanding by downplaying the radical philosophical implications of Fontenelle's ideas about extraterrestrial intelligent life, potentially making the concept less controversial for the contemporary English audience given the religio-political context."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: Vous m'affligez, dit la Marquise.

This substitution omits the original imagery and introduces the subjective quality 'happy.' The surrounding phrase in the target 'to the Inhabitants of Venus' also shifts perspective more explicitly to the inhabitants than the original phrasing implies for Venus itself.","The French states the Earth appears too large from Venus, implying it's too large to be the 'Shepherd's Star & Mother of Loves' (terms used earlier for Venus's role for Earth). The translation explicitly completes this thought with 'to be the Fountain of Love.' This choice alters the implied qualities by replacing the dual 'Mother of Loves & Shepherd's Star' with the singular, different metaphor 'Fountain of Love,' effectively omitting the 'Shepherd's Star' aspect in this context.","When describing the Moon's suitability, 'Mere des Amours' (Mother of Loves) is translated as 'Source of their Amours,' a less personified term. More significantly, 'Etoile du Berger' (Shepherd's Star), with its pastoral and guiding connotations, is altered to 'the lucky Star of their Intrigues,' introducing a worldly and conspiratorial tone not present in the original.","'Presider aux Amours' (to preside over the Loves), suggesting a gentle, overseeing role for the Moon, is translated as 'to give Laws to the Loves.' This implies a more direct, authoritative, and controlling influence, changing the nature of the Moon's perceived role.","The original 'ces Gens là doivent nien entendre la galanterie.' (those people must indeed understand/be experts in gallantry) is significantly altered. The translation adds 'very soft,' a characteristic not present in the source, and rephrases expertise in 'galanterie' (gallantry/courtship) as having 'the Art to please extreamly well,' shifting focus from active mastery of a social code to a more passive quality ('soft') and a resultant ability.","'Le menu Peuple' (the common people/lower classes) is translated as 'the very Mobile.' In the late 17th-century English context, 'Mobile' (from *mobile vulgus*, meaning the fickle crowd or rabble) often carried stronger negative connotations than the French 'menu Peuple.' This choice can inject a more pejorative and class-specific English social judgment.","'Plus de chaleur' (more heat) is translated as 'a more enlivening Heat.' The addition of 'enlivening' interprets the effect of the heat by suggesting it imparts vitality or animation, an attribute not explicitly stated in the more neutral French original which simply quantifies the heat.","The original 'un petit Peuple noir, brûlé du Soleil' (a small black People, burnt by the Sun) is significantly altered. 'Noir' (black) is effectively elided or softened into just 'Sun-burnt,' diminishing the direct racial descriptor. 'Peuple' (People) is elevated to 'Gentlemen,' introducing a social class distinction and changing the demographic and social implication of the original French.","'Des Danses, & des Tournois.' (Dances, and Tournaments) is translated as 'Balls and Masquerades, to entertain their Mistresses.' 'Tournois' (Tournaments), which are chivalric contests, are changed to 'Masquerades' (masked balls), a different type of social event. More significantly, the phrase 'to entertain their Mistresses' is an addition, supplying a specific, amorous motivation for these activities that is not present in the original French text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P058: Mais que sera-ce des Habitants de Mercure?

The translation \"As for the other Planets, since they are remov'd further than Mercury, towards the Firmament\" incorrectly substitutes \"Mercury\" for \"la Terre,\" altering the astronomical description of planetary positions from Mercury's vantage point and rendering the statement confused or factually incorrect.","The original French \"la plupart des Négres\" (the most part of Negroes/Black people) is a general, albeit prejudiced, reference. The translation \"the most part of our Negroes\" introduces the possessive \"our.\" In the context of 1687 England, with its increasing involvement in the slave trade, this addition could evoke and normalize colonial attitudes of possession, subtly aligning the text with the target culture's specific socio-political realities in a way not present in the source.","The French adverb \"apparemment\" (apparently, seemingly), which introduces a degree of speculation in \"car apparemment ils soûpirent après la nuit\" (for apparently they long for the night), is effectively replaced by the assertive \"no doubt\" in the English rendering (\"which, no doubt, must be much more grateful\"). This shift in modality alters the tone from conjecture to certainty, making the philosopher's assertion about the Mercurians' feelings stronger and less nuanced than in Fontenelle's original, thus manipulating the reader's perception of the statement's reliability."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P059: Je ne suis pas si touchée, dit la Marquise, de cette perte-là que sont les Habitans de Mercure, que de l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de chaleur. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Je voudrois bien que nous les soulageassions un peu.</span></span> Donnons à Mercure de longues &amp; d'abondantes pluyes qui le rafraîchissent, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">comme on dit qu'il en tombe icy dans les Pays chauds</span></span> pendant des quatre mois entiers, justement dans les saisons les plus chaudes. </p><p>P060: Cela se peut, repris-je, &amp; même nous pouvons rafraîchir encore Mercure d'une autre façon.

Its omission in the English translation means the corresponding clause \"such as are in some of the hot Countries of our Earth\" is presented as a more direct, unqualified assertion, subtly altering the epistemic status of the information.","The original French \"d'elle-même\" specifies that the remedy (for Mercury's heat) is drawn from Mercury itself (its saltpeter composition).

Fontenelle's discussion of \"gens\" on other planets implies intelligent, possibly human-like, beings, a radical idea for the time. Reducing this to \"Animal\" depersonalizes these potential inhabitants and lessens the philosophical and potentially theological challenge of the original text, potentially to make it more palatable given the socio-religious context.","The French \"Ainsi on pourrait même se passer de...\" (Thus, one could even do without...) presents a logical conclusion that the imagined cooling mechanisms for Mercury might not be necessary due to nature's adaptability. The translation \"for ought we know, the Inhabitants of Mercury want neither...\" shifts this from a philosophical deduction about possibility to a speculation based on the narrator's limited knowledge of the inhabitants' specific needs or desires.

This premature and incorrect labeling can mislead the reader about Fontenelle's scientific precision.","Fontenelle's direct statement 'Il n'y a pas moyen d'y mettre d'Habitans' (There's no way to put inhabitants there) is omitted. The English translation moves directly to the subsequent argument ('and if we judge...'), thereby losing the emphatic force and clarity of Fontenelle's initial, unequivocal assertion about the Sun's uninhabitability. This omission alters the rhetorical structure and impact.","The phrase 'we are mistaken' is an addition by the translator. Fontenelle presents a logical contrast ('mais le Soleil n'est point...') to explain why the analogy with Earth doesn't apply to the Sun. The translation's insertion of 'we are mistaken' casts the initial judgment as an error, adopting a more didactic and corrective tone not as explicit in the original.","The translation reverses the meaning of the French clause and omits a crucial qualifier. Fontenelle states planets 'ne peuvent faire, pour ainsi dire, des échanges' (cannot, so to speak, make exchanges), emphasizing their passivity in merely reflecting light. The translation 'they can exchange Light' asserts an active capability and removes the nuanced 'pour ainsi dire' (so to speak), which originally suggested that even the reflection isn't a true, self-generated exchange. This alters the scientific description of planetary light.","The French 'avec force' (with force) is translated as 'with great Force and Violence.' The addition of 'and Violence' and the intensifier 'great' creates a more dramatic and aggressive image of the Sun's light emission than Fontenelle's more neutral term, subtly changing the tone.","The phrase 'in the Air' is added by the translator to the description of light trails. Fontenelle describes light spreading 'd'une Planete à l'autre' (from one Planet to another), implying interplanetary space. 'In the Air' introduces a terrestrial, atmospheric connotation inappropriate for this context, subtly altering the cosmic scale of the description.","Fontenelle's 'tissus' (fabrics, weaves) evokes an image of intricately structured and patterned light. The translation 'Mixture' is far more generic and less vivid, diminishing the literary beauty and the specific visual metaphor Fontenelle uses, thereby flattening the reader's perception of this phenomenon.","Fontenelle's 'Aussi' (Therefore/So/Also) is rendered as 'For this end.' This translation choice imposes a stronger teleological (purpose-driven) interpretation on the Sun's central placement than the more consequential or descriptive sense of 'Aussi.' This can subtly reinforce a traditional argument from design, potentially counter to the emerging Enlightenment's more naturalistic explanations.","Fontenelle attributes the animation of things specifically to the Sun's heat ('animer tout par sa chaleur'). The translation expands this to 'livening and enlightning,' adding the concept of 'enlightning' which, while true of the Sun, is not what Fontenelle states in this particular clause concerning the effect of heat. This adds information not present in the source's specific explanation.","The translation changes Fontenelle's 'peu de temps auparavant' (a little time before) to 'a little after that time.' This incorrectly alters the timeline Fontenelle establishes for the discovery of new celestial bodies relative to the observation and interpretation of sunspots, thereby changing the historical context and the basis of the scientific reasoning being described.","The translation omits the crucial word 'pretendües' (pretended/alleged) used by Fontenelle to describe the then-hypothesized idea that sunspots were planets. By translating it as 'these new discover'd Planets,' the English version removes Fontenelle's skeptical stance on this specific interpretation, presenting it as a factual or accepted idea, which manipulates the reader's understanding of Fontenelle's critical perspective.","Fontenelle's French emphasizes the dispute over the prerogative of naming the sunspots ('le maître des taches pour les nommer' - the master of the spots for naming them). The translation 'to whom they shou'd belong' shifts the focus to a more general sense of ownership of the celestial features themselves, rather than the specific act and power of nomenclature, subtly altering the nature of the described contention among scholars and patrons."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

The translation, \"without incroaching upon 'em,\" shifts the focus, suggesting that others (presumably Princes, from context) should refrain from encroaching on the scholars' territory. This changes the agency from the scholars' active gatekeeping to a more passive expectation of non-interference by others, subtly altering the power dynamic and the scholars' depicted assertiveness.","The French \"engager aux Princes quelque Astre\" uses the verb \"engager,\" which in this context strongly implies pledging or mortgaging something as security, carrying a financial or transactional connotation. The English translation's phrase \"to take their part\" refers to the Princes' benefit from being allowed celestial territory, rather than the scholars' act of pledging. This omits the original's specific, witty metaphor about the scholars' potential material compromises or dependencies in relation to their patrons.","The French \"impuretez\" (impurities) which are described as being cast upon the sun's surface, are rendered in the English translation through the phrase \"its Scum and Dross\" being thrown upon the surface. While \"Scum\" relates to \"écumes\" mentioned earlier by Fontenelle, \"Dross\" (the metallic waste from smelting) is a specific addition here. This specification intensifies the imagery of the sun producing particular kinds of waste, adding a layer of detail that makes the analogy more concrete and perhaps baser than the original's simpler \"impuretez.\"","The French \"Aquoy se fiera-t-on?\" translates to \"What can one trust?\" or \"In what can one place trust?\", directly questioning the reliability of things, specifically the \"Lunettes\" (telescopes) just mentioned. The English translation \"To whom shall we trust then?\" changes the object of trust from an inanimate thing or method (\"what\") to a person or authority (\"whom\"). This significantly alters the nature of the skepticism, directing it towards human reliability rather than instrumental fallibility.","The French \"causée par quelque chose qui arrive dans les Lunettes\" (caused by something that happens in the telescopes/lenses) is translated as \"and that they are nothing else but the Effects of the Glasses of the Telescopes.\" The original's \"quelque chose qui arrive\" (something that happens) conveys a degree of vagueness or unknown factor regarding the cause of the visual distortion. The translation's \"Effects of the Glasses\" is more specific, implying known optical phenomena or imperfections within the lenses themselves. This shift subtly reduces the ambiguity of the original, presenting the cause as more scientifically understood or attributable than Fontenelle's phrasing might suggest.","The French \"pitoyable\" translates to \"pitiful,\" \"lamentable,\" or \"deplorable,\" conveying a significant sense of regret and sympathy regarding the sun's uninhabitability despite its ideal central location. The English translation \"Is it not hard,\" significantly lessens the emotional intensity of the original. This change in diction alters the tone, making the philosopher's reflection sound more stoic or matter-of-fact and less emotionally engaged with the described cosmic irony."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P063: J'avoüe que je m'étois trompé, répondis-je, je ne songeois qu'à la situation où est le Soleil,&amp; non à l'effet de sa lumiere; mais vous qui me redressez si à propos, vous voulez bien que je vous dise que vous vous êtes trompée aussi; les Habitans du Soleil ne le verroient seulement pas.

Il n'y a pas jusqu'au Soleil qui ne tourne; mais il ne tourne que sur luy-même, parce qu'il est justement au milieu de toute cette matiere celeste; &amp; vous remarquerez en passant, que quand la Terre seroit dans la place où il est, elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle- même. </p><p>P065: Voilà quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme le Maître; mais en même temps les Planetes se composent de petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de celuy du Soleil.

C'est là le Tourbillon particulier de la Planete &amp; elle le pousse aussi loin que la force de son mouvement se peut étendre. S'il faut qu'il tombe dans ce petit Tourbillon quelque Planete moindre que celle qui y domine, la voilà emportée par la grande &amp; forcée indispensablement à tourner autour d'elle, &amp; le tout ensemble, la grande Planete, la petite, &amp; le Tourbillon qui les renferme, n'en tourne pas moins autour du Soleil.

Vous savez bien que quand on met de l'huile avec de l'eau, l'huile surnage. Qu'on mette sur ces deux liqueurs un Corps extremement léger, l'huile le soûtiendra, &amp; il n'ira pas jusqu'à l'eau. Qu'on y mette un autre Corps plus pesant, &amp; qui soit justement d'une certaine pesanteur, il passera au travers de l'huile, qui sera trop foible pour l'arrêter, &amp; tombera jusqu'à ce qu'il rencontre l'eau, qui aura la force de le soûtenir.

But, pray, Madam, allow me to tell you, that you who have corrected me so justly, may also be mistaken your self: The Inhabitants of the Sun wou'd not so much as see it self; for they wou'd be incapable to support the dazling of his Light, or unable to receive it, by being too near; and all things well consider'd, the Sun wou'd be a Country of blind Men only. So that, once for all, I conclude, the Sun cannot be inhabited; and if you please, Madam, we will continue our Journey to the other Worlds: We are now come to the Centre, which is the lowest Point in all Circular Figures; and therefore must return back again, and go upwards. In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited.</p> <p>P049: The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and his Inhabitants see the Sun neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or Guards: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light.

In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Guards:</span></span> they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">the Tourbillions, or Whistlings</span></span> of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">they have not a fitter Object:</span></span> But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">one way, from East to West</span></span>, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">after the Creation of the Universe,</span></span> the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">forc'd its Obedience.</span></span> Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">dangerous</span></span> as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">our Earth wou'd be carry'd near</span></span> Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">it is not possible in Nature</span></span> they can remove from thence.</p>","explanations":["The translation omits the specific quantifier 'cinq fois' (five times), stating only that Mars is 'less than the Earth.' This significantly understates the size difference described by Fontenelle, altering the reader's perception of Mars's relative scale.","Translating the scientific term 'Satellites!' (a recognized astronomical term for Jupiter's moons) as 'Guards:' introduces a courtly, anthropomorphic metaphor. This shifts the tone from scientific popularization towards a more fanciful description, potentially trivializing the astronomical concept.","The addition of 'or Whistlings' as a translation for Descartes' 'Tourbillons' (vortices) is inaccurate and trivializes a key scientific concept Fontenelle is explaining. 'Whistlings' introduces an inappropriate auditory and diminutive connotation, misrepresenting the physical theory.","The original French 'qu'ils n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet' means 'that they only have the Tourbillons as their object' (i.e., her passion is solely for tourbillons). The translation 'they have not a fitter Object:' introduces a judgment that Tourbillons are an unfit subject for her passion, subtly disparaging the concept or the Marquise's intellectual engagement, contrasting with Fontenelle's encouraging tone.","The original 'en un même sens' (in the same direction) is translated as 'one way, from East to West.' The addition of the specific direction 'from East to West' for planetary orbital motion is an unverified insertion that could mislead the reader, as prograde orbital motion is typically West to East against the stars.","Changing 'au commencement du Monde' (at the beginning of the world) to the more explicitly theological 'after the Creation of the Universe,' subtly aligns the text with religious creation narratives. This may reflect an attempt to make Fontenelle's ideas more palatable in a context of heightened religious sensitivity.","The original 'tout à fait à notre bienséance' (entirely to our convenience/suitability) describes the Moon's capture as a fitting occurrence. The translation 'forc'd its Obedience.' drastically changes the tone by introducing a strong hierarchical and coercive element, depicting Earth as actively subjugating the Moon.","Translating 'entreprenante' (enterprising, audacious), which describes Jupiter with a sense of bold initiative, as 'dangerous' shifts the connotation to one of direct threat and negativity. This intensifies the Marquise's perceived fear beyond the scope of the original term.","The original French 'irions- nous soumettre à notre domination' (we would go to subject to our domination) describes an active potential act of subjugation by 'us'. The translation 'our Earth wou'd be carry'd near' changes this to a passive event concerning Earth, removing the direct agency and explicit intent of 'domination,' thus altering the perceived power dynamic.","The addition of 'in Nature' to the phrase 'it is not possible' (that planets leave their orbits) emphasizes this stability as a fundamental, intrinsic natural law. This insertion subtly reinforces the idea of a fixed, possibly divinely-ordained, cosmic order, potentially making the new cosmology seem less threatening."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P067: Je conçois, dit la Marquise, que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs.</span></span> Plût à Dieu qu'il y eût quelque chose de pareil qui les reglât parmi nous, &amp; qui fixât <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">les Gens</span></span> dans les places qui leur sont naturellement convenables.

The English translation shifts to a passive construction (\"Weights are regulated\") and adds an interpretative phrase \"according to their several degrees.\" This diminishes the concept of gravity as an active, self-governing principle and instead suggests weights conforming to a pre-defined system, subtly altering the scientific meaning.","The inclusive French term \"les Gens\" (People) is translated as the male-specific \"every Man.\" This alteration narrows the scope of the Marquise's reflection on social order, subtly reasserting a patriarchal perspective contrary to Fontenelle's aim of popularizing science for a wider audience, including women.","The French \"fort en repos\" (very much at peace/ease), indicating a positive state of calm, is translated as \"no longer in fear.\" This introduces a prior state of fear not explicit in the original, altering the Marquise's emotional tone from achieving tranquility to merely overcoming anxiety.","The French \"Je suis bien aise\" (I am very glad) is translated as the more subdued \"I am satisfy'd.\" Furthermore, the specific mention of \"avec notre Lune unique\" (with our unique Moon), which is part of a phrase repeated in the French source for emphasis, is omitted from this corresponding clause in the English translation.

This is a factual alteration of the astronomical information presented by Fontenelle, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the specific details of Jupiter's environment.","The French 'sont faites' (are made/are suited for) is translated as 'were chiefly created.' The word 'created' introduces a distinct theological implication of a divine Creator and deliberate design, which is much stronger than the more neutral or mechanistic 'sont faites.' This subtly shifts the philosophical tone, potentially aligning Fontenelle's text more with conventional religious interpretations of the cosmos prevalent in 17th-century England.","The French 'vingt & heures' suggests an approximate timeframe (around twenty hours or twenty-odd hours). The translation 'one and twenty Hours' imposes a specific, exact number (21 hours). This adds a level of numerical precision not explicitly present in the original phrasing, subtly altering the reader's perception of the information's definitiveness.","The translation significantly intensifies the original French. 'Quelque consolation' (some consolation) is a modest expression of comfort, whereas 'a very great satisfaction' implies a much stronger, more profound sense of relief or pleasure. This shift exaggerates the positive aspect of Jupiter's moons, altering the reader's perception of the balance of conditions in that environment.","The French 'non pas de frayeur' (not of fright/fear) is incorrectly translated as 'whereas they fight.' This is a significant error that completely changes the meaning of the comparison between reactions to eclipses on Jupiter versus on Earth.

For Example; The Inhabitants of that Moon next to Iupiter, see him three hundred and sixty times bigger than our one Moon appeareth to us: And as I believe that little Moon to be much nearer to Iupiter than Ours is; so his greatness must be by that considerably augmented; and they must constantly see that monstrous Planet hanging over their Heads, at a very small distance. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">And if it be true</span></span>, that the Gauls of old, apprehended the falling of the Heavens: The Inhabitants of that Moon have more Reason to fear the falling of Iupiter.

In French, 'vous ne manquerez pas' is a fairly assertive expectation or prediction ('you will not fail'). The English 'I hope' introduces a note of uncertainty or politeness not present in the original, slightly altering the Marquise's characterization and the dynamic of the conversation.","The French 'éclairer une autre' (to enlighten another [planet]) is changed to 'enlighten the Inhabitants of a greater [planet]'. This shifts the focus from the planet itself to its inhabitants. Additionally, 'ces nuits' (these nights) is changed to 'their long Nights,' adding the adjective 'long' which is an embellishment not present in the original. This subtly anthropomorphizes the purpose of the moons.","The Marquise's original wish, which is for the inhabitants of Jupiter's moons to constantly experience the sight of the massive planet suspended above them, is entirely replaced. The translation substitutes this with a wish for these inhabitants to be political 'Colonies of Iupiter,' receiving 'Laws and Manners,' and paying 'Homage and Respect.' This introduces themes of governance, colonialism, and hierarchy absent from Fontenelle's original sentence here, potentially reflecting contemporary English political concerns (e.g., colonial administration, issues of sovereignty relevant during the late 17th century in Britain). The translator then inserts a lengthy discourse by the philosopher (the 'I' in 'said I') elaborating on this political theme, which includes discussions of ambassadors, fealty, and authority, further shifting the focus of the dialogue before eventually reintroducing the visual aspect of Jupiter, but as a statement of fact from the philosopher rather than the Marquise's initial expressed desire.","The French 'En verité' (In truth, Indeed) presents the following statement about the Gauls as a known fact or a strong assertion. The English 'And if it be true' changes this into a hypothetical condition, subtly weakening the force of the Marquise's analogy and introducing a degree of doubt not present in the original.","The translator omits the descriptive adjective 'celebre' (famous, celebrated) used in the original to characterize Tycho Brahe. This omission, while small, slightly diminishes the emphasis on Tycho Brahe's renown as explicitly stated by Fontenelle.","The French phrase 'il passoit sa vie avec elles' (he spent his life with them), which emphasizes Tycho Brahe's intimate and lifelong engagement with eclipses (and thus his expert understanding contrasting with his superstitions), is omitted in the translation after 'as the Vulgar do;'. This omission removes a nuance that highlights the paradox of a great astronomer holding unrelated superstitious fears.","The original French poses a rhetorical question to the Marquise ('Mais croiriez-vous bien ce qu'il craignoit en leur place?' - But would you believe what he feared instead?), engaging her directly and creating a more interactive, conversational tone. The translation changes this into a declarative statement ('but instead of that, he fear'd,'), removing the direct address and altering the narrative style from a personal query to a more straightforward assertion.","The French 'une Vieille' specifically means 'an old woman,' an image that often carries particular superstitious connotations, especially in the context of bad omens or witchcraft in European folklore. The English translation 'were old' is more general and could refer to an old person of unspecified gender. This generalization slightly dilutes the specific folkloric imagery and potential gendered superstition implied by the original text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit- elle, après que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la</span></span>, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The translation specifies this with the addition 'from the Fear of Eclipses.' This insertion of specific information not present in Fontenelle's immediate text narrows the reader's understanding of the 'error' and subtly manipulates their perception of what the 'great Man' (a figure of science) struggled against.","Fontenelle's 'Loy commune' (common law) most likely refers to a shared human or intellectual susceptibility to making errors or holding certain beliefs. The translation expands this to 'the common Law of Nature,' which gives the concept a more deterministic and universal quality, as if it were an immutable physical law. This shift in phrasing alters the philosophical tone, framing human fallibility as an inescapable part of nature rather than a cognitive or social pattern.","The French term 'erreur' translates to 'error' or 'mistake,' which can be relatively neutral. The English translation uses 'Folly,' which carries a stronger connotation of foolishness, irrationality, or absurdity. This change in diction subtly alters the tone, portraying the anticipated misjudgments of Jupiter's inhabitants as evidence of inherent foolishness rather than mere intellectual missteps, thereby manipulating the reader's perception of these beings.","The original French phrase 'je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner' conveys a sense of humility or a disclaimer of expertise, meaning 'I don't pride myself on being able to guess it' or 'I don't claim to be able to guess it.' The translation 'But since I will not trouble my self to guess' changes the Marquise's reason for not guessing from a modest admission of limited ability to an expression of unwillingness or a conscious decision not to make an effort. This subtly alters the Marquise's characterization, shifting her from being unassuming about her predictive powers to being disinclined to speculate.","The source text mentions 'le Journal des Savants de ce Pays-là en parle' (the Journal des Savants of that country speaks of it). The 'Journal des Savants' was a prominent French scientific journal. The translation changes this to 'they set it down in the Philosophical Transactions of that Country.' This involves two alterations: firstly, the specific French journal is replaced by 'the Philosophical Transactions,' the journal of the English Royal Society, a clear act of cultural substitution (anglicization). Secondly, the action shifts from the journal 'speaking of it' (implying public dissemination and discussion) to astronomers 'setting it down in' the journal (implying a more formal, perhaps less public, act of recording). This manipulates the reader by situating the narrative within an English scientific context and altering the nature of the scientific communication described.","The original French 'il n'y a que les Gens tres raisonnables qui en veulent bien douter.' translates to 'only very reasonable people are willing to doubt it' or 'are quite prepared to doubt it.' This emphasizes active skepticism and openness to questioning prevailing ideas as a mark of rationality. The translation 'and there are but some very rational People, that will trouble themselves with the thoughts of it.' significantly weakens this, suggesting mere passive consideration or contemplation ('trouble themselves with the thoughts') rather than the more rigorous and engaged intellectual stance of 'doubting.' This subtly alters the portrayal of 'rational people' and diminishes the importance of active doubt in the process of scientific discovery as presented by Fontenelle."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P074: Si ce n'êtoit, dit la Marquise, qu'il n'est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">point trop agreable</span></span> de savoir qu'on ne nous peut découvrir de dedans Jupiter qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche, je me représenterois <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">avec plaisir</span></span> ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, comme les nôtres le sont vers luy, &amp; cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">les Planetes s'entre-considèrent</span></span> &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">demandent l'une de l'autre</span></span>, Quel monde est-ce là?

The English translation \"very disagreeable\" significantly intensifies this emotion, altering the Marquise's tone to be much stronger and more negative than in the original.","The original French \"avec plaisir\" (with pleasure) expresses simple enjoyment. The translation \"an Infinite Pleasure\" is a substantial exaggeration, ascribing a boundless or extreme quality to the Marquise's feeling that is not present in Fontenelle's more measured phrasing, thereby altering the intensity of the expressed emotion.","The French \"les Planetes s'entre-considèrent\" (the Planets consider each other) is a neutral description of the action. The translator's addition of the adverb \"gravely\" in \"those two Planets gravely considering one another\" imposes a solemn or serious tone onto the planets' mutual observation, an interpretive layer not found in the original text which subtly changes the mood of the imagined scene.","The French phrase \"demandent l'une de l'autre\" (ask one another) has \"les Planetes\" (the Planets) as its implicit subject from the conjoined verb in \"les Planetes s'entre-considèrent & demandent l'une de l'autre,\" thus personifying the planets as asking questions. The translation transforms this into \"the Inhabitants of both ask at one and the same time.\" This manipulation has two main effects: firstly, it shifts the agency of asking from the personified planets to their inhabitants, altering a key literary device. Secondly, it adds the detail \"at one and the same time,\" introducing a specific simultaneity to the act of asking that is not present in the original. Both changes subtly reshape the reader's perception of the imagined inter-planetary curiosity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P075: Cela ne va pas si vite que vous pensez, répliquay-je.

This addition introduces a pejorative judgment towards the hypothetical individual, altering the tone from neutral speculation to one of ridicule, thereby manipulating the reader's perception of such a thinker as inherently foolish.","The French 'fait le procés à des Philosophes' (put Philosophers on trial / sued Philosophers) is translated such that the consequence is 'sued and persecuted.' The addition of 'and persecuted' intensifies the consequences faced by the philosophers, suggesting more severe and systematic mistreatment beyond what 'fait le procés' (which primarily means legal trial) strictly implies. Given the religio-political tensions in 1680s England concerning challenges to authority and fears of persecution, particularly under James II, this addition could resonate with contemporary anxieties and manipulate the reader by framing Fontenelle's speculative scenario in terms of more extreme oppression.","The original French 'leurs Christophe Colombs' (their Christopher Columbuses) refers to an archetypal explorer, suggesting Jupiter would produce its own great discoverers. The translation replaces this plural archetype with the singular, specific historical figure 'Christopher Columbus' within a conditional phrase ('And had Christopher Columbus been of that Country...'). This alters the meaning by shifting from a universalist idea of exploratory figures arising in any vast world to an Earth-centric hypothetical involving a known historical figure, subtly diminishing the original's broader philosophical implication about the universality of such exploratory spirit.","The French 'ne connoissent pas seulement de réputation la centiéme partie des autres Peuples' (do not know even by reputation the hundredth part of the other Peoples) emphasizes the extreme isolation and lack of even secondhand knowledge among Jupiter's inhabitants. The English translation 'know not the hundredth part of its own Inhabitants' omits the crucial intensifier 'seulement de réputation' (even by reputation / only by reputation). This omission lessens the original's strong emphasis on the profound degree of disconnection, thereby subtly shifting the reader's perception by understating the severity of the social isolation Fontenelle describes on Jupiter.","The French 'Saturne avec les siennes.' (Saturn with its own [moons]) is a more general, literary phrasing. The translation specifies 'Saturn with the five that belong to him.' While factually correct for the period (five moons of Saturn were known by 1684, just before Fontenelle's 1686 publication), this addition of numerical specificity changes the tone from Fontenelle's more allusive literary style to a more didactic, factual assertion. It attributes a precision to the speaker not explicit in the original, subtly altering the reader's perception of Fontenelle's popularization technique, possibly to make the translation seem more rigorously scientific to an English audience keen on new astronomical data."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P076: Quoy, dit la Marquise, vous comptez cela pour une grâce?

The translation \"has discover'd to us\" changes this by attributing a more active and intentional act of revelation to Nature. This shift subtly alters the perception of Nature's role from a passive entity to an active agent in human knowledge acquisition, potentially imbuing it with conscious agency in unveiling knowledge, which could align the text with deistic views or make it more palatable to a readership accustomed to notions of providential design in an era of religious and scientific upheaval.","The French \"le prix\" refers to the inherent value or worth of Nature's 'favour' (in showing only seven planets). The English translation \"this Grace\" elevates this concept. \"Grace,\" especially in 17th-century English, carried stronger connotations of unmerited divine favour or benevolence than the more secular \"prix\" (value/worth). This change in diction introduces a more theological or pious tone not as explicit in Fontenelle's original, subtly manipulating the reader's understanding by framing humanity's lack of appreciation in terms that resonate with religious rather than purely philosophical or observational perspectives.","The original French \"qui avoient êté cachées\" (which had been hidden) employs a passive voice, leaving the agent of concealment unspecified. The English translation converts this to an active voice, explicitly identifying \"Nature\" as the agent who \"had conceal'd\" the other planets. This personification of Nature and attribution of deliberate concealment is an addition by the translator. It manipulates the reader's perception by framing the universe not just as something to be observed, but as a realm where Nature actively hides elements, making scientific discovery an act of uncovering intentional secrets, which could imply a more consciously reticent, if not adversarial, relationship between humanity and Nature."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P077: Je voy, reprit-elle, par ce nombre de seize Planetes qu'il faut que Saturne ait cinq Lunes.

The translation \"Climates in that World\" shifts the meaning by introducing \"Climates,\" which specifically implies atmospheric and environmental conditions not explicitly present in \"Pays.\" Furthermore, \"in that World\" is an expansion that makes Saturn sound more like a structured, Earth-like entity. This subtly alters the original's simpler term and changes the descriptive emphasis, potentially to make the idea of habitability more concrete for the reader.","The French original states that Saturn's ring \"refléchit perpetuellement la lumiere du Soleil dans les lieux qui ne le voyent point\" (perpetually reflects the light of the Sun in/to the places that do not see it [the Sun]). This is a neutral, physical description. The English translation significantly alters this by changing the latter part of the sentence to \"upon the Inhabitants of Saturn, who have the Misfortune to live in that Climate, that is, so long a time depriv'd of the influence of his Beams.\" This manipulation consists of: a) Shifting the focus from the impersonal \"places\" (lieux) to the specific \"Inhabitants of Saturn.\" b) Adding the judgmental and emotive phrase \"who have the Misfortune to live in that Climate,\" which introduces a negative connotation and an explicit emotional framing of suffering absent from Fontenelle's more objective tone. c) Further elaborating with \"that is, so long a time depriv'd of the influence of his Beams,\" which emphasizes the deprivation. This addition manipulates the reader's perception by dramatizing the inhabitants' plight and heightening the sense of Nature's (or Providence's) specific intervention, which aligns with emerging deistic or natural theology arguments of the period."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P078: En verité, dit la Marquise, de l'air d'une personne qui rentroit en elle-même avec étonnement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">tout cela est d'un grand ordre; il paroît bien que la Nature a eu en veüe les besoins de quelques Etres vivans</span></span>, &amp; que la distribution des Lunes n'a pas êté faite au hazard.

Further, \"la Nature a eu en veüe les besoins\" (Nature had in view/consideration the needs) is translated as \"Nature has seen and provided for the necessity.\" The addition of \"provided for\" makes Nature's role more active and overtly teleological, subtly emphasizing a benevolent, purposeful design in the universe, potentially aligning with contemporary arguments from design.","The French text refers to Venus and Mercury (\"Vénus & à Mercure\"), with \"les comptent\" implying both. The translation incorrectly narrows this to \"the Inhabitants of this Planet\" (singular). This not only introduces a factual inaccuracy by singularizing the reference but also makes the speculation about inhabitants more explicit and direct than the original's more ambiguous \"qui\" (who/which), which could refer more poetically to the planets themselves.","The French \"n'a point de Lune\" states a fact known at the time: Mars \"has no moon.\" The translation changes this to Mars \"ought to have a Moon too.\" This significantly alters the Marquise's statement from an observation of an apparent anomaly in a pattern to an expression of what she believes *should* be the case, subtly changing her tone from inquisitive to normative regarding cosmic arrangements.","The French \"il faut qu'il [Mars] ait ... des ressources\" (it [Mars] must have ... resources) focuses on the planet's unknown features. The translation shifts this to \"certainly, the Inhabitants of that Planet enjoy some other advantage.\" This not only explicitly centers the speculation on inhabitants but also introduces the word \"defect\" to describe the moon's absence—a negative framing not in the original's neutral \"ressources\"—and adds \"certainly,\" making the philosopher's assertion more definitive.","The French text uses the specific scientific term \"Phosphores naturels\" (natural Phosphors). The English translation omits this term, replacing it with a dash followed by a lengthy descriptive paraphrase: \"— great Rocks very high; which are naturally of such a kind of Substance...\". This avoidance of the precise term dilutes the scientific flavor of the philosopher's hypothesis, making it sound more vague and less grounded in a specific known or theorized phenomenon, thereby altering the tone of the scientific popularization.","The original French \"sans aucun art\" (without any art/artifice) emphasizes the natural, uncrafted quality of the hypothetical Martian illuminations. The translation adds \"or Expence.\" This introduction of a financial or practical consideration (\"without... Expence\") is an accretion not present in Fontenelle's text, subtly shifting the emphasis from purely natural wonder to include an element of cost-effectiveness, which is extraneous to the description of a natural planetary feature.","The French states simply that the light from the American birds is sufficient \"pour lire\" (to read). The translation embellishes this by adding the comparative phrase \"as well as by that of a Candle.\" This addition, while aiming to clarify the light's intensity by comparing it to a familiar artificial source, slightly exaggerates or makes more concrete the marvel, altering the original's more straightforward assertion."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oiseaux.

The English translation alters this by specifying Mars ('as well to Mars'), making the Marquise's deduction more specific and immediately setting up a contradiction with her later acknowledgement of Mars as an exception. This addition subtly manipulates the reader's perception of her reasoning.","The original French specifies 'trois échappées' (three escaped ones), providing a precise number. The English translation omits this number, stating 'had only escaped,' thereby losing a piece of specific information from Fontenelle's speculative description of Saturn's moons.","The French states directly: 'Le Soleil même n'est pour eux qu'une petite Etoile blanche & pâle' (The Sun itself is for them only a small white & pale Star). The English translation alters this to 'the Sun, where she her self appears to 'em, but as a little pale Star'. The insertion of the clause 'where she her self appears to 'em' reframes the original's objective statement into a subjective observation ('appears to 'em'). Additionally, the use of 'she' for the Sun (French 'Le Soleil' is masculine) deviates from the original's gendering and potentially alters the personification or creates ambiguity. This subtly changes the tone and directness of Fontenelle's scientific explanation.","The original text refers to 'Caton d'Utique' (Cato the Younger), a Roman Stoic known for his integrity and opposition to Caesar, symbolizing stern virtue. The English translation substitutes 'Cato the Censor,' a different Roman statesman known for his rigid morality, traditionalism, and severity. This change in the specific historical figure alters the cultural and philosophical nuance of the comparison, potentially leading the reader to a slightly different understanding of the Saturnians' extreme phlegmatic nature, possibly emphasizing old-fashioned severity over stoic gravity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P082: Il me vient une pensée, dit-elle.

Good God, said she, suffer me to be grateful for every thing; even to the very Tourbillion where I was born: The measure of the Happiness bestow'd upon us, is too little to lose any part of it; and it is good to have such a Sense and Taste of the commonest and most considerable things, as to turn all to our Advantage and Profit. If we shou'd look after no other Pleasure or Satisfaction, than this World afforded, we shou'd enjoy but very few, expect 'em long, and pay dear for 'em. If Philosophy be the Pleasure, you propose, said I, Madam, I have the Boldness to wish, that when you remember the Tourbillions, you wou'd be pleas'd to think of me.

While 'dull' can imply slowness, 'extremely dull' imposes a strong negative judgment on the Saturnians' intelligence and character, which is not necessarily present in the original 'slow,' thereby altering their depiction.","The French 'lents' (slow), referring to some people on Earth, is translated as 'insipid' (lacking vigor, interest, tasteless). This changes the characteristic from slowness, a relatively neutral descriptor of pace or temperament, to 'insipid,' a negative judgment of character, implying these people are bland or uninteresting, thus manipulating the reader's perception.","The neutral French transitional phrase 'De plus,' (Moreover/Furthermore) is replaced with 'And we have the good luck over and above,'. This addition introduces an element of chance or divine favour ('good luck') not present in the original, subtly shifting the tone of the Marquise's observation. Furthermore, 'justement dans un endroit' (precisely in a place) is changed to 'to be born in a Climate,' altering the focus from a general geographical location to the specific circumstance of birth within a climatic zone.","The French 'où je suis placée' (where I am placed/situated) has a broader, more philosophical connotation relating to one's position in the cosmos (Descartes' 'Tourbillons'). The translation 'where I was born' narrows this meaning to a specific biographical event, diminishing the philosophical scope of the Marquise's gratitude and grounding it in a more personal, less abstract context.","The French 'les moins considérables' means 'the least considerable' or 'the most insignificant.' The translation 'most considerable things' is a direct antonym, completely reversing this part of the original meaning. Fontenelle's text emphasizes appreciating even trivial or unimportant things, while the translation suggests appreciating common yet important things, losing the original's nuance about finding value in the mundane and overlooked.","The original French 'Si on ne vouloit que des plaisirs vifs' (If one/we only wanted intense/lively pleasures) discusses the *type* of pleasure sought. The English translation changes this to 'If we shou'd look after no other Pleasure or Satisfaction, than this World afforded,' shifting the focus to the *source* of pleasure (worldly versus other). This alteration introduces a moralizing tone by implying a limitation of 'this World,' a distinction not explicit in Fontenelle's original phrase, and potentially aligning with contemporary English religious or moral sentiments.","The original French sentence is a direct, playful, and somewhat provocative question from the philosopher to the Marquise: 'You promise me then... that if one proposed to you these intense pleasures, you would remember the Tourbillons and me, and that you would limit/confine yourself to us?'. The English translation completely recasts this into a more formal, conditional statement and a wish: 'If Philosophy be the Pleasure, you propose... I have the Boldness to wish...'. Critically, the challenging and intimate concluding question 'et que vous vous borneriez à nous?' (and that you would limit/confine yourself to us?) is entirely omitted. This significantly alters the tone of the dialogue from playfully flirtatious and challenging to more reserved and formal, changing the interpersonal dynamic between the characters and softening the philosopher's directness."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">CINQUIEME SOIR.

The English translation omits this direct conclusion and instead has the philosopher end by posing a question about fixed stars being centers of 'Tourbillions'. This alters the dialogic flow, preempts the Marquise's own deduction in the following French paragraph, and changes how the concept of multiple solar systems is introduced.","The translator adds the phrase 'of the Celestial Substance, I spoke of before'. This phrase, referencing a purported earlier discussion of 'Celestial Substance' (likely Cartesian subtle matter), is not present in Fontenelle's original sentence. This addition inserts a specific scientific-sounding concept and an unverified callback, potentially to clarify or elaborate, but manipulates the text by adding information.","The English translation largely omits or heavily condenses the Marquise's enthusiastic speech where she herself deduces that fixed stars are suns, each with its own vortex of planets. By attributing a similar (but less developed) idea to the philosopher earlier and then skipping her articulation, the translation significantly diminishes the Marquise's active intellectual role, which was a key feature of Fontenelle's popularization aimed at engaging women with science.","The French 'cloüées' (nailed) presents a simple, somewhat stark image of the old Ptolemaic cosmology. The English translation expands this to 'placed, as it were so many golden Nails or Studs.' The addition of 'golden' and 'Studs' is an embellishment that makes the old view seem more ornate and decorative, subtly altering the tone and the characterization of the superseded cosmology.","The French text has the Marquise ask a rhetorical question, 'ne sont-ils pas presque aneantis' ('are they not almost annihilated'), expressing a nuanced observation. The English translation changes this to a direct, declarative statement: 'you have annihilated 'em.' This shift makes the Marquise's tone more assertive and accusatory towards the philosopher, altering the original subtlety of her reflection.","The French 'avoüez que vous ne sauriez presque plus nous déméler' means 'admit that you could hardly distinguish us anymore,' focusing on perceptual indistinguishability in a vast universe. The English 'and what shall become of us' changes this to a broader, more existential question about humanity's fate or significance. The addition of 'since the Title you give to the rest agrees to this of ours?' is an explanatory gloss not in the original, further steering the reader's interpretation of the Marquise's concern.","Fontenelle's text describes general human ambition ('ardeur de s'agrandir,' 'desseins sur desseins'). The English translation significantly expands on this, adding a list of specific negative moral actions: 'circumventing, betraying, flattering, and poorly lying,' and the clause 'to grasp a part of a World they neither know nor understand.' This transforms a philosophical observation into a pointed moral critique, manipulating the original's tone and content by introducing specific vices not mentioned by Fontenelle.","In the French, the Marquise anticipates being reproached for her 'indolence' (laziness). The English translation changes this to being reproached for 'Poverty.' This substitution alters the nature of the societal criticism being deflected, shifting from a character trait (indolence) to a socio-economic condition (poverty). This subtly manipulates the reader's perception of the Marquise's social commentary. The addition of 'with vanity' further colors her response.","The philosopher's French confession 'Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau' signifies 'a little weakness for what is beautiful,' a general appreciation. The English translation narrows this to 'a kind of Weakness in Love, a kind of frailty for what is delicate and handsom.' This interpretation makes the philosopher's 'weakness' more specific to romantic love or attraction to people, whereas the original could encompass beauty in art or nature, thus altering the scope of his sentiment.","Fontenelle's philosopher states that the new cosmic perspective does not devalue 'beaux yeux, ou une belle bouche' (beautiful eyes, or a beautiful mouth), focusing on physical attributes.

This diminishes the force of the philosopher's argument, which likens the compelling nature of scientific reasoning to that of love.","The original emphasizes the intellectual surprise (\"qu'à peine le pouvez vous croire\" - you can hardly believe it) at how far logic leads. The translation shifts this to the impossibility of escape (\"that you cannot retreat\") and adds phrases like \"maugre all your Resistance\" and \"in a short time,\" changing the described psychological effect from wonder at intellectual discovery to a sense of being trapped or overcome by the argument.","The philosopher's \"Vous convenez que\" (You agree/admit that), which invites collaborative agreement, is translated into the more forceful \"You must acknowledge that.\" This subtly changes the tone from shared reasoning to a more demanding assertion, altering the dynamic of the dialogue.","The original conditional clause \"s'il n'y a rien d'ailleurs qui m'en empêche\" (if there is nothing otherwise that prevents me from it) states a condition for belief based on the absence of counter-evidence. The translation replaces this with an assertive rhetorical question, \"for where is the hindrance or difficulty?\", which challenges the listener to find an obstacle rather than stating a logical precondition. This shifts the argumentative style from conditional reasoning to a direct challenge.","The French \"efface\" (erases, blots out) accurately describes how a brighter sun makes another celestial body invisible through its superior light. The translation \"removes and darkens\" is misleading; \"removes\" suggests physical displacement, which is incorrect in this astronomical context, and \"darkens\" only partially captures the effect of being outshone. This subtly alters the scientific accuracy of the description.","The original uses the impersonal \"On l'attache\" (One attaches it/It is assigned), implying a human intellectual act of classifying or mapping stars within constellations. The translation shifts to \"our Sun appears to the Inhabitants,\" changing the agent and action from a general human conceptualization of the cosmos to the passive perception by hypothetical alien beings. This subtly alters the focus from human astronomical practice to speculative alien experience.","The Marquise's original phrase is a philosophical question about objective necessity (\"Ne faut-il pas... que... different?\" - Must not... they differ?). The translation changes this into a statement of personal belief or disbelief (\"yet I cannot believe, but they differ\"). This shifts the Marquise's contribution from an intellectual inquiry about the nature of worlds to a more subjective opinion, altering her role in the philosophical dialogue.","The original phrase, supporting the Marquise's question about differences between worlds, is part of that interrogative structure (\"...car un fond de ressemblance ne laisse de porter des differences infinies?\" - ...for does not a foundation of resemblance nevertheless carry infinite differences?). The translation turns this into a declarative assertion (\"...for likeness upon the main does not hinder infinite little differences.\"). Furthermore, \"differences infinies\" (infinite differences) is rendered as \"infinite little differences,\" the addition of \"little\" diminishing the potential scale or significance of these variations, subtly downplaying the diversity Fontenelle suggests."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">mais la difficulté est de deviner.</span></span> Que say-je? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Un Tourbillon a plus de Planetes qui tournent autour de son Soleil</span></span>, un autre en a moins.

The English translation alters this to planets \"turning round it,\" where \"it\" contextually refers to the \"Tourbillion\" (vortex) itself. This misrepresents the Cartesian-based cosmological model Fontenelle is describing (where planets orbit a central sun *within* a vortex), thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the fundamental astronomical mechanics being discussed.","The French phrase \"un petit peloton\" translates to a small ball, cluster, or tight group, describing a purely physical aggregation. The English translation \"a little Party\" introduces a social metaphor, suggesting an organized, almost animate gathering. This changes the imagery from a physical arrangement to one with socio-anthropomorphic connotations, subtly shifting the reader's perception of these planetary systems.","The French \"l'équilibre\" refers to a general state of balance or equilibrium. The English translation \"the Counterpoise\" introduces a specific mechanical concept (a counterweight or a balancing force acting in opposition). This specifies the mechanism more narrowly than the original, suggesting a more defined, almost clockwork system. This addition of specificity narrows the interpretative scope of Fontenelle's more general term and manipulates the reader's understanding by implying a more concrete mechanical explanation than the original text offered."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P093: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Ce n'en est guere, répondit-elle, pour la quantité des Mondes.</span></span> Ce que vous dites ne suffit que pour cinq ou six, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">&amp; j'en voy d'icy des milliers?</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P065: No, said she, not for the quantity of Worlds which you say there is: What you have describ'd will suffice but for five or six, and I see thousands.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P065: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">No, said she, not for the quantity of Worlds which you say there is:</span></span> What you have describ'd will suffice but for five or six, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">and I see thousands.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French \"Ce n'en est guere\" expresses insufficiency gently (akin to \"That's hardly enough\" or \"That's not much\"). The translation's opening \"No\" is more direct and potentially more abrupt. More significantly, the original phrase \"pour la quantité des Mondes\" (for the quantity of Worlds) is translated as \"not for the quantity of Worlds which you say there is\". The addition of the clause \"which you say there is\" subtly alters the premise of the Marquise's statement. In Fontenelle's text, the Marquise contrasts the philosopher's preceding limited account (implicitly, of the few known planets) with the vast number of potential worlds she herself infers from observing thousands of stars. The translation, by adding \"which you say there is,\" reframes her point as a response to a quantity that the philosopher had supposedly already asserted himself. This shifts the reader's perception of the dialogue's dynamic, specifically regarding who is introducing the concept of this vast plurality at this specific moment and the nature of the Marquise's intellectual contribution.","The original French phrase \"& j'en voy d'icy des milliers?\" concludes with a question mark. This punctuation indicates an interrogative mood, suggesting a tone of wonder, polite challenge, inquiry, or seeking confirmation or further elaboration from the philosopher. The English translation \"and I see thousands.\" renders this as a simple declarative statement. This change removes the original nuance of questioning or amazement, making the Marquise's utterance sound more like a flat assertion rather than an inquisitive observation or a prompt for discussion.

Fontenelle later introduces the concept of an infinite number (\"un nombre infiny\") when discussing telescope discoveries. By translating \"bien d'autres\" as \"infinitely more,\" the translator prematurely escalates the magnitude of the claim, altering Fontenelle's more gradual rhetorical buildup and potentially manipulating the reader's perception of the initial statement's scale.","The French \"autant que\" means \"as many as,\" indicating an equality in quantity. The translation to \"more than\" changes this comparison to imply a superiority in number. Fontenelle's original statement is that a single constellation, viewed with a telescope, reveals a number of stars equal to what was previously seen in the entire sky with the naked eye. The translation's alteration to \"more than\" heightens this already remarkable claim, subtly changing the precision of Fontenelle's comparison and exaggerating the finding.","The French word \"peut-être\" (perhaps) introduces a degree of approximation or suggests an illustrative example for the count \"douze ou quinze\" (twelve or fifteen). The English translation omits \"perhaps\" and renders the phrase as \"where we counted but twelve or fifteen fixed Stars.\" This omission removes the conditional or estimated nature of the original count, presenting it as a more definitive or factual statement.

Its omission in the English translation removes this nuance of modesty and caution. This makes the narrator's tone slightly more assertive or less reflective about his choice of words, subtly manipulating the reader's perception of his style and the nature of his discourse.","The French \"cette Fourmiliere d'Astres\" (this anthill of Stars) uses a clear metaphor to describe the dense appearance of stars in the Milky Way. The English translation \"this Anthill or Stars\" is a mistranslation that renders the metaphor nonsensical or ambiguous (an anthill OR stars, rather than an anthill OF stars). This error alters the meaning by obscuring Fontenelle's vivid imagery, manipulating the reader's ability to clearly understand the astronomical description.","The French phrase \"il me semble que\" (it seems to me that) explicitly frames the subsequent idea of inter-world communication as the philosopher's personal speculation (\"it seems to me that from one World to another one could speak...\"). This qualifying phrase is omitted in the English translation. The target text's \"may converse\" presents the notion as a more direct possibility without the philosopher's explicit note of conjecture. This omission changes the tone from one of cautious, personal thought to greater assertiveness, subtly altering the reader's perception of the philosopher's certainty.","The translation fundamentally misrepresents Fontenelle's argument. The French states that these small worlds of the Milky Way are *apparently an exception* to a general rule (\"Ces petits Mondes sortent apparemment de la regle generale, par laquelle...\"). The English translation omits this crucial introductory idea of an exception. Furthermore, it mistranslates \"efface\" (obscures, blots out, erases) as \"faceth\" (confronts). This dual error manipulates the reader's understanding by altering the scientific reasoning presented for why these worlds would have perpetual light, changing an explanation based on an exception into a confusing and incorrect statement of a general rule.","The French \"les Gens de ces Mondes-là\" (literally, the People of those Worlds-there – plural) clearly refers to the inhabitants of the *many* small worlds within the Milky Way, consistent with the preceding discussion of the Milky Way as a \"Fourmiliere d'Astres\" (anthill of stars). The translation's \"The Inhabitants of this World\" (singular) drastically narrows this scope. This manipulation reduces the grandeur of Fontenelle's vision from a collective experience across a multitude of worlds to an ambiguous singular case, thereby shifting the reader's perception of the scale and nature of the cosmic speculation.","The French \"malheureux\" (unfortunate ones/people) is a general term for those experiencing hardship or an unfavorable condition. The English translation escalates this to \"People... under the Tribulation of dismal, real Nights.\" The introduction of \"Tribulation,\" a word with strong connotations of severe suffering, profound distress, or even divinely ordained trial (particularly resonant in the English religious and political context of the 1680s), significantly changes the tone. It shifts the description from simple misfortune to a state of profound, almost apocalyptic suffering, thereby manipulating the reader's emotional and potentially theological interpretation of the condition of having night, an intensity not as heavily emphasized in the original French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P096: Je ne vous demande pas, dit la Marquise, s'il y a des Lunes dans <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">les Mondes de la Voie de Lait</span></span>; je voy bien qu'elles n'y seroient de nul usage aux Planetes principales qui n'ont point de nuit, &amp; qui d'ailleurs marchent dans des espaces trop étroits pour s'embarrasser de cet attirail de Planetes subalternes.

Translating to the singular 'the World of the Milky Way' downplays this specific plurality, a core theme of Fontenelle's work, by suggesting the Milky Way is a single region rather than a collection of distinct 'worlds'.","The translation adds 'to my Fancy,' reframing the Marquise's 'veritable difficulté' (real difficulty) as primarily imaginative. The further addition 'which, I doubt, you will hardly satisfy:' injects a skeptical, challenging tone absent in the French, where she simply notes the difficulty. This alters her perceived character and the dialogue's dynamic.","The original French 'n'est-il pas vray?' (isn't that true?) shows the Marquise seeking confirmation for her premise. The English translation omits this interrogative phrase, transforming her statement into a direct assertion ('all the Tourbillions are round,').

The translation expands this to \"Nature, who will lose nothing, and turns all her work to the best advantage.\" The latter part, \"and turns all her work to the best advantage,\" is an addition that makes Nature's actions sound more explicitly teleological and deliberately optimizing. This subtly shifts the perception from simple efficiency to a more pronounced, purposeful design, potentially aligning it more with contemporary English theological views of natural order.","The original French, \"& ne laissent pas d'être un ou deux, ou mille Mondes de plus,\" asserts that these small tourbillons *are* indeed additional worlds ('do not fail to be/are nonetheless... Worlds'). The translation, \"and yet every one of these may have a World in it;\", changes this direct identification to a possibility (\"may have\") and a relationship of containment (a tourbillon *contains* a world) rather than identity. This significantly weakens Fontenelle's clear assertion about the nature of these other worlds, making the idea less direct and more speculative for the reader.","Fontenelle's French \"s'ajustent les uns avec les autres le mieux qu'il est possible\" (adjust to one another as best as possible) describes a functional, optimal arrangement of tourbillons. The English translation renders this as \"are so rightly adjusted, and join'd to one another in so delicate a Form.\" The addition of \"in so delicate a Form\" introduces an aesthetic judgment and a quality of intricate craftsmanship not explicitly present in Fontenelle's more straightforward mechanical description. This subtly manipulates the reader's perception by embellishing the original and suggesting a more artful or divinely designed universe.","The French \"Ils s'engrainent en quelque façon les uns dans les autres\" means that the tourbillons mesh or interlock with each other, like gears, implying a dynamic interaction crucial to Cartesian vortex theory. The translation \"They are fixed to one another\" suggests a static, unmoving connection. This is a significant mistranslation that fundamentally alters the mechanical analogy Fontenelle uses to explain the interaction of cosmic systems, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the scientific model being presented.","Fontenelle's French \"& on pretendent que les Etoiles Fixes\" uses the indefinite pronoun \"on\" (it is claimed/people claim/some claim that), leaving the source of the assertion about fixed stars general and unspecified. The English translation changes this to \"And the Philosophers pretend, that the fixed Stars.\" This specification attributes the claim to a distinct group (\"Philosophers\"), thereby altering the framing of the idea. It could lend the idea a specific intellectual authority or, conversely (given the potential contemporary connotations of \"pretend\" and the specific identification), mark it as a specialized or perhaps contentious tenet of natural philosophers, rather than a more diffuse speculation as in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">J'aime fort</s<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">pan></span> toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

The English translation `I am extreamly in love` uses more effusive and potentially sentimental phrasing. For a 17th-century female character discussing science, this subtly shifts the tone, potentially portraying her engagement as more based on ardent emotion than purely intellectual appreciation, affecting the reader's perception of her character.","The French `se desenflent` means 'deflate' or 'unswell,' describing the balloons losing air or volume. The English translation `fall` describes the consequence of deflation (losing buoyancy and moving downwards) rather than the act of deflation itself. This alters the described physical mechanics of the 'Balloons,' shifting focus from their intrinsic change of state to their resulting movement.","The French `ces Mondes qui se combattent toûjours` (these Worlds which always fight/combat each other) depicts a constant, vigorous, and potentially antagonistic interaction. The English translation `those Worlds, which are always justling together` significantly softens this image to one of mere bumping or crowding, which is less intense and lacks the implication of active conflict. This manipulation alters the reader's perception of the dynamic and energetic nature of the cosmos as presented by Fontenelle, toning down its inherent drama.","The original French presents two distinct statements from the Marquise: a general appreciation for 'all those ideas' (`J'aime fort toutes ces Idées-là`), separated by 'dit la Marquise.', from her liking for specific subsequent examples (`J'aime ces Ballons...`). The translation merges these into a single, continuous statement where her 'love' is for 'ideas you give me *of the Balloons*'. This restructuring, along with the addition of 'you give me,' narrows the scope of her appreciation from general concepts to specific examples directly attributed to the philosopher.

Replacing \"les enfants\" (the children) with \"those Ignorants\" and adding \"I confess\" further strengthens the judgmental tone and alters the philosopher's original statement.","The French phrase \"à cause de leur équipage extraordinaire\" (because of their extraordinary appearance/retinue), which provides the reason for fear, is omitted. It should appear after \"repliquay-je\" (said I), but the translation proceeds from \"Madam, said I;\" directly to \"but of those Ignorants...\", removing the stated cause.","The omission of \"peut-être\" (perhaps/maybe) from the description of the tourbillon (\"ce Tourbillon êtant peut-être differemment pressé\") makes the scientific explanation in \"But this Tourbillion being press'd\" sound more definitive and less speculative than Fontenelle's original phrasing.","The original \"comme écrasé\" (as if crushed/flattened) is translated as \"as it were, braz'd or squeez'd\". While \"squeez'd\" is appropriate, the inclusion of \"braz'd\" (which implies being soldered or made of brass) is a misinterpretation that introduces an incorrect physical property for the tourbillon.","The original French \"& c'est par en-bas qu'il nous regarde\" means \"and it's from below that it [the Vortex] faces us.\" The translation \"and it is from below that they appear to us\" changes the subject from \"il\" (the Vortex) to \"they\" (the Comets) and the verb from an action of the vortex (\"regarde\" - faces) to the comets' mode of appearance, subtly altering the physical description.","The philosopher's expression of a personal hypothesis \"que je suppose qui est le nôtre\" (which I suppose is ours) is translated as \"which happens sometimes to be ours.\" This changes a speculative supposition into a statement of occasional fact, removing the personal, conjectural nuance from the speaker's assertion.","The original \"Aussi sont-elles toûjours fort élevées... elles marchent beaucoup au dessus de Saturne\" (Thus they are always very high... they travel much above Saturn) is altered. \"Sont-elles toûjours fort élevées\" becomes \"They all appear to us highly elevated,\" shifting from a statement of being (\"sont\"/are) to one of perception (\"appear\"). Furthermore, \"beaucoup au dessus\" (much above) is intensified to \"constantly above Saturn,\" making the assertion more absolute.","The entire final and significant portion of Fontenelle's paragraph, beginning with \"Il est nécessaire dans nôtre Sistême...\", is omitted in the translation. The provided target text ends with \"their Course being constantly above Saturn.\", leaving out Fontenelle's crucial discussion on a criticized aspect of the vortex theory (the \"empty space\") and his witty explanation for its utility.

The English translation entirely discards this conversational setup and the initial premise of the analogy. Instead, it introduces a completely new assertion about a 'great vast space betwixt Saturn, and the Extremities of our Tourbillion' being 'necessary for the Defence of our System.' This substitution changes the topic from an explanation of cosmic interaction via analogy to a defensive justification of a specific feature of the solar system's structure. The added phrase '(for Reasons that do not at all relate to our present Subject)' further distances the text from Fontenelle's fluid dialogic style, adding an editor-like, almost dismissive, meta-commentary not present in the original, thus manipulating the reader's understanding of the content and style.","Fontenelle's text continues the Ottoman analogy, specifying that ambassadors (representing external celestial bodies) are lodged in 'un Fauxbourg de la Ville' (a Suburb of the City), emphasizing their peripheral status and preventing them from reaching the 'heart' of the system. The English translation omits this crucial detail of the analogy and instead inserts a polemical discourse about 'Our Adversaries' who 'reproach us with the unusefulness of this great Void.' This addition introduces a confrontational tone and a debate ('reproach', 'unusefulness') entirely absent from Fontenelle's original passage. This manipulation shifts the focus from a descriptive analogy to a defensive argument, potentially reflecting contemporary English polemical contexts or the translator's intent to frame scientific ideas within a contentious environment, misrepresenting Fontenelle's purpose and altering the reader's perception of the work's character.","The French text concludes the analogy by highlighting a shared characteristic with the Ottomans: receiving ambassadors without sending any in return, and similarly, 'nous ne renvoyons point de nos Planetes aux Mondes voisins' (we don't send any of our Planets to neighboring Worlds). This point about non-reciprocity and the distinct, perhaps privileged or protected, status of 'our' planets is significant. The English translation omits this entire idea of non-reciprocal relations and the specific Ottoman comparison. Instead, it repurposes the 'Ambassadors' theme by designating the previously mentioned 'great Void' as 'the Appartment, or Chambers of State, where we receive the Stranger Planetary Ambassadors.' This transforms the original's nuanced point about containment and one-way interaction (lodging in suburbs, no return envoys) into a grand, formal reception for 'Stranger Planetary Ambassadors' in a designated 'Chambers of State.' This alteration gives a very different, more dignified and less exclusionary impression of the interaction, omits Fontenelle's observation about the solar system's self-contained nature in this context, and thus manipulates the reader's understanding of the original philosophical point."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P102: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">A en juger par toutes ces choses là, répliqua-t-elle,. nous sommes bien fiers.</span></span> Cependant je ne sais pas trop encore ce que j'en dois croire.

Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles Fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumière; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; car que faire sans Soleil?

Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion-là, qui est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">plus douce que l'autre</span></span>, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoître, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mêmes? Vous êtes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">en votre faveur.</span></span> Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles Fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantôt plus grandes tantôt plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus légers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur. Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement, des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoîtroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoître de longtemps. Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa</span></span>, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer</span></span> que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose</span></span>, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre.</span></span> Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"11\">il faut que l'espce se repare.</span></span> Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"12\">que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë.</span></span> Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, répliquai-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au-delà, il faudroit être plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous.

Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or false Light. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light? The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, and then farewell the Sun and all its Light. 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect. The Ancients were <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">foolish </span></span> to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience; but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener, but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is: Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever, yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? Eternity is not so easy a matter; and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish. Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them. If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other. Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie. 'Tis sufficient for me to have carried your Understanding as far as your sight can penetrate.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P074: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">I understand you, said she, and am pleas'd with your Chamber of State; for we do not permit 'em to come directly in the middle of our Tourbillion, but receive 'em as the Grand Seignior does his Foreign Ministers; he does 'em not the Honour to lodge 'em in Constantinople, but sends 'em to the Suburbs. Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud</span></span>, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">to terrifie us</span></span>; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or false Light.</span></span> I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air:</span></span> As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Is there no way to pass it by?</span></span> If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">more favourable than the other</span></span>; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">for your Satisfaction,</span></span> I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light?

'Tis sufficient for me to have carried your Understanding as far as your sight can penetrate.</p>","explanations":["The English translation prefaces the Marquise's statement (which begins with 'At this rate...') with a lengthy, entirely new dialogue not found in the French source. This added section introduces an elaborate political and diplomatic metaphor involving a 'Chamber of State,' the 'Grand Seignior,' 'Turks,' and 'Ambassadors.' This addition significantly alters the opening of this exchange, imposing a specific geopolitical framing and tone absent in Fontenelle's original, thereby manipulating the reader's perception by adding an unrelated analogy.","The original French 'pour nous insulter' (to insult us) is translated as 'to terrifie us.' This changes the perceived intent of the comets from one of causing an affront or disrespect to one of instilling fear, altering the nuance of the Marquise's concern and the characterization of the 'stranger-planets'.","The French 'on la devinera quand on pourra' (it will be figured out when possible) is a neutral statement about future understanding. The English translation expands this to 'But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or false Light.' The addition of 'or false Light' introduces a specific, potentially pejorative interpretation of the 'illumination' that is not explicit in the original, subtly coloring the phenomenon as possibly deceptive.","The French 'Rien n'est si divertissant' (Nothing is so entertaining/amusing) is translated as 'nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air.' This substitution changes the Marquise's stated motivation for appreciating the comets' travel from seeking amusement or diversion to seeking health benefits, altering the tone and her reasoning.","The original French 'N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner?' means 'Wouldn't there be a way to spare me that [idea]?', implying a desire to be shielded from a distressing thought. The translation 'Is there no way to pass it by?' suggests a more superficial desire to simply change the subject or ignore the idea, subtly lessening the depicted emotional impact of the 'funeste' idea on the Marquise.","The French 'plus douce' (gentler, softer, milder) describing an alternative opinion is translated as 'more favourable.' This shifts the philosopher's stated reason for considering the opinion from it being emotionally gentler for the Marquise to it being merely more 'favourable,' which can imply intellectually convenient rather than emotionally comforting, subtly altering the perceived motivation behind his choice of explanation.","The phrase 'en votre faveur' (in your favour/for your sake) is translated as 'for your Satisfaction.' While related, 'en votre faveur' implies a more personal gesture of goodwill or gallantry. 'For your satisfaction' can sound more like addressing an intellectual query or fulfilling a demand, subtly shifting the tone of the philosopher's concession from personal consideration to a more formal response.","The French 'la force du Soleil' (the strength/force of the Sun) describes a physical power responsible for breaking the crust. The translation 'the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it' personifies the sun, attributing the action to its 'face' rather than its inherent power. This introduces a more metaphorical and less scientific image, subtly altering the nature of the cosmological explanation.","The French 'Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer' (The Ancients were amusing/quaint to imagine) conveys a sense of gentle irony or mild condescension. Translating this as 'The Ancients were foolish to imagine' makes the judgment harsher and more direct, altering the philosopher's tone from subtly dismissive to overtly critical of the Ancients' understanding.","The French 'de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose' (after more than fifteen thousand rose-ages) indicates a quantity exceeding fifteen thousand. The translation 'after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses' omits 'more than' ('de plus de'), changing an indefinite large number to a specific one. This subtly reduces the implied vastness and imprecise nature of the timescale in the analogy.","The Marquise's original statement 'Vrayment... je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre' (Truly... I see the Worlds are far from being able to claim [eternity/immortality]) is a direct observation. The translation 'I am not so unreasonable... as to consider the Worlds as things eternal' reframes her statement as a defense of her own reasonableness, subtly shifting her tone from one of dawning realization to one of self-justification.","The French 'il faut que l'espce se repare' (the species must renew/repair itself) is a concise statement about renewal. The English translation expands this to 'and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish.' The addition 'and no Species can totally perish' introduces a stronger, more explicit philosophical claim about the absolute indestructibility of species that is not present in the original, potentially guiding the reader towards a more fixed and optimistic view of nature's processes.","The French 'que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë.' signifies that the Marquise has completely changed her mind about a previous notion (i.e., she is disabused of it). The English 'that I am altogether returned to my self.' is ambiguous; it can imply regaining composure rather than specifically conveying a disillusionment or a fundamental shift in her understanding of the cosmos. This softens the portrayal of her intellectual transformation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la tête <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">tout le systeme de l'Univers</span></span>! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Je suis savante!</span></span> Oüy, répliquay-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">vous l'êtes assez raisonnablement</span></span>, &amp; vous l'êtes avec la commodité de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra.

The translation to \"the Systemes of all the Universe\" (plural) subtly alters this by suggesting multiple systems, potentially diminishing the impact and definitiveness of the specific revolutionary worldview being presented and which the Marquise has just grasped.","The Marquise's original French exclamation \"Je suis savante!\" (\"I am knowledgeable!\" or \"I am learned!\") expresses a confident realization of her newfound understanding. The translation changes this into a question, \"am I become so learned?\", which significantly alters the tone from assertion to one of surprise or uncertainty. This subtly diminishes the Marquise's empowered intellectual agency, a key aspect of Fontenelle's progressive portrayal of a woman engaging with science.","The philosopher's original affirmation, \"vous l'êtes assez raisonnablement\" (meaning \"you are [learned] quite reasonably\" or \"to a reasonable degree\"), conveys a nuanced approval of the Marquise's understanding. The translation \"you know enough\" is more blunt and can carry a limiting or even slightly patronizing connotation, implying she has merely met a basic threshold rather than achieved a commendable level of reasoned knowledge. This subtly alters the perceived nature of the philosopher's encouragement.","The original French lists \"le Soleil, ny le Ciel, ny les Etoiles\" (the Sun, nor the Sky/Heaven, nor the Stars) as celestial objects the Marquise should associate with the philosopher. The translation changes this to \"the Heavens, Sun, Moon or Stars,\" notably adding \"Moon.\" While the Moon is a central topic in the book's discussion of other worlds, its explicit insertion here is an addition of information not present in Fontenelle's original formulation of this sentimental request. This shifts the reader's perception by making the list more exhaustive of specific astronomical bodies discussed, subtly altering the poetic and general scope of the original phrase."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">FIN</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P076: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P076: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">FINIS.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French original uses 'FIN', a simple, vernacular term meaning 'THE END', consistent with Fontenelle's project of writing in accessible French to popularize science. The translation's use of 'FINIS.', a Latin term (albeit a common convention for concluding English books of the period), subtly manipulates the tone. It imbues the work's conclusion with a more formal, classical, and scholarly connotation than the original's simple French ending. This stylistic choice subtly shifts the register away from the direct vernacular simplicity Fontenelle employed, potentially giving the work's conclusion a slightly more traditional or learned feel that contrasts with the author's innovative popularizing intent."]}],"counts":{"manual":30,"ai":380}}
