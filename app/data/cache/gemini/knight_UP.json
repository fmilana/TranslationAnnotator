Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune estoit levée il y avoit Page 8] peut-estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moyndre Etoile; elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné.</span></span> Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Helas, repliquay-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer</span></span>; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien e</span></span>stre un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.</span></span> Et bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">donnez-la-moy</span></span>, je croiray sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison?</span></span> Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles.

I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self. Well, says she, since your Folly is so delightful, pray let me have a share in it, I'l believe what you please of the Stars, provided I find pleasure in it. Ah! Madam, said I, 'tis not a pleasure like that which you find in a Comedy of Moliere; 'tis a pleasure, I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind. And pray, says she, do you think me incapable of pleasures that are only in the Reason; bring me acquainted with your Stars, and you shall presently see the contrary. No, said I, it shall never be laid to my charge, that in a Grove, at ten of clock at night, I entertain'd the most lovely person in the World with nothing but Philosophy, look out for such Philosophers elsewhere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day.

Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne sçavois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle qui ne sçavoit rien en matiere de Phisique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit estre une Planete; &amp; les Planetes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des Mondes. J'en revenois toûjours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en nostre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes; &amp; si d'un autre costé vous étiez moins curieuse, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le sçavoir</span></span>, ce qui reviendrait au mesme. Mais on veut sçavoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est-là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est.</span></span> Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera. Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">qui s'inquiete d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté.</span></span> Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées</span></span>, &amp; elles le sont si bien, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers</span></span>; car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyoient <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent,</span></span> qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre</span></span>; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; cent autres resveries,</span></span> que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique? Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties. Avoüez la verité. N'avez-vous point eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne meritoit? J'ay vû des gens qui l'en estimoyent moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoyent connu. Et moy, repliqua-t-elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sçay qu'il ressemble à une Montre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples.</span></span> </p><p>P005: Je ne sçay pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">mais en verité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la teste <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">un faux Merveilleux</span></span> envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent.</span></span> Ils n'admirent la Nature que parce qu'ils la croyent une espece de Magie où l'on n'entend rien, &amp; il est seur qu'une chose est deshonorée auprés d'eux, dés qu'elle peut estre conceüe. Mais, Madame, continuay-je, vous estes si bien disposée à entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire, que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, &amp; à vous montrer le Monde.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret.

Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are;</span></span> so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it,</span></span> and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe</span></span>: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind,</span></span> and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre</span></span>, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">and a thousand other extravagancies</span></span>, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple.</span></span> I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">but I assure you they are not common;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">a false kind of Wonder</span></span> involv'd in Clouds which they respect;</span></span> they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</p>","explanations":["The translator added the colloquial English phrase \"two pence\" to the expression of not caring, intensifying it in a culturally specific way for the English audience.","The translator added the introductory phrase \"the mischief is,\" an idiomatic expression in English, to emphasize the problematic nature of human perception, adding a colloquial tone not present in the simple French conjunction \"mais\".","The translator used the vivid English idiom \"beat his brains\" to replace the more literal French \"s'inquiète\" (concerns himself/worries), elaborating on the intensity of the machinist's mental effort to make it more relatable.","The translator added the doublet \"wholly and entirely\" to intensify \"abscond\" (hidden), an emphatic rendering of the French \"parfaitement bien cachées\" (perfectly well hidden).","The translator elaborated on \"long-temps à deviner\" (a long time to guess/figure out) with \"the study of many days to resolve,\" specifying the nature of the prolonged effort as one of dedicated, formal investigation.","The translator replaced the simpler French clause \"que les Vents enlevent\" (that the winds carry away) with the more poetic and elaborate English phrase \"born upon the Wings of the Wind,\" adding a layer of literary imagery.","The translator added the word \"natural\" to \"Propensity\" (which translates \"amitié\" - friendship/liking), giving a more formal, quasi-scientific, and inherent quality to Phaeton's supposed inclination.","The translator changed \"cent\" (a hundred) in \"& cent autres resveries,\" (and a hundred other daydreams/fantasies) to \"a thousand\" in \"and a thousand other extravagancies\", a common English hyperbole for 'many,' to rhetorically amplify the number of flawed ideas.","The translator added \"a thing to me\" to \"most surprizing.\" While \"Il est surprenant\" means \"It is surprising,\" the addition of \"a thing\" makes the statement slightly more concrete, and \"to me\" explicitly personalizes the surprise expressed by the Marquise.","The translator replaced the impersonal French \"en verité\" (in truth) with the more direct personal assurance \"I assure you,\" aiming to increase engagement with the English reader.","The translator rendered \"Assez de Gens ont toûjours\" (Many people always have) as \"We shall daily meet with people.\" The addition of \"daily\" and the shift in phrasing intensifies the idea, suggesting a more frequent and inevitable encounter.","The translator added \"kind of\" to the phrase \"a false Wonder\" (translating \"un faux Merveilleux\").

La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus interessée que je ne l'ay, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne, &amp; nous y menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraye vie pastorale que de parler des Planetes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaist, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes.</span></span></span></span> Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien.</span></span> Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoyent esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pieces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">où elle s'estoit placée</span></span>, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué</span></span>, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvemens qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile;</span></span> aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Et la Lune?</span></span> vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je.</span></span> La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars.</span></span></span></span> The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing.</span></span> But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">where it had long been fixt</span></span>, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road.

This makes the philosopher's account of the King's supposed advice more specific and definitive than in the original French text.","The translator replaces the source's introductory phrase \"Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de\" (Apparently, they [the pieces of advice] also concerned that of...) with \"'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of\". This alteration significantly increases the expressed certainty (from 'apparently' to 'most certain') and changes the agent from the advice itself to the King ('he meant'), thus adding a layer of definitiveness and personal intention not explicitly present in the source.","The translator adds the phrase \"in those days\" to the target text. This addition provides specific temporal context, emphasizing that the practice of inventing crystal heavens was characteristic of a past era, a clarification not explicitly stated in the source.","The source phrase \"où elle s'estoit placée\" translates to \"where it had placed itself\" or \"where it was located.\" The translator renders this as \"where it had long been fixt,\" adding the adverb \"long\" (indicating duration) and the adjective \"fixt\" (indicating immobility). These descriptive details are not explicit in the French and are added to provide a clearer, more embellished image of Earth's previous status in the old cosmological model.","The translator inserts the adjective \"idle\" into the phrase describing Earth's rest (\"her long idle repose\"). The source simply states \"long repos\" (long rest). The addition of \"idle\" emphasizes the Earth's inactivity and adds a slightly pejorative or moralistic connotation that aligns with the subsequent idea of Earth being \"chastised\" for this repose.","The translator inserts the phrase \", you say,\" into the Marquise's statement as she recapitulates the philosopher's explanation. In the source, the Marquise states her understanding directly (\"Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, & là il est immobile;\"). The addition of \", you say,\" reframes her utterance, making it clear that she is recalling or verifying what the philosopher has just told her, thus making her conversational turn more explicit as a check of understanding.","The Marquise's elliptical French question \"Et la Lune?\" (And the Moon?) is expanded by the translator into the more complete English question \"And what, says she, becomes of the Moon?\". This addition of \"what... becomes of\" provides explicitness, making the Marquise's inquiry clearer and more natural in English dialogue than a literal translation might have been.","The French adverb \"bien\" in \"Je la retrouveray bien\" can convey certainty, thoroughness, or ease (e.g., \"I'll indeed find her again\" or \"I'll find her again alright/easily\"). The translator chooses to make the nuance of ease explicit by adding \"easy enough\" at the end of the clause. This addition clarifies the philosopher's confident and untroubled tone regarding the Moon's place in the new system."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient.

The French \"le but\" (the goal/aim) is rendered as \"the end,\" and \"of its course\" is an elaboration specifying that this \"end\" refers to the completion of the bowl's trajectory, thus clarifying the analogy for the English reader.","Within this target segment, the translator framed the core translation \"pure imagination\" (from \"Imagination pure\") with the English emphatic construction \"Nothing else...but.\" The specific added words are \"Nothing else,\" (appearing at the beginning of the philosopher's reply) and \"but\" (placed before \"pure imagination\"), which serve to intensify the assertion that the phenomenon is solely imagination.","The translator added the clause \"She is not easily movable\" at the beginning of this target sentence. This phrase effectively replaces a direct translation of the French \"on ne l'a guere ménagée\" (which means \"it has hardly been spared\" or \"one has not treated it gently\").

The target 'This and all the other Cod of the Silkworm turns' separates 'This' (the Earth-cocoon) from 'all the other Cod of the Silkworm' (literal cocoons). The phrase 'and all the other' is added to introduce these literal cocoons, extending the comparison beyond what the source explicitly states.","The translator added 'as we do' to the phrase 'make such a noise on all hands'. This addition personalizes the 'grande agitation' (great agitation/noise) by explicitly attributing it to human agency ('we'), whereas the source text uses an impersonal construction 'il regne... une si grande agitation' (there reigns... a great agitation).","The translator added 'or other' to the phrase 'some little mark'. This addition makes the Marquise's question more colloquial and informal in English, suggesting any kind of mark rather than a specific one, fitting a conversational style.","The translator added 'it self' after 'Morality' for emphasis. This intensifier strengthens the assertion that the principle (about natural motions being least perceived) extends even to the domain of morality, a common emphatic device in English.","The translator added 'at all' to the phrase 'we are not at all sensible of it'. This intensifies the negation in 'nous ne le sentons pas' (we do not feel it/are not sensible of it), emphasizing the complete lack of awareness regarding the motion of self-love. It's a common English intensifier.","The translator added 'now' to the phrase 'Let us retire'. This addition provides a common temporal adverb that specifies the immediacy of the action, making the Marquise's suggestion 'Retirons-nous' (Let us retire) more explicit and natural in English conversational flow."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">En retournant au Château je luy dis pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes, qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Ticho- Brahé</<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">span></span> qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fust immobile, la plaçoit au centre du Monde</span></span>, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planetes, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planetes autour de la Terre.

The English phrase introduces the concepts of 'carrying on' (continuing an activity) and 'business' (in the sense of affairs or dealings), which are not present in the source's notion of 'exhausting the subject.' This addition alters the narrator's stated purpose from definitively concluding the topic to continuing an ongoing discussion or activity related to systems, possibly to make the phrasing more idiomatic or conversational in English.","The source text describes Tycho Brahe as 'voulant absolument que la Terre fust immobile' (literally 'absolutely wanting/wishing the Earth to be immobile' or 'insisting absolutely that the Earth be immobile'). The translator renders this part as 'being absolutely of opinion that the Earth was immovable.' The phrase 'of opinion' is an addition that elaborates on Brahe's stance. It specifies that his strong desire or insistence ('voulant absolument') was rooted in a firmly held belief or viewpoint, thus clarifying his motivation as a matter of conviction, a nuance not explicitly stated in the original French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: SECOND SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P014: THE Second Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P014: THE Second Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P021: Le lendemain au matin dés que l'on pût entrer dans l'Appartement de la Marquise, j'envoyay sçavoir de ses nouvelles, &amp; luy demander si elle avoit pû dormir en tournant.

While the French 'Voilà dans l'obligation' conveys a sense of being compelled, 'downright' makes the obligation more absolute and emphatic for the English reader, possibly for naturalness or stronger impact in English.","The translator added 'half' to qualify the Marquise's fear. The French 'me fait déjà peur' translates to 'already makes me afraid' or 'is already scaring me.' The addition of 'half' specifies the intensity of the fear, making it less total and perhaps adding a nuance of apprehension rather than full-blown fear, potentially for naturalness or to soften the Marquise's reaction.","The French phrase 'dont je ne me fusse jamais doutée' expresses past incredulity or that she would never have suspected such a thing. The translator replaced this with the phrase 'of which I shall never make any doubt,' which introduces a new proposition: a future-oriented declaration of unwavering belief. This element of future conviction is an addition not present in the source text's reflection on past surprise or ignorance, possibly to make the Marquise's conversion to the new ideas seem more decisive for the target audience.","The translator added 'likewise' to make the parallel more explicit. The French 'aussi' (also, too) implies similarity. The word 'likewise' ('in the same way') elaborates on this, emphasizing that the Earth's action of reflecting light to the Moon is similar to the Moon's action of reflecting light to the Earth (mentioned previously in the dialogue as 'she returns it to us'), thus clarifying the analogy for the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere au Soleil?</span></span> Je vous vois toûjours pour la Lune, repris-je, un reste d'estime dont vous ne sçauriez vous défaire.

The translator added this detailed explanation of *how* this synchronous rotation results in the same face of the Moon always being visible from Earth, providing clarity on the mechanism which is absent in the source.","This sentence summarizes the consequence of the Moon's synchronous rotation concerning its apparent fixity from Earth's perspective relative to its actual rotation around its own axis. This explicit summary clarifying the Moon's complex motion is an addition by the translator.","The source text describes Earth's view of the Moon. The translator added this passage to describe the reciprocal view: what an observer on the Moon would see regarding the stars and the Earth's apparent static position. This enriches the astronomical context and is not present in the source.","This reflective commentary on the implications of Earth's apparent immobility from the Moon (and the Moon's own imperfections) is an addition by the translator, offering a philosophical aside not found in the corresponding French text.","The French source refers to \"ce tremblement\" (this trembling/wavering) without defining it or its visual effects. The translator added the Latin technical term \"(motus libratorius)\" for scientific precision and the clause \"which is the cause that a little corner of her Face is sometimes hid, and a little corner of the opposite side appears\" to explain the nature and observable consequences of this lunar motion, details absent in the source.","The French \"& de s'imaginer\" (and to imagine / and one imagines) is impersonal. The translator added \"Now I'le undertake, that she imputes that wavering to us, and\" to introduce the philosopher's direct assertion (\"I'le undertake\"), specify that the Moon or its inhabitants (\"she\") actively misattribute the libration (\"imputes that wavering to us\"), and link this to the subsequent idea of Earth's perceived motion.

The source 'un Arrest du Genre humain' translates to 'a decree of Mankind'. The addition of 'general' makes the scope of the Edict more explicit, possibly for emphasis or clarity for the English-speaking audience, specifying it as a universally binding decree.","The French source 'Il faudrait donc' translates to 'It would therefore be necessary' or 'Then it would be necessary'. The translator's phrase 'Then 'twill be likewise necessary' includes 'likewise'. This addition explicitly signals that the subsequent point (abolishing the memory of all things) is a parallel or additional consequence stemming from the same line of reasoning as the first proposed Edict, a nuance of parallel connection not directly conveyed by 'donc' alone.","The source phrase 'quelque sotise des hommes' means 'some foolishness of men' or 'any foolishness of men'. In the target text, this becomes 'the Folly of mankind'. The addition of the definite article 'The' (along with the capitalization of 'Folly') serves to elevate 'sotise' from specific instances of foolishness to a more abstract, generalized, and perhaps even personified concept of Folly as an inherent characteristic of humanity.

The French source 'que nous allassions gâter leurs Herbes,' (that we might go spoil their herbs) uses 'allassions' (go) which does not specify direction. The addition of 'down' (in the target phrase 'go down to spoil their Herbs') elaborates on the movement, suggesting a specific downward direction, presumably from Earth towards the Moon as perceived by Lunar inhabitants. This enhances the imagery and provides a more specific spatial context for the English reader.","The translator used the word 'Diseases' where the source text has 'ses Malades' (its sick people/the sick ones). The target phrase is 'give the Crises to their Diseases,' while a more direct translation of the source 'à donner des crises à ses Malades,' would be 'to give crises to its/their sick people.' The introduction of 'Diseases' as the recipient of the 'Crises' changes the focus from the afflicted individuals to their illnesses.

The translator clarifies this by rendering the full phrase as 'the more inland part of the Country'. The segment 'more inland part' is an elaboration of the French 'le dedans', specifying the nature of this 'inside' as interior geography of the Moon and possibly intensifying the description with 'more,' thus providing a clearer image for the English reader.","The concise French 'aussi-tost voila' (meaning 'immediately, there was' or 'immediately, behold') is expanded in the target text to 'they had presently at hand' when describing the chariot's appearance. This phrasing shifts the narrative from an impersonal presentation of the chariot's sudden appearance ('voila') to a more active construction focused on the characters ('they had'), suggesting the chariot was readily available for them. This elaboration makes the scene more vivid from the characters' perspective and adds a nuance of agency or provision not explicitly in the source.","The French 'un Vallon' (a valley, often implying a small one) is translated as 'a great Vale'. The adjective 'great' is an addition by the translator, as 'un Vallon' does not inherently carry this meaning of large size (it often implies the opposite). This addition enhances the description of the valley, emphasizing its significance or vastness in the lunar landscape described by Ariosto."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sçais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune.

C'est que les Papes ont prétendu estre Maistres de Rome &amp; de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, &amp; la verité est qu'on ne sçauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë.

In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it. But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd.

They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery.

However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland.

Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure.

This addition clarifies the method by which the phial is sealed, making the image more concrete and practical for the reader to understand how evaporation is prevented.","The translator added \"presently\" (meaning immediately or soon after) to describe Astolphus's action of seizing his phial. The French \"Il s'en saisit\" (He seized it) does not explicitly contain this temporal marker. The addition enhances the narrative flow by specifying the immediacy of the action.","The translator added the conjunctive adverb \"However\" at the beginning of the sentence. The French \"Il n'oublia pas\" (He did not forget) starts directly. \"However\" provides a transition from the previous sentence (about Astolphus losing his own wits again), linking the ideas with a contrastive or concessive nuance not explicitly marked by a conjunction in the source.","The translator added \"even\" before \"such as.\" The French \"tel que\" means \"such as\" or \"as.\" The addition of \"even\" intensifies the comparison, emphasizing the degree to which the speaker might become like Roland, adding a layer of dramatic emphasis not explicitly present in the French.","The translator added \"still\" to the description of the wits \"hovering.\" The French \"il va errant\" (it goes wandering/it wanders) implies continuation, but \"still\" makes this ongoing state more explicit, emphasizing that the wits continue to be near the Marchioness.","The translator changed \"des lévres\" (lips - plural, indefinite) to \"a pair of Lips.\" This specification makes the image more concrete and aligns with the common English idiom referring to lips in the context of kissing, adding a precision not explicitly in the French.","The translator added \"pray\" before \"tell me.\" The French \"dites-moy\" is a direct imperative (tell me). \"Pray\" softens this command, adding a tone of polite request or earnestness.","The translator added \"or not\" at the end of the clause. The French \"si vous croyez que...\" (if you believe that...) is a complete conditional question. Adding \"or not\" in English makes the question explicitly disjunctive (a yes/no question), a common grammatical structure for such interrogative clauses.","The translator added \"Do but\" before \"observe.\" The French \"Voyez\" is a simple imperative (See/Observe). \"Do but observe\" is an older English construction that adds a persuasive or emphatic tone to the imperative.","The translator added \"and certainly\" for emphasis and logical connection, and significantly expanded the simple prepositional phrase \"D'icy à la Lune\" (From here to the Moon) into \"in such a distance as between this and the Moon,\" making the concept of vast distance more explicit and rhetorically emphasized.","The translator added \"a sort of\" before \"Animals.\" The French \"ce sont des Animaux\" means \"they are animals.\" Adding \"a sort of\" qualifies the statement, making it less direct or perhaps suggesting a category or type, potentially to soften the classification or add nuance.","The translator added \"therefore,\" introducing an explicit logical connector to mark a conclusion from the preceding argument. The French text uses \"assurément\" (surely) for certainty, which is rendered as \"surely\" in the target text, but \"therefore\" adds a distinct element of causal linkage.","The translator added \"at all\" to the negation \"would not find them Men.\" The French \"ce ne seroient plus des Hommes\" means \"(they) would no longer be Men.\" The addition of \"at all\" makes the English negation more emphatic and absolute."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience?

Could we represent to our selves a thing in Passions so foolish and so wise in reflection, of so short a duration and so long a foresight, so much knowledge in things unprofitable and so much ignorance in the most important, so great a desire of liberty, &amp; so much inclination to Servitude; so much desire to be happy, &amp; so great an incapacity of being so? the People of the Moon must have a great deal of sense to divine all this. We see our selves daily, and yet are to seek to know how we are made. It made some say, that the Gods were full of Nectar when they made Man, and when they came to look upon their Work in a sober temper, they could not forbear laughing. </p><p>P032: Well then, said the Marchioness, I see we are secure of the people of the Moon, they'l not discover us; but <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">I should be very glad we could know them</span></span>: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">for, to tell you truth, it much disquiets me to know that they are there above</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">in that Moon that we now see</span></span>, and that we cannot at all represent to our selves how they are made. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">And why, said I, are you not concern'd too for the Inhabitants of that great Terra Australis, which is hitherto utterly unknown to us?</span></span> both they and we are carried in one Vessel, they in the Proe and we in the Poup; you see there is no Communication between the Proe and the Poup, and that at one end of the Ship 'tis not known what sort of people are in the other; yet you would know what's done in the Moon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">that other Vessel that sails in the Heavens at so great a distanee from us.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The intensifier \"very\" is added before \"glad\". The source \"je voudrais\" (I would like/wish) does not contain such explicit intensification. This addition emphasizes the strength of the Marquise's desire.","The phrase \"to tell you truth\" is used instead of the simpler \"en verité\" (in truth) from the source. This common English idiom adds a conversational directness, explicitly addressing the interlocutor (\"you\"), and a tone of confiding that is not as pronounced in the original French.","The adverb \"now\" is added, specifying the immediate present moment of observation of the Moon. This makes the temporal context more explicit than the source \"que nous voyons\" (that we see), which implies the present but doesn't emphasize the immediacy.","The adverb \"too\" is added. This explicitly creates a comparative link between the Marquise's stated concern for the Moon's inhabitants and a potential concern for the inhabitants of Terra Australis, a connection that is only implied in the source.","The phrase \"so great a\" is added to modify \"distance\". The source \"loin de nous\" (far from us) conveys distance, but the target text elaborates and intensifies this concept by adding \"so great a\", making the remoteness more vivid for the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">enfin</span></span> on les connoistra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connoistra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois serieusement, repliquay-je, qu'on ne sçait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moy, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres-ridicule, qui a un air de vraysemblance qui me surprend, je ne sçay où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'estat où estoit l'Amerique avant qu'elle eust esté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Loin de connoistre les Sciences</span></span>, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Cependant voilà un beau jour,</span></span> le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Monstres qui courent sous eux</span></span>, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eust dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Ameriquains plus propres à estre traversées? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">En verité</span></span>, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous estes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">bien loin</span></span> jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">il se perfectionnera</span></span>, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siecles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mestier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">donc</span></span> déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont esté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune sçavent peut-estre déja faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sçait quelle surprise. Vous estes insuportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celuy-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sçay bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien seurs que la Zone Torride, &amp; les Zones Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur, &amp; du temps des Romains la Carte generale de la Terre n'estoit guere plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">En suite</span></span> on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez-bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens. Le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune</span></span>. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu nostre habitation, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">il nous sera permis de connoistre celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune.</span></span> Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la verité qui persuade, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves.</span></span> Elle entre si naturellement dans l'esprit, qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. Ah! vous me soulagez, repliqua la Marquise, vostre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P033: Oh! says she I reckon the Inhabitants of the Terra Australis as known; for 'tis certain they must needs resemble us very much, and in fine, we may know them when ever we take the pains to go see them, there they are and cannot avoid us; but the people of the Moon, we shall never know, 'tis that I despair of. If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd.

I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it?

But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">I'le prove it to you</span></span>. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there.

There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward?

Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order.

The phrase 'so great strangers to knowledge, that' is an added elaboration, providing a more vivid image of the inhabitants' ignorance.","The translator expanded the source 'Cependant voilà un beau jour,' (However, then one fine day,) into 'Yet you see the time came, that...'. The addition of 'you see' creates a direct address to the listener/reader, and 'the time came' offers a more narrative and explicit phrasing of the event's beginning, elements not directly in the concise French phrase.","The source describes 'Monstres qui courent sous eux' (Monsters that run beneath them), referring to horses. The target text says 'governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea'. The clause 'that ran upon the Sea' is an addition that changes the described location of the 'Monsters' action, not present in the source and factually different if 'Monsters' are horses.","The translator rendered the French 'En verité' (In truth/Truly) as the doublet 'Seriously and truly,'. The word 'Seriously' is an addition to 'truly' (a translation of 'verité'), used for lexical emphasis common in older English style.","The French 'enfin' in the phrase 'mais enfin cela ne represente encore que' functions as a logical concluder ('in short', 'ultimately'). The translator used 'in the mean time' in the corresponding phrase 'but that in the mean time does but represent...'. This addition introduces a temporal aspect not strongly implied by 'enfin', altering the nuance.","The source 'il y avoit bien loin' refers to a great (figurative) distance in development. The translator rendered this as 'There was a great distance or difference...'. The term 'or difference' is an addition that explicitly clarifies the metaphorical sense of 'distance' for the English audience.","The translator added the conjunction 'So' at the beginning of the sentence 'So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy;', which translates the French sentence starting 'L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre...'. This 'So' creates an explicit logical link (analogy or consequence) to the preceding discussion, a connection not marked by such a conjunction in the French.","The source states 'il se perfectionnera' (it will be perfected/it will perfect itself). The translator rendered this as 'it will daily grow towards perfection,'. The words 'daily grow' are an addition that elaborates on the process, emphasizing continuous, gradual improvement not as explicitly detailed in the French verb.","The French 'donc' (therefore/then) in 'Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus' was translated as 'Why then,' in 'Why then, says she, almost angry...'. The addition of 'Why' intensifies the Marquise's statement, making it more exclamatory or interrogative in tone, which reflects her expressed emotion.","The French 'En suite' (Then/Subsequently) introducing 'En suite on jugea que...' was translated as 'So likewise' in 'So likewise it was thought that...'. The addition of 'So likewise' creates a more explicit comparative and consequential link to the preceding argument, strengthening the rhetorical connection more than the simple sequential 'En suite'.","The source 'on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune' (one will know up to the Moon) was translated as 'and we shall know all as far as the Moon:'. The word 'all' is an addition that specifies the scope of knowledge (everything up to that point), making an implication in the source explicit.","In the source, 'Sans mentir' (Without lying/To tell the truth) is an interjection by the Marquise starting her own speech. The English translation renders the philosopher's preceding idea as '...make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness...'. This attaches 'without lying' (the translation of 'Sans mentir') to the philosopher's speculation, adding a proposition to his speech that was not originally part of it.","The source states truth persuades 'mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves.' (even without needing to appear with all its proofs). The target text translates this segment as 'and that even not without producing all its proofs,'. The phrase 'not without producing', meaning 'requiring' or 'only if it produces', reverses the original meaning. This introduces a new proposition—that truth *does* require its proofs—which is contrary to the source's assertion."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">TROISIEME SOIR.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P034: THE Third Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P034: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">THE </span></span>Third Evening.</p>","explanations":["The definite article 'THE ' was added by the translator at the beginning of the chapter title.

Je ne soufriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'huy ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois</span></span>, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espece que l'on croit, &amp; en reserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse estre admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paye point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint Denis ressemble à Paris. Le Soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost un Païs, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">&amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert.</span></span> On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait.

A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'éleve point de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que nostre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement ou il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">ou il ne s'en fait point.</span></span> Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoy, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-estre que de grandes cavitez. De la distance ou nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, repliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la verité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantost une partie, tantost une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes. Mais ces mesmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mesmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour estre imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature,</span></span> les Marbres mesmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-mesme, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme nostre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de nostre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable.

Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not. From the moment that we have an interior motion in the parts of the Moon, or produc'd found by foreign causes, the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd, and we have a fund necessary for their subsistance.

While 'contribuent' implies contribution, the addition of 'much' explicitly emphasizes the degree or significance of this contribution, an emphasis not directly quantified in the source text, thus making the statement more forceful for the English reader.","The translator added 'in the matter' to the phrase translating 'S'il ne tenoit qu'à voler;' (If it only depended on flying / If it were only a question of flying;). This addition helps to contextualize 'flying' within the broader discussion, making the condition clearer and more idiomatic for an English-speaking audience.","The translator added 'in time'. The French 'quelque jour?' (some day?) is rendered as 'in time'. While similar, 'in time' often suggests an eventual outcome after a period of development, adding a nuance of expectation or process not as strongly conveyed by a more literal 'some day', thus subtly elaborating on the temporal aspect.","The translator added 'at his first arrival' to the description of the Moon inhabitant's fate. The source 'dés qu'il entreroit dans nostre Air,' (as soon as he entered our Air,) is elaborated by 'at his first arrival,' which emphasizes the specific moment and initial point of entry as the cause of demise, adding vividness and formality.","The translator added 'before us,' altering the spatial reference from the source's 'sur la Terre.' (on the Earth.). This addition shifts the perspective to the immediate presence and viewpoint of the observers (the narrator and the Marquise), enhancing the vividness and dramatic impact of the imagined scene for the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P043: Oh, que j'aurois d'envie, s'écria la Marquise, qu'il arrivast quelque grand naufrage qui répandist icy bon nombre de ces Gens-là, dont nous irions considerer à nostre aise les figures extraordinaires!

The translator added 'it must needs be so' not as a direct translation but as an emphatic assertion. This addition strengthens the point and serves as a bridge to the following clause, making the inherent logic more explicit for the English reader.","The source text states 'bien des barrieres naturelles' (many natural barriers). The translator added the specific number 'three'. This quantification is not present in the source text and seems to be an addition by the translator, possibly to provide a more concrete image or to summarize arguments made previously in the larger work, thus adding a level of specificity absent in the original.","The source text 'ne nous paroissent' (appear to us) implies the location of the observers (Earth). The translator added 'here' to make this deictic reference explicit, thereby enhancing clarity by clearly specifying the viewpoint from which the objects are beheld.","The source text states that the 'Lunette naturelle' (natural lens/perspective) 'nous les change' (changes them for us). The translator elaborated on this by adding 'which shews them otherwise than they are.' This addition explains *how* the objects are changed by the natural perspective, offering a more descriptive clarification of the optical effect.","The source text says 'il paroist bleu' (it appears blue). The translator elaborated this by adding 'and represents it blue to us,' which characterizes the air as an active agent ('represents it') and explicitly names the observer ('to us'). This addition clarifies the mechanism of perception and makes the description more dynamic and detailed.","The source text describes the dives of the Genii as being 'de tres-peu de durée' (of very short duration). The translator added 'to stay any long time' (used in the negative: 'cannot... to stay any long time'), which elaborates on the consequence of these short dives rather than directly translating the duration itself.

The French \"couleur d'or\" (gold-colored) does not specify purity. The addition of \"pure\" intensifies the description, possibly to make the Marquise's preferred aesthetic more vivid or ideal for the English reader.","The French \"assortiriez un habit\" (you would match/coordinate a garment) is partly rendered by \"dressing up...\". The particle \"up\" in the phrasal verb \"dressing up\" adds a nuance of making something more elaborate, smarter, or formal, a detail not explicitly present in the French verb \"assortiriez\".","The French \"un habit\" (a garment/outfit), found in \"que vous assortiriez un habit\", is rendered as \"a Suit of Clothes\". The words \"a Suit of\" specify the general term \"habit\" (translated as \"Clothes\" in this context) into a particular type of clothing, adding a layer of concrete detail not present in the more general source term.","The French text implies \"vous assortiriez... un meuble\" (you would match/coordinate... a piece of furniture), with \"assortiriez\" carried over from the previous clause. This implied verb is effectively replaced by \"furnishing\" in the target text phrase \"or furnishing a Room\". \"Furnishing\" describes a broader, more comprehensive action (outfitting an entire space) than \"assorting\" (matching specific items), thus adding a new scope to the activity.","The French \"un meuble\" (a piece of furniture) in the phrase \"ou un meuble\" is effectively replaced by \"a Room\" in the target text phrase \"or furnishing a Room\".

The French 'de nuance en nuance' (shade by shade/gradually) is less mathematically precise.","The translator added 'again' to explicitly mark the repetition of the situation (being in light then suddenly in darkness), which the source text implies through parallel sentence structure but doesn't state with an adverb like 'again'. This enhances flow and clarity.","The translator added 'light' to 'a middle light' to specify what the French 'un milieu' (a middle/medium) refers to in this context, clarifying that it's a 'middle light' that is absent between day and night on the Moon.","The translator added 'now' to emphasize the current dilemma or consequence arising from the absence of rainbows and auroras, making the rhetorical question more immediate for the English reader.","The translator added 'in the day time' to explicitly state when the Sun is never out of sight, clarifying the context for the English reader, even though the mention of 'Soleil' (Sun) strongly implies daytime.","The translator added 'then' to provide a logical connection to the preceding statements by the Marquise, implying 'given all these advantages, what reason...'. This enhances the rhetorical force of the question for the English reader.","The translator elaborated the French 'cependant' (however/yet) into 'but in the mean time' to provide a slightly more explicit temporal and contrastive link, enhancing flow and perhaps naturalness for the English reader.","The translator specified the French 'toûjours' (always/still) as 'daily' to clarify the frequency of experiencing the scorching sun, making the description more concrete for the English reader in this context.","The translator added 'a mans' to 'over ... head', making the general French 'sur la teste' (on the head) more concrete by specifying a possessor. This may reflect a common stylistic choice of the era to use 'man' generically for 'human'.","The translator added 'but there' to complete the common English idiomatic phrase 'no where else but there,' making the sentence more natural and explicit in English. The French 'point ailleurs, c'est-là que...' (nowhere else, it is there that...) conveys this meaning through sequential clauses.","The translator added 'together' to explicitly state that the populace is collectively in the cavity. While implied by the French 'Tout un Peuple est dans un Puits' (A whole People is in a Pit), 'together' reinforces this idea of collective dwelling for the English reader.","The translator added 'now' to 'You laugh at this Vision' to specify the timing of the Marquise's (presumed) laughter as immediate or current in the conversation, making the scene more vivid.","The translator added 'you should' after 'I heartily agree', elaborating on the French 'j'y consens de tout mon cœr' (I consent to it with all my heart). While the source implies agreement with her mocking, 'you should [laugh]' makes this more explicit and adds a layer of endorsement or active permission.","The translator again elaborated the French 'cependant' (however/yet) into 'but in the mean time' to provide a slightly more explicit temporal and contrastive link, consistent with an earlier instance, enhancing flow and naturalness.","The translator added 'at all' to intensify the negation 'may not live,' rendering the French 'pourroient bien n'habiter pas' (could well not inhabit) with stronger emphasis in English.","The translator expanded the French 'D'icy là' (which can mean 'from this point on', 'consequently', or imply 'between here and there') into the more explicit comparative phrase 'here from what they are there' to clearly delineate the two locations (Earth and Moon) and their differing conditions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle.

But now in a cooler Judgment, I think it would be very strange that the Earth should be so well inhabited as it is, and the other Planets not at all; for I would not have you think that we see all that inhabits the Earth, there are as many species of Animals invisible as visible.

This provides a culturally familiar concept of a blissful afterlife for the English reader, elaborating on the source.","The translator added 'mutually ' before 'transporting them'. While the broader context implies reciprocity, this word makes it explicit in the description of the action of transporting souls from 'de les avoir transportées dans un autre Monde' (by having transported them into another World).","The translator changed 'un autre Monde' (another World, singular) to 'each others World.' The addition of 'each others' elaborates on the destination, emphasizing a reciprocal relationship and the involvement of both planets, a detail not explicit in the singular 'another World'.","The translator elaborated 'd'un point de la Terre' (from a point of the Earth) to 'from one corner of the Earth.' The phrase 'corner of the Earth' is a common English idiom that adds vividness and cultural resonance, making the journey more concrete for the English reader.","The translator elaborated 'en tirant vers le Soleil' (drawing/heading towards the Sun) into 'bending our Course toward the Sun.' The phrase 'bending our Course' is an added descriptive element suggesting a more deliberate and active navigational maneuver.","The translator added 'again' in the phrase 'I return again to Saint Denis.' While the French 'je reprens' (I take up again/I resume) implies repetition through its 're-' prefix, the explicit 'again' in the English rendering reinforces this for clarity or emphasis.","The translator intensified 'bien affermy' (well/very much confirmed) to 'very very much confirm'd.' The addition of an extra 'very' (beyond a standard 'very much') serves as an emphatic elaboration, heightening the perceived degree of conviction.","The translator added 'Mite and the ' before their rendering of 'Ciron' (as 'Cicon'). Since 'Ciron' is a French term for mite, adding the common English word 'Mite' clarifies the reference for the English-speaking audience.","Consistent with the previous instance, the translator added 'Mite and the ' before 'Cicon' (translating 'Ciron') to enhance clarity for the English reader by using the familiar term 'Mite'.","The translator expanded 'le goût' (the taste) to 'the Tast and Relish.' The addition of 'and Relish' elaborates on the sensory experience, suggesting a more complex, piquant, or enjoyable quality beyond simple taste.","The translator elaborated 'les piqueures' (which can mean pricks, stings, or bites) by adding 'biting or ' before 'sting.' This addition clarifies the nature of the 'piqueures' by providing a broader range of common English terms for such actions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Une feüille d'Arbre est un petit Monde habité par des Vermisseaux invisibles, à qui elle paroist d'une étenduë immense, qui y connoissent des Montagnes &amp; des Abismes, &amp; qui d'un costé de la feüille à l'autre n'ont pas plus de communication avec les autres Vermisseaux qui y vivent, que nous avec nos Antipodes.</span></span> A plus forte raison, ce me semble, une grosse Planete sera-t-elle un Monde habité.

The target specifies \"the Worms that inhabit on one side of the Leaf...\". The verb \"inhabit\" is an addition by the translator to describe the worms on the first side. While their presence is implied by context (being inhabitants of the leaf-world), the explicit verb \"inhabit\" for this specific group of worms is not directly present in the French phrasing, which uses a pronoun and a prepositional phrase to locate them. This addition clarifies their active presence on that side of the leaf.","The source phrase \"celles que l'on a toûjours veuës\" translates to \"those that one has always seen\" or \"those that have always been seen.\" The translator’s choice of \"those that we daily see\" introduces the specific frequency \"daily,\" which is not explicitly conveyed by \"toûjours\" (always, still). This addition emphasizes the common, everyday nature of these known animals, possibly for rhetorical effect or to enhance clarity for the target audience by making the familiar more tangibly so.","The word \"then\" is added by the translator. The French \"Croirez-vous\" (Will you believe/Do you believe?) does not contain an explicit equivalent of \"then.\" The translator likely added it to create a smoother logical transition from the preceding arguments, making the discourse more natural for an English reader by explicitly marking the inferential nature of the question.","The phrase \"in her Productions\" is an addition. The source \"poussé icy sa fecondité\" means \"pushed her fecundity here.\" The target translates this idea as \"having been so fruitful in her Productions here.\" While \"fruitful\" relates to \"fecondité\" (fecundity), the noun phrase \"in her Productions\" is an elaboration by the translator, specifying the realm or result of this fruitfulness (i.e., in what Nature produces). This adds a layer of concreteness and detail not explicitly present in the source term \"fecondité\" alone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P051: Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë, dit la Marquise, mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planetes, &amp; embarrassée de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux;</span></span> car je voy bien que la Nature, selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela?

The French states imagination cannot go 'further than the eyes,' while the English suggests the eyes actively 'lead' up to a point, adding a nuance of active guidance not present in the simpler French limit.","The translator changes the construction from 'On peut seulement apercevoir ... la diversité' (One can only perceive ... the diversity) to 'one certain general view may give a prospect of that diversity.' The phrase 'may give a prospect of' adds the idea that the view itself actively offers or reveals the diversity, which is more elaborate than the direct act of perception ('apercevoir') by an agent ('On') in the source.","The translator incorporates 'wrought' into the phrase 'are wrought according to one and the same model,' replacing the simpler French 'sont sur un mesme modele' (are on/based on the same model). The verb 'wrought' adds a connotation of deliberate craftsmanship or skillful creation by Nature, which is not explicit in the original 'sont sur,' thereby elaborating on how faces relate to the model.","The translator uses 'fram'd' in 'seem to be fram'd to two particular models,' to render the French 'paroissent estre faits sur deux modeles particuliers' (seem to be made on/according to two particular models). 'Fram'd' replaces the general verb 'faits' (made) and introduces the idea of being deliberately constructed or structured, adding a nuance of design not explicitly present in 'faits sur.'","The translator changes 'pour varier en tant de manieres' (to vary / in order to vary in so many ways) to 'in framing such variety.' This shifts the meaning by suggesting the secret lies within the *act* or *process* of 'framing' or creating the variety, rather than simply the purpose ('pour') of achieving variation. 'Framing' introduces a specific constructive action by Nature.","The translator uses 'must needs be' for the French 'qu'il faut établir entre eux' (that one must establish / that it is necessary to establish among them). The phrase 'needs be' (with 'be' replacing 'établir') shifts the meaning from a necessary action of 'establishing' or 'positing' diversity to an inherent, necessary 'existence' of diversity. The word 'needs' acts as an intensifier, emphasizing this objective necessity.","The translator adds 'only' to 'one thing' when translating 'une chose aussi simple qu'un visage?' (a thing as simple as a face?). This addition of 'only' to form 'one only thing' specifies and emphasizes singularity ('just one such thing' or 'a single thing'), providing a slightly more restrictive and emphatic meaning than the more general French 'une chose.'"]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P052: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Apparemment les differences augmentent à mesure que l'on s'éloigne</span></span>, &amp; qui verroit un Habitant de la Lune, &amp; un Habitant de la Terre, remarqueroit bien qu'ils seroient de deux Mondes plus voisions qu'un Habitant de la Terre &amp; un Habitant de Saturne.

This addition substantially elevates the degree of certainty expressed, potentially to make the philosopher's statements sound more authoritative or definitive for the English audience of the time.","The translator substitutes 'apparemment' (apparently) with 'doubtless'. This change mirrors the first instance, adding a strong element of certainty to the statement that is not conveyed by the more tentative French original, thereby reinforcing an assertive tone.","The translator inserts the word 'possibly' into the clause. The original French 'où il manque' (where it is lacking) describes the absence of a sense more directly. The addition of 'possibly' introduces a modality of speculation or qualification regarding this lack in other worlds, an element not explicitly present in the source text.","The translator prefaces the sentence with the English interjection 'Nay,'. While the French 'Peut-estre mesme' (Perhaps even) already conveys emphasis, 'Nay,' is a distinct discourse marker added by the translator, likely to enhance the rhetorical impact or signal a particularly noteworthy point in a way idiomatic to English.","The translator renders the French 'de certaines bornes' (certain boundaries/limits) as 'certain bounds and limits'. The addition of 'and limits' creates a stylistic doublet, where two near-synonymous words are used for emphasis or to achieve a fuller, more formal expression, a common practice in English prose of that period.","The translator adds the word 'likewise' to this clause. The French source 'où quelque chose de ce que nous sçavons est inconnu' (where something of what we know is unknown) does not contain an explicit connective adverb of this nature. 'Likewise' is introduced to forge a clearer cohesive link of parallelism or logical consequence with the preceding part of the sentence for the English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Etes-vous contente, Madame</span></span>, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux?</span></span> Vous ay-je dubité assez de chimeres?

The addition of \"now\" emphasizes the present, ongoing nature of the Marquise's imaginative activity, potentially adding vividness or enhancing flow.","The translator added \"and extravagant.\" The French \"des figures tout-à-fait bizarres\" translates to \"utterly bizarre/strange figures.\" The target \"strange and extravagant figures\" elaborates on this by adding \"extravagant,\" which suggests qualities like being excessively fanciful or exceeding reasonable limits, thereby intensifying and specifying the nature of the imagined figures.","The translator added \"well.\" The French \"Je ne vous les pourrois pas décrire\" (I would not be able/could not describe them to you) suggests an inability. The target \"I cannot well describe them\" refines this by indicating an inability to describe them proficiently or adequately, adding a nuance about the quality or completeness of the potential description.","The translator added \"in it.\" The French \"s'ils vous auront bien servie\" (if they will have served you well) is less explicit about the context of this service. The addition of \"in it\" clarifies that the assistance pertains to the previously mentioned task of dreams helping to conceive the figures of planetary inhabitants, thereby enhancing cohesion for the English reader.","The translator added \"of the Shape.\" The French \"comment sont faits les Habitants\" (how the inhabitants are made/what they are like) is a broad inquiry. The target \"inform'd you of the Shape of the Inhabitants\" specifies this inquiry by focusing on their physical form. This elaboration provides a more concrete, though potentially narrower, expectation of what the dreams might reveal, guiding the reader's understanding."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P054: QUATRIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P050: THE Fourth Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P050: THE Fourth Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P055: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Les songes ne furent point heureux:</span></span> ils representerent toûjours quelque chose qui ressembloit à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">ce que l'on voit icy.</span></span> J'eus lieu de reprocher à la Marquise ce que nous reprochent à la veüe de nos Tableaux, de certains Peuples qui ne font jamaïs que des peintures bizarres &amp; grotesques.

The French 'Les songes' (The dreams) is impersonal. The translator adds 'Our' to personalize the statement, making it clear that the dreams belong to the narrator and the Marchioness. This provides clarity by specifying the possessor, a common preference in English.","The translator added 'we' and changed the verb tense. The French 'ce que l'on voit icy.' (what one sees here.) uses an impersonal pronoun ('l'on' - one) and present tense ('voit'). The translator personalizes this to 'we' and shifts the tense to past perfect ('had seen') for narrative consistency with the English text. The addition of 'we' clarifies who is being referred to.","The translator added 'therefore'. The French source sentence begins with 'Come...' (As/Since...), indicating a causal relationship for the subsequent clause. The English translation rephrases the initial part ('She is forty time less than the Earth') and inserts 'therefore' to explicitly mark the logical consequence ('the Earth in Venus seems...'), enhancing clarity for the English reader.","The translator added 'very'. The French phrase 'à peu prés de la mesme grandeur' (approximately of the same size/bigness) is rendered in the target text with 'very near about the same bigness'. While 'near about' is a close equivalent for 'à peu prés', the addition of 'very' serves as an intensifier not explicitly present in the French original, subtly elaborating on the degree of approximation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: Vous m'affligez, dit la Marquise.

This changes the comparison from one of equivalence to one of superiority, elaborating on the quality of the Venusian conversations by suggesting they surpass those of Clelia, a stronger assertion than that made by the source text's 'valent.'","The translator's choice of 'him' (in the phrase 'from him') to refer to the Sun introduces an explicit masculine personification. The French source uses 'en' (meaning 'from it/thereof'), which is a neuter pronoun. While 'Soleil' (Sun) is a masculine noun in French, the pronoun 'en' itself does not carry this gender. This addition elaborates on the Sun's depiction for the English reader, making it more vivid or aligning with poetic conventions.","The source text states Venus receives 'une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur' (a more lively light and more heat). The target text translates this as 'a Light more lively and hot.' By changing 'plus de chaleur' (more heat, a noun phrase indicating a quantity) to the adjective 'hot' directly qualifying 'Light,' the translator makes heat an intrinsic quality of the light itself, rather than a separately mentioned quantity received alongside the light. This subtly alters and specifies the description of what Venus receives."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">interrompit la Marquise</span></span>, comment sont faits les Habitans de Venus.

While 'il faut que' (they must be / it is necessary that they be) is already strong, 'certainly' adds an explicit layer of assertion, making the inference of their madness more pronounced for the English reader.","The translator replaced the French idiomatic term 'Petites Maisons' (which referred to asylums) with 'Bedlam,' the name of a specific and notorious London asylum. This addition provides immediate cultural relevance and vivid clarity for an English audience by using a familiar and concrete reference for a madhouse, thereby adding a layer of specific cultural context not present in the original, more general term.","The translator added 'or Kettle' after 'Stove' as an elaboration of the French 'poêle ardent.' The French word 'poêle' can mean stove or pan. Adding 'or Kettle' provides an alternative or more specific image, aiming to clarify the intended visual of a very hot, possibly rounded, metallic object for English readers.","The translator replaced the French 'apparemment' (apparently, seemingly, likely) with ''tis certain.' This addition significantly changes the epistemic modality of the statement, making the speaker's assertion about the Mercurians' desire for night definitive and unequivocally certain, rather than probable or based on appearance.","The translator intensified the French 'assez grandes' (which can mean 'quite big,' 'rather big,' or 'big enough') to 'very big.'

This is an added proposition that changes the Marquise's expressed sentiment from dismissing public opinion to suggesting a shift in their conversation's focus, possibly to create a clearer narrative transition to the topic of Vortices.","The French 'en un mesme sens' translates to 'in the same direction' or 'in the same manner.' The translator added 'uniformly' to describe the planets' turning motion. This specifies that the motion is regular, consistent, or proceeding at a steady rate, providing a more precise scientific characterization than the original phrase and adding a layer of detail for enhanced clarity regarding the orderliness of the system.","The French 'tourner sur elle-mesme' literally translates to 'to turn on itself.'

The addition of 'Seriously' emphasizes the Marquise's astonishment and earnest reflection, an affective layer not explicitly in the source, likely to enhance her reaction for the English reader.","The source phrase 'd'un grand ordre' (of a great order) appears in 'tout cela est d'un grand ordre'. The target adds 'a work of' to form 'all this is a work of great Order', framing 'Order' more concretely as a result of deliberate design or creation, possibly for rhetorical emphasis or clarity.","The source 'n'a pas esté faite au hazard' (was not made/done by chance), part of 'la distribution des Lunes n'a pas esté faite au hazard', is rendered with an added 'a thing' in 'was not a thing done at random'. This makes the reference to 'the Distribution of Moons' more explicit in the predicate, a common English stylistic choice for clarity.","The source lists planets directly after stating they are distant from the Sun: '...aux Planetes éloignées du Soleil, à la Terre, à Jupiter, à Saturne'. The translator added 'viz.' (an abbreviation for the Latin 'videlicet,' meaning 'namely') before the English list 'the Earth, Iupiter and Saturn' as a formal marker of enumeration, a convention used in English for clarity and structure not present in the French phrasing.","The source implies the Marquise is speaking the line 'Mais attendez...' based on prior attribution and dialogue flow. The translator added the explicit speech tag 'says she' for immediate clarity of the speaker at the beginning of this utterance, which also starts a new paragraph in the target text.","The source's comparative phrase 'plus éloigné du Soleil que la Terre' (further from the Sun than the Earth) is rendered 'father remov'd from the Sun than the Earth is'. The auxiliary verb 'is' is added to complete the comparative clause referring to 'the Earth', a common feature for grammatical fullness and naturalness in English.","The source phrase '& il faut qu'il ait...' (and it is necessary that he has... / and he must have...) is translated with an added 'therefore' in 'and therefore he must have...'. This explicitly articulates the logical consequence (Mars needing other resources due to lacking a moon), enhancing argumentative clarity for the English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oyseaux.

The source text uses the pronoun 'elle' (she), relying on context, whereas the target text provides the specific title for greater clarity for the English reader.","The translator added 'Truly' at the beginning of the philosopher's response ('Truly said I'). This adverb is not a direct translation of any specific word in the corresponding French phrase 'répondis-je' (I replied) but is an addition likely for rhetorical emphasis or to make the speech sound more natural or assertive in English.","The translator added 'I think' before 'we cannot well dispense...'. The French source 'on ne peut pas se dispenser de...' ('one cannot dispense with...') is impersonal. The addition of 'I think' personalizes the statement, attributing the opinion directly to the speaker and making it more subjective.","The French exclamation 'que de Mondes!' translates to 'so many worlds!' or 'what a lot of worlds!'. The translator's phrase 'what an infinity of Worlds' introduces the specific and stronger concept of 'infinity,' which is an elaboration and intensification not explicitly present in the source text's general expression of a large quantity.","The French 'quelle lumiere' can be ambiguous, meaning either 'what light!' (exclamatory, perhaps about its dimness) or 'what kind of light?'. The translator added 'sort of a' to 'what light', rendering it as 'what sort of a light'. This addition clarifies the meaning by specifying that the query is about the nature or type of the light.","The source text 'en me parlant de Mercure' translates to 'in speaking to me of Mercury' or 'while you spoke to me of Mercury.' The target text's 'in your discourse of Mercury' elaborates on the simple act of speaking by framing it as a more formal 'discourse.'

The translator renders this as \"men do not take the pains to compute it.\" This addition of \"men\" specifies the agent, which could reflect the common, albeit gendered, generic use of \"men\" for \"people\" in the English of that period, or it might be intended to provide a more concrete agent for the English reader, possibly alluding to the astronomers of the time.","The French source text \"eust cette force et cette vivacité qu'a celle des Etoiles Fixes\" describes an inherent quality of starlight (literally, \"had that force and vivacity that that [the light] of the Fixed Stars has\"). The target text's phrasing, \"should retain that force and vivacity which we find in the fixed Stars,\" introduces the words \"we find.\" This addition explicitly includes the human observer (\"we\") and their act of perception or discovery (\"find\"), thereby emphasizing the empirical aspect for the reader.","The French source text \"Les voila donc lumineuses par elles-mêmes\" (literally, \"So there they are, luminous by themselves\" or \"Thus they are luminous by themselves\") is a declarative, presentative statement. The translator transforms this into \"You see then they are all luminous in themselves.\" The addition of \"You see\" (as \"then\" corresponds to \"donc\") directly addresses the interlocutor (the Marquise, and by extension, the reader), making the conclusion more engaging and framed as an appeal to their direct understanding or perception, enhancing the dialogic nature of the text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P087: Ne me trompay-je point, s'écria la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">ou si je vois où vous me voulez mener?</span></span> M'allez-vous dire: Les Etoiles Fixes sont autant de Soleils, nostre Soleil est le centre d'un Tourbillon qui tourne autour de luy, pourquoy chaque Etoile Fixe ne sera-t-elle pas aussi le centre d'un Tourbillon <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">qui aura un mouvement autour d'elle</span></span>?

While the French sentence's earlier use of 'aussi' ('ne sera-t-elle pas aussi le centre' - 'will it not also be the center') establishes that the star is a center like our Sun, the addition of 'likewise' specifically to the motion of the vortex explicitly reinforces this analogy for the English reader by emphasizing the similarity of the motions themselves."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P088: Mais, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">voila l'Univers si grand que je m'y perds, je ne sçais plus où je suis, je ne suis plus rien.</span></span> Quoy, tout sera divisé en Tourbillons jettez confusément les uns parmi les autres?

While the French 'voila' can convey surprise, the addition of 'why' (used in older English to express strong surprise or call attention) amplifies this emotion or makes the utterance more stylistically emphatic in English.","The translator added 'for my share,' to the philosopher's response. The French 'Et moy' (And I / As for me) indicates a shift in perspective. The addition 'for my share,' elaborates on this, emphasizing his personal contrasting feeling more explicitly and idiomatically in English.","The translator expanded the French 'comme oppressé' (as if oppressed/crushed) by adding 'straighten'd and' before 'oppress'd'.

This addition narrows the scope of the general human behavior described ('si on a tant d'ardeur de s'agrandir' - if one has so much eagerness to aggrandize oneself), potentially reflecting societal norms of the translator's time or a specific interpretation, which is notable in a work addressing a female audience.","The translator added 'only' to the phrase 'only because they are ignorant of these Vortices'. This addition strengthens the causal link, suggesting that ignorance of the vortices is the sole reason for human striving, an emphasis not explicitly present in the source 'c'est que l'on ne connoist pas les Tourbillons..' (it is that one does not know the Vortices...).","The translator added 'unactive' to 'negligence' (the translation of 'indolence' from 'mon indolence'). The phrase 'an unactive negligence' further specifies the type of behavior, possibly for emphasis or to create a more descriptive phrase in English than the source's 'mon indolence' (my indolence).","The translator added the introductory phrase 'The truth is,' which is not present in the source that begins 'A plus forte raison...' (All the more reason...). This phrase serves as a discourse marker to emphasize the following statement or to transition the argument, adding a specific English rhetorical flavor.","The translator added 'mind' as the object of 'cure' in 'cure only an unquiet and ambitious mind.' While ambition and restlessness are mental states, the source states they cure 'de l'ambition & de l'inquietude' (of ambition and restlessness). The addition of 'mind' makes the object of the cure more explicit and concrete for the English reader.","The translator added 'foolish' to describe the 'inclination' (which translates 'foiblesse' - weakness from 'Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau'). This addition characterizes the weakness/inclination in a way not explicitly present in the source, possibly to add a slightly self-deprecating or charming tone to the philosopher's confession.","The translator added 'all' before 'my malady' in 'is all my malady'. This emphasizes that the 'little foolish inclination' is the entirety of his problem, an emphasis not explicitly conveyed by the source's simpler 'voila mon mal' (that is my malady).","The translator used the phrase 'do me little kindness' where the source '& je ne croy pas que les Tourbillons y puissent rien' means 'and I do not believe that the Vortices can do anything about it.' The introduction of 'kindness' adds a nuanced concept, personifying the (lack of) effect of the vortices or framing their inutility in a gentler, more idiomatic English way than a direct translation of 'do nothing'.","The translator added 'you say,' in the sentence 'The other Worlds, you say, make this seem little to you'. This phrase attributes the idea that 'other Worlds make this one seem little' (source: 'Les autres Mondes vous rendent celuy-cy petit') more directly to the Marquise, making the dialogue more explicit or recalling her earlier sentiments.","The translator elaborated 'mais ils ne vous gâtent point de beaux yeux' (but they do not spoil your beautiful eyes at all) into 'but yet they obscure not the Lustre of your Eyes.' The addition of 'the Lustre of' provides a more specific, poetic, and vivid detail about how the eyes are unaffected, enhancing the imagery."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">répondit-elle en riant</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">il se sauve de tout</span></span>, &amp; il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Mais aussi parlez-moy franchement</span></span>, vostre Systême est-il bien vray?

The translator adds \"and Judgment\" to \"Wit\" (the chosen translation of \"esprit\") to elaborate on the intellectual acuity being praised, specifying discernment alongside cleverness, thereby normalizing and possibly strengthening the compliment for an English audience.","The French text uses \"aussi-tost\" (immediately/then) to connect the previously described situation (formation of voids) with Nature's subsequent action. The translator introduces \"in that case,\" as an additional contextualizing phrase. This addition serves to create a more explicit logical link for the English reader, clarifying that Nature's intervention is a direct response to the specific scenario of voids forming, enhancing cohesion in the target text.","The French phrase \"qui ménage bien le terrain\" (who manages the ground/space well) describes Nature's efficiency. The translator elaborates this into \"who knows well how to manage the matter.\" This addition makes explicit the inherent knowledge or skill underlying Nature's efficiency and generalizes the scope of this management from \"le terrain\" (the ground/space) to \"the matter,\" providing a clearer and more emphatic characterization of Nature's capabilities for the English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">J'aime fort toutes ces Idées-là</span></span>, dit la Marquise.

The introduction of the noun 'kindness' is an elaboration. While the overall meaning of strong liking is conveyed, the specific noun 'kindness' introduces a particular nuance, possibly of gentle sentiment or formal politeness, that is not explicitly present in the French verb-adverb construction 'aime fort'.

Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoistre, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Mais que dirons-nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mesmes?</span></span> Vous estes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en vostre faveur. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir.</span></span> En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantost plus grandes, tantost plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus legers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur, il y a des Etoiles fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroistre &amp; disparoistre, &amp; enfin disparoissent entierement, des demi Soleils reparoîtroient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoistroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoistre de longtemps. Prenez vostre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'estre visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en luy-mesme une source de lumiere?</span></span> Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, répondis-je, nostre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des broüillards, ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces taches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toujours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée belle, dit-on. Le Soleil a esté tres-pasle pendant des années entieres, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">C'estoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire, la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa; mais si elle eust continué, nous estions perdus.</span></span> Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je sçay les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pasle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris-je: Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changemens: soit lents, soit prompts, mais toujours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens estoient plaisans de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoyent pas encore vû changer. Avoyent-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'experience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se laissoient des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoyent suivre, n'y auroient rien changé.</span></span> Sur cela elles diroient, nous avons toûjours vû le mesme Jardinier, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy</span></span>, il a toûjours esté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroistroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience.</span></span> Devons-nous établir nostre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque-autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses mêmes qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attens bien que s'il disparoist des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroist de nouvelles, il faut que l'espece se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir esté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démeslez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je croy aisément que tout cela peut estre, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir esté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir esté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différens, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondemens d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naistre &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'estes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, repliquay-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au delà, il faudroit estre plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent estre ou n'estre pas si on veut, ou estre tels que l'on veut, il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P106: I need not then, continued I, think any more of persuading you to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, but I hope, at least, you will compassionate those that live in a Vortex where the Sun is extinct. How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</p> <p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</p> <p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature. Has not she the secret of causing Herbs and Plants to spring and dye in a continual Revolution? I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it.</p> <p>P111: In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that I have e'en left them.</p> <p>P112: Let us leave them more yet, said I, if you'l be persuaded by me, and talk no more of them; for you are now come to the highest Roof of Heaven, and to tell you whether there be Stars beyond that or not, will require more knowledge than I have.

The French 'nous ne pourrons plus les voir' (we will no longer be able to see them) states the result, while the English addition explains the mechanism of invisibility more explicitly.","The translator added 'and Spring' to 'Source of Light,' creating a doublet (a common rhetorical device). This stylistic choice amplifies the concept of the sun being a fundamental origin of light, making it more emphatic for the English reader. The French 'une source de lumiere' means 'a source of light.'","The translator added 'upon the Sun' to the phrase 'it was the Crust that began then to grow.' The French 'C'estoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire' (it was the crust that was beginning to form) is less specific about the location of the crust's formation in this immediate clause, although context implies it. The addition explicitly links the crust's growth to the Sun, enhancing clarity.","The translator added 'to Posterity' when translating 'celles qui les devoyent suivre' (those who were to follow them). While the meaning is similar, 'to Posterity' elevates the language and broadens the concept from immediate successors to future generations in a more formal way, aligning with a common stylistic preference in English translations of the period.","The translator rendered the French phrase 'de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy' (literally, 'by memory of Rose one has seen only him') as 'our History tells us of no other.' This transforms the impersonal 'on a vû' (one has seen) and the abstract 'memoire de Rose' into a more active and personified 'our History tells us,' providing a more conventional and vivid narrative framing for an English audience.","The translator added 'farther satisfaction from' to the phrase 'j'attendrois une plus longue experience' (I would wait for a longer experience). This addition specifies the purpose or expected outcome of waiting for longer experience – to gain 'farther satisfaction' or more conclusive evidence – a nuance not explicitly stated in the source.","The translator added 'though in all this time' and restructured the clause. The French 'aprés le temps pendant lequel' (after the time during which) sets up a temporal condition for an expected event (the star's reappearance after completing its rotation). The English addition 'though in all this time' introduces a concessive conjunction ('though'), which emphasizes the unexpectedness of the stars not reappearing *despite* the passage of sufficient time for their rotation. This adds a specific rhetorical nuance of failed expectation not explicitly framed with 'though' in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">j'ay dans la teste tout le systeme de l'Univers!</span></span></span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Je suis sçavante!</span></span></span></span> Oüy, repliquay-je, vous l'estes assez raisonnablement, &amp; vous l'estes avec la commodité de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra.
