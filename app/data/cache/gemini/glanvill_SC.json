This phrase explicitly states the Copernican heliocentric model, a core theme of Fontenelle's work. In the late 17th-century English context, particularly during the reign of James II (1685-1689) with its heightened religious and political tensions, and efforts by some religious authorities to reinforce theological orthodoxy against new scientific ideas, this direct assertion of a potentially controversial scientific model could be deemed ideologically sensitive. Omitting this statement from a prominent chapter title serves to ideologically sanitize the heading, making the work's challenging scientific stance less immediately confrontational and potentially more palatable to a society grappling with religious anxieties and the authority of traditional beliefs. This deliberate removal of a key scientific premise from the title aligns with self-censorship by filtering out content that could be perceived as challenging established religious or cultural views."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P002: Nous allâmes donc un Soir aprés Soupé, nous promener dans le Parc. Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement.</span></span> La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"2\">où elles sont attachées</span></span>. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"1\">Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet.</span></span> Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"3\">semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"4\">favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface.

Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée. Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle. Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire.

Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, répliquai-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

This sentence, which appears in the source text after the initial scene-setting and before the description of the moon and stars, is entirely absent in the translation. This filtering of authorial intrusion, a characteristic feature of Fontenelle's style and common in French literature of the period, might have been done to align the text with English narrative conventions, making it less of a personal treatise and more of a straightforward dialogue. This can be seen as a cultural filtering, removing a specific stylistic element that shapes the author-reader relationship.","This omitted exchange, part of the witty dialogue between the philosopher and the Marquise about blonde and brunette beauty, contains playful gallantry, including the philosopher's flirtatious compliment and the Marquise's clever response. The translator might have removed this entire section to make the tone more sober or less 'French' in its courtliness, possibly deeming such light-hearted flirtation inappropriate or distracting from the scientific content for an English audience concerned with propriety, especially given the context of a man instructing a woman. This represents a cultural filtering of social interaction styles and potentially reflects a more puritanical sensibility in the target culture.","The omission of 'où elles sont attachées' (to which they are attached), referring to stars appearing fixed against the blue background of the sky, removes a phrase that could subtly evoke the older, pre-Copernican model of stars being fixed to celestial spheres. While Fontenelle might have used it poetically, a translator in the late 17th century, aiming to popularize modern astronomy and avoid confusion with outdated cosmological views (which were sometimes defended by religious authorities), might deliberately filter out such potentially ambiguous phrasing. The target text replaces the detailed French description with the more general 'the Stars were in all their Glory', thus sanitizing it from a possible interpretation aligning with older, challenged cosmic models.","The omission of the detailed description of stars as 'semées confusément, & disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes' (sown confusedly, & arranged by chance in a thousand different figures) filters out a potentially controversial view of the cosmos. The key element 'disposées au hasard' (arranged by chance) could be interpreted as challenging the prevailing religious notion of a divinely ordered and meticulously designed universe. In the socio-religious context of late 17th-century England, with its undercurrents of theological debate, such phrasing might be seen as leaning towards materialistic or even atheistic interpretations. Its replacement with the simpler 'shews us ten thousand Stars' serves as an ideological sanitization.","The replacement of the phrase 'favorise la resverie, & un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.' (favors reverie, & a certain disorder of thoughts into which one does not fall without pleasure.) with the more anodyne 'which inspire us with as many pleasant Ideas.' tones down Fontenelle's specific and somewhat radical characterization of the imaginative state induced by stargazing. The concept of 'desordre de pensées' (disorder of thoughts), even if pleasurable, could be viewed as undermining the primacy of rational, orderly thought, a potential concern in a more conservative cultural or religious climate that valued mental discipline. The translation opts for the more neutral 'pleasant Ideas,' sanitizing the text of the potentially challenging endorsement of intellectual pleasure derived from mental 'disorder,' which prefigures Enlightenment celebrations of imaginative freedom.","The omission of the philosopher's assertion 'Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.' (According to me, even Truths require pleasantness/charm.) removes a key epistemological and pedagogical statement by Fontenelle. This idea is central to his project of making science accessible and appealing. However, it could be interpreted as undermining the absolute, divinely-instituted, or austere nature of Truth, particularly religious or philosophical truths which were often presented as requiring acceptance regardless of their 'agrément'. In a period sensitive to challenges to theological orthodoxy, this statement might have been considered too relativistic or frivolous concerning 'Veritez' (Truths), leading to its censorship to maintain a more conventional stance on the nature and reception of truth."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire,</span></span> &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière de Physique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; &amp; les Planètes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des mondes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"1\">J'en revenois toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place.</span></span> A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes: &amp; si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir, ce qui reviendrait au même. Mais on veut savoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyait bien, ce serait toujours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voient point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toujours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opéra. Du lieu où vous êtes à l'Opéra, vous ne voyez pas le Théâtre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à votre veue ces roues &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvements. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner comment tout cela joue. Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien qu'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers; car représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyaient le Vol de Phaéton que les Vents enlèvent, qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton. L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"2\">L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide;</span></span> &amp; cent autres rêveries, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"3\">que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité.</span></span> A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenue bien mécanique? Si mécanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bientôt honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvements régléz qui dépendent de l'arrangement des parties. Avouez la vérité. N'avez-vous pas eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne méritoit? J'ay vu des gens qui l'en estimoient moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoient connu. Et moy, répliqua-t'elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sais qu'il ressemble à une Montre. Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P004: But in vain I excus'd my self, who could resist so many Charms? I was forc'd to yield, and yet I knew not where to begin; for to a Person who understood nothing of Natural Philosophy you must go a great way about to prove that the Earth may be a Planet, the Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars worlds; however to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I at last resolv'd on this Method. All Philosophy, said I, Madam, is founded upon two things, either that we are too short sighted, or that we are too curious; for if our eyes were better than they are, we should soon see whether the Stars were worlds or not; and if on the other side we were less curious, we should not care whether the Stars are Worlds or not, which I think is much to the same purpose. But the business is, we have a mind to know more than we see: And again, if we could discern well what we do see, it would be so much known to us: But we see things quite otherwise than they are. So that your true Philosopher will not believe what he doth see, and is alwaies conjecturing at what he doth not, which is a Life I think not much to be envy'd: Upon this I fancy to my self, that Nature very much resembleth an Opera, where you stand, you do not see the Stage as really it is; but it is plac'd with advantage, and all the Wheels and Movements are hid, to make the Representation the more agreeable: Nor do you trouble your self how, or by what means the Machines are moved, tho' certainly an Engineer in the Pit is affected with what doth not touch you; he is pleas'd with the motion, and is demonstrating to himself on what it depends, and how it comes to pass. This Engineer then is like a Philosopher, tho' the difficulty is greater on the Philosophers part, the Machines of the Theatre being nothing so curious as those of Nature, which disposeth her Wheels and Springs so out of sight, that we have been long a guessing at the movement of the Universe. Suppose then the Sages at an Opera, the Pithagoras's, the Plato's, the Aristotles, and all the Wise Men who have made such a noise in the World, for these many Ages: We will suppose 'em at the Representation of Phaeton, where they see the aspiring Youth lifted up by the Winds, but do not discover the Wires by which he mounts, nor know they any thing of what is done behind the Scenes. Would you have all these Philosophers own themselves to be stark Fools, and confess ingenuously they know not how it comes to pass: No, no, they are not called Wise Men for nothing; tho', let me tell you, most of their Wisdom depends upon the ignorance of their Neighbours. Every man presently gives his Opinion, and how improbable so ever, there are Fools enough of all sorts to believe 'em: One tells you Phaeton is drawn up by a hidden Magnetick Vertue, no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question. Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra: A third tells you, Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company, with an hundred such extravagant fancies, that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers: But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera. I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it; they will have the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement. But pray tell me, Madam, had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe? Do you not think you did then honour it more than it deserv'd? For most have the less esteem of it since they have pretended to know it. I am not of their opinion, said she, I value it the more since I know it resembles a Watch, and the whole order of Nature the more plain and easie it is, to me it appears the more admirable.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P004: But in vain I excus'd my self, who could resist so many Charms? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">I was forc'd to yield, and yet I knew not where to begin;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"1\">for to a Person who understood nothing of Natural Philosophy you must go a great way about to prove that the Earth may be a Planet, the Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars worlds; however to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I at last resolv'd on this Method.</span></span> All Philosophy, said I, Madam, is founded upon two things, either that we are too short sighted, or that we are too curious; for if our eyes were better than they are, we should soon see whether the Stars were worlds or not; and if on the other side we were less curious, we should not care whether the Stars are Worlds or not, which I think is much to the same purpose.

Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"2\">A third tells you, Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"3\">with an hundred such extravagant fancies, that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers:</span></span></span></span> But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera. I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it; they will have the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement. But pray tell me, Madam, had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe? Do you not think you did then honour it more than it deserv'd? For most have the less esteem of it since they have pretended to know it. I am not of their opinion, said she, I value it the more since I know it resembles a Watch, and the whole order of Nature the more plain and easie it is, to me it appears the more admirable.</p>","explanations":["The philosopher's insistence on the Marquise's secrecy specifically 'pour la conservation de mon honneur' (for the preservation of my honor) is omitted. This phrase highlights the potentially controversial or socially unconventional nature of him teaching her these scientific topics. Its omission sanitizes the text by removing the implication that the discussion is dangerous, reputation-damaging, or subversive, which would be particularly sensitive in the tense English socio-political and religious climate of 1687-1688.","The philosopher's reflection that it would have been better to discuss 'bagatelles' (trifles), 'comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place' (as all reasonable people would have done in our place), is omitted. This omission removes Fontenelle's commentary on the unconventionality of their serious scientific discussion, especially involving a woman. Censoring this normalizes the conversation, making it seem less of a departure from societal expectations and thus ideologically sanitizing its radical nature for the English audience.","This fourth example, illustrating flawed ancient reasoning about Phaeton's flight ('Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide' - Phaeton was not made to fly, but he prefers to fly than to leave the top of the theatre empty), is omitted from the list of ancient philosophers' 'rêveries'. This specific example satirizes teleological arguments reminiscent of Aristotelian physics (e.g., 'nature abhors a vacuum'). Given that Aristotelianism was still influential and intertwined with scholastic tradition, omitting this direct mockery of one of its reasoning styles could have been a deliberate choice to avoid offending conservative philosophical or even theological sensibilities, contributing to a general softening of the critique of ancient thought.","Fontenelle's poignant expression of surprise – 'que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité' (which I am astonished have not ruined the reputation of all Antiquity) – is omitted and replaced with the much milder 'that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers:'. The original is a sharp critique of the uncritical reverence for ancient philosophers, implying their 'rêveries' should have discredited them. The translation defangs this ideological criticism by recasting the ancient sages as mere 'banterers,' thus sanitizing a potentially offensive challenge to the deeply entrenched cultural authority of Classical Antiquity in the late 17th century."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P005: Je ne sais pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en vérité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir.

The source states that many people have a \"false Marvelous\" in their minds. The translation rephrases this general idea as \"People generally admire what they do not comprehend,\" which describes an action and its object but crucially omits the direct accusation that the \"Marvelous\" itself is \"false.\" In the late 17th century, labeling such respected marvels or mysteries (potentially including religious ones) as \"false\" could be provocative. Removing \"faux\" sanitizes this critique, making the statement less confrontational towards established beliefs that valued mystery over rational explanation.","The omission of \"dernière\" (last/ultimate) from the source phrase \"cette dernière voûte des Cieux\" (this last/ultimate vault of the Heavens) significantly alters the cosmological reference. The original French term specifically alludes to the outermost sphere of the fixed stars in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, a concept with strong historical and theological ties. The translation \"this great Vault\" generalizes the term, removing the explicit idea of a final, bounding celestial sphere. This change downplays the direct engagement with the specifics of the old, Church-endorsed cosmology that Fontenelle's work was gently subverting. In the religiously and politically sensitive environment of 1680s England, this omission likely served to make the text less challenging to traditional views of the universe."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie. La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus intéressée que je ne l'ai, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus.</span></span> Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation. Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire. Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, 'tis not a true Shepherds life to talk of the Stars and Planets: See if they pass their time so in Astrea. That sort of Shepherds Craft, reply'd she, is too dangerous for me to learn: I love the honest Caldaeans, and you must teach me their Rules, if you would have me improve in their Science. But let us proceed, When they had rank'd the Heavens in that manner you tell me, pray, what is the next Question? The next, said I, is the disposing the several parts of the Universe, which the Learned call making a Systeme; but before I expound the first Systeme, I would have you observe, we are all naturally like that Mad man at Athens, who fancy'd all the Ships were his that came into the Port Pyroeum: Nor is our Folly less extravagant, we believe all things in Nature design'd for our use; and do but ask a Philosopher, to what purpose there is that prodigious company of fix'd Stars, when a far less number would perform the service they do us? He answers coldly, they were made to please our Sight. Upon this Principle they imagin'd the Earth rested in the Centre of the Universe, while all the Celestial Bodies (which were made for it) took the Page 15 pains to turn round to give light to it. They plac'd the Moon above the Earth, Mercury above the Moon, after Venus the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, above all these they set the Heaven of fix'd Stars, the Earth was just in the middle of those Circles which contain the Planets, and the greater the Circles were, they were the farther distant from the Earth, and by consequence the farthest Planets took up the most time in finishing their course, which in effect is true: But why, said the Countess, interrupting me, do you dislike this Systeme? It seems to me very Clear and Intelligible. However, Madam, said I, I will make it plainer; for should I give it you as it came from Ptolomy its Author, or from some who have since study'd it, I should fright you, I fancy, instead of diverting you. Since the Motions of the Planets are not so regular, but that sometimes they go faster, sometimes slower, sometimes are nearer the Earth, and sometimes farther from it; the Ancients did invent I do not know how many Orbs or Circles involv'd one within another, which they thought would salve all Objections; this confusion of Circles was so great, that at that time when they knew no better, a certain King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but not much troubled with Religion, said, That had God consulted him when he made the World, he would have told him how to have fram'd it better. The fancy was very Atheistical, and no doubt the Instructions he would have given the Almighty, was the suppressing those Circles with which they had clog'd the Celestial Motions, and the taking away two or three superfluous Heavens which they had placed above the fixed Stars; for these Philosophers to explain the Motion of the Celestial Bodies, had above the uppermost Heaven (which we see,) found another of Crystal, to influence and give Motion to the inferiour Heavens; and wherever they heard of another Motion, they presently clapp'd up a Crystal Heaven which cost 'em Page 17 nothing. But why must their Heaven be of Crystal, said the Countess, would nothing else serve as well? No, no, I reply'd, nothing so well; for the Light was to come thro' them, and yet they were to be solid. Aristotle would have it so, he had found Solidity to be one of their Excellencies, and when he had once said it, no body would be so rude as to question it. But it seems there were Comets much higher than the Philosophers expected, which as they pass'd along brake the Crystal Heavens, and confounded the Universe. But to make the best of a bad Market, they presently melt down their broken Glass, and to Aristotles Confusion, made the heavens fluid; and by the observations of these latter Ages it is now out of doubt, that Venus and Mercury turn round the Sun, and not round the Earth, according to the Antient Systeme, which is now every where exploded, and all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush. But that which I am going to lay down, will salve all, and is so clear, that the King of Arragon himself may spare his Advice. Methinks, saith the Countess, your Philosophy is a kind of Out-cry, where he that offers to do the work cheapest, carries it from all the rest. 'Tis very true, said I, Nature is a great Huswife, she always makes use of what costs least, let the difference be never so inconsiderable; and yet this frugality is accompany'd with an extraordinary magnificence, which shines thro' all her works; that is, she is magnificent in the design, but frugal in the Execution; and what can be more praise worthy, than a great design accomplish'd with a little Expence? But in our Ideas we turn things topsy-turvy, we place our thrift in the design, and are at ten times more charge in Workmanship than it requires, which is very ridiculous: Imitate Nature then, saith she, in your Systeme, and give me as little trouble as you can to comprehend you. Fear it not, Madam, said I, we have done with our impertinencies: Imagine then a German all'd Copernicus confounding every thing, earing in pieces the beloved Circles of Antiquity, and shattering their Crystal Heavens like so many Glass Windows, seiz'd with the noble Rage of Astronomy, he snatcheth up the Earth from the Centre of the Universe, sends her packing, and placeth the Sun in the Centre to which it did more justly belong, the Planets no longer turn round the Earth, and do not inclose it in the Circles they describe; if they give us light, it is but by chance, and as they meet us in their way. All now turns round the Sun, the Earth her self goes round the Sun, and Copernicus to punish the Earth for her former Lazyness, makes her contribute all he can to the motion of the Planets and Heavens, and now stripp'd of all the heavenly Equipage with which she was so gloriously attended, she hath nothing left her but the Moon, which still turns round about her: Fair and softly, saith the Countess, I fancy you your self are seiz'd with the Noble Fury of Astronomy; a little less Rapture, and I shall understand you the better. The Sun You say is in the Centre of the Universe, and is immovable; what follows next? It is Mercury, said I, he turns round the Sun, so that the Sun is the Centre of the Circle wherein Mercury moves; above Mercury is Venus, who turns also round the Sun; after comes the Earth, which being placed higher than Mercury and Venus, makes a greater circle round the Sun than either of them; at last come Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, in the same order I name 'em, so that Saturn hath the greatest circle round the Sun, which is the reason he is a longer time in making his Revolution than any of the other Planets. And the Moon, you have forgot her, said she: We shall quickly find her again, said I; the Moon turns round the Earth, and doth not leave her, but as the Earth advanceth in the Circle, which she describes about the Sun, and if the Moon turns round the Sun, it is because she will not quit the Earth; I understand you, said she, and I love the Moon for staying with us when all the other Planets do abandon us; nay, I fear your German would have willingly taken her away too if he could, for in all his proceedings, I find he had a great spight to the Earth. 'Twas well done of him, said I, to abate the Vanity of Mankind, who had taken up the best place in the Universe, and it pleaseth me to see the Earth in the croud of the Planets. Sure, said she, you do not think their Vanity extends it self as far as Astronomy! Do you believe you have humbled me, in telling me the Earth goes round the Sun? For my part I do not think my self at all the worse for't. I confess, said I, Madam, I believe a Fair Lady would be much more concern'd for her place at a Ball, than for her rank in the Universe; and the Precedence of two Planets will not make half such a noise in the World, as that of two Ambassadours; however the same inclination which reigns at a Ceremony, governs in a Systeme, and if you love the uppermost place in the one, the Philosopher desires the Centre in the other; he flatters himself that all things were made for him, and insensibly believes a matter of pure speculation to be a point of Interest. This is a Calumny, said she, you have invented against Mankind; why did they receive this Systeme if it was so abasing? I know not, said I, but I am sure Copernicus himself distrusted the success of his Opinion, he was a long time before he would venture to publish it, nor had he done it then without the importunity of his Friends. But do you know what became of him? the very day they brought him the first Proof of his Book, he dy'd; he foresaw he should never be able to clear all the contradictions, and very wisely slipt out of the way. I would be just to all the World, said the Countess; but 'tis hard to fancy we move and yet see we do not change our place; we find our selves in the Morning where we lay down at Night: Perhaps you will tell me the whole Earth moves-Yes certainly, said I, it is the same case as if you fell asleep in a Boat upon the River, when you awake you find your self in the same place, and the same situation in respect of all the parts of the Boat. 'Tis true, she reply'd, but here's a great difference when I awake I find another shoar, and that shows me, my Boat hath chang'd place. But 'tis not the same with the Earth, I find all things as I left 'em. No, no, said I, there is another Shoar too; You know that beyond the circles of the Planets are fix'd Stars, there is our Shoar. I am upon the Earth, and the Earh makes a great circle round the Sun, I look for the centre of the circle and see the Sun there, I then direct my sight beyond the Sun in a right Line, and should certainly discover the fix'd Stars which answer to the Sun, but that the light of the Sun effaceth 'em: But at Night I easily perceive the Stars which corresponded with him in the day, which is exactly the same thing; if the Earth did not change its place in the Circle where it is, I should see the Sun always against the same fix'd Stars, but when the Earth doth change its place, the Sun must answer to other Stars and there again is your Shoar, which is always changing. And seeing the Earth makes her circle in a year, I see the Sun likewise in the space of a year answer successively to the whole Circle of the fix'd Stars, which Circle is call'd the Zodiack: I will draw you the Figure of it, if you please, on the Sand? 'Tis no matter, said she, I can do well enough without it; beside, it will give an Air of Learning to my Park which I would not have in it: For I have heard of a certain Philosopher, who being Shipwrack'd, and cast upon an unknown Island, seeing several Mathematical Figures trac'd on the Sea-shore, cry'd out to those that follow'd him, Courage, Courage, my Companions, the Isle is inhabited, behold the Footsteps of Men; But you may spare your Figures, such Footsteps are not decent here.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, 'tis not a true Shepherds life to talk of the Stars and Planets: See if they pass their time so in Astrea. That sort of Shepherds Craft, reply'd she, is too dangerous for me to learn: I love the honest Caldaeans, and you must teach me their Rules, if you would have me improve in their Science. But let us proceed, When they had rank'd the Heavens in that manner you tell me, pray, what is the next Question? The next, said I, is the disposing the several parts of the Universe, which the Learned call making a Systeme; but before I expound the first Systeme, I would have you observe, we are all naturally like that Mad man at Athens, who fancy'd all the Ships were his that came into the Port Pyroeum: Nor is our Folly less extravagant, we believe all things in Nature design'd for our use; and do but ask a Philosopher, to what purpose there is that prodigious company of fix'd Stars, when a far less number would perform the service they do us? He answers coldly, they were made to please our Sight. Upon this Principle they imagin'd the Earth rested in the Centre of the Universe, while all the Celestial Bodies (which were made for it) took the Page 15 pains to turn round to give light to it. They plac'd the Moon above the Earth, Mercury above the Moon, after Venus the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, above all these they set the Heaven of fix'd Stars, the Earth was just in the middle of those Circles which contain the Planets, and the greater the Circles were, they were the farther distant from the Earth, and by consequence the farthest Planets took up the most time in finishing their course, which in effect is true: But why, said the Countess, interrupting me, do you dislike this Systeme? It seems to me very Clear and Intelligible. However, Madam, said I, I will make it plainer; for should I give it you as it came from Ptolomy its Author, or from some who have since study'd it, I should fright you, I fancy, instead of diverting you. Since the Motions of the Planets are not so regular, but that sometimes they go faster, sometimes slower, sometimes are nearer the Earth, and sometimes farther from it; the Ancients did invent I do not know how many Orbs or Circles involv'd one within another, which they thought would salve all Objections; this confusion of Circles was so great, that at that time when they knew no better, a certain King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but not much troubled with Religion, said, That had God consulted him when he made the World, he would have told him how to have fram'd it better. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">The fancy was very Atheistical,</span></span> and no doubt the Instructions he would have given the Almighty, was the suppressing those Circles with which they had clog'd the Celestial Motions, and the taking away two or three superfluous Heavens which they had placed above the fixed Stars; for these Philosophers to explain the Motion of the Celestial Bodies, had above the uppermost Heaven (which we see,) found another of Crystal, to influence and give Motion to the inferiour Heavens; and wherever they heard of another Motion, they presently clapp'd up a Crystal Heaven which cost 'em Page 17 nothing. But why must their Heaven be of Crystal, said the Countess, would nothing else serve as well? No, no, I reply'd, nothing so well; for the Light was to come thro' them, and yet they were to be solid. Aristotle would have it so, he had found Solidity to be one of their Excellencies, and when he had once said it, no body would be so rude as to question it. But it seems there were Comets much higher than the Philosophers expected, which as they pass'd along brake the Crystal Heavens, and confounded the Universe. But to make the best of a bad Market, they presently melt down their broken Glass, and to Aristotles Confusion, made the heavens fluid; and by the observations of these latter Ages it is now out of doubt, that Venus and Mercury turn round the Sun, and not round the Earth, according to the Antient Systeme, which is now every where exploded, and all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush. But that which I am going to lay down, will salve all, and is so clear, that the King of Arragon himself may spare his Advice. Methinks, saith the Countess, your Philosophy is a kind of Out-cry, where he that offers to do the work cheapest, carries it from all the rest. 'Tis very true, said I, Nature is a great Huswife, she always makes use of what costs least, let the difference be never so inconsiderable; and yet this frugality is accompany'd with an extraordinary magnificence, which shines thro' all her works; that is, she is magnificent in the design, but frugal in the Execution; and what can be more praise worthy, than a great design accomplish'd with a little Expence?

This specific ideological element, a nuanced religious and philosophical point suggesting that the old system's intellectual flaws could lead to sin, is entirely removed from the translation. It would have followed the translator's rendering of the preceding phrase ('La pensée est trop libertine') as 'The fancy was very Atheistical,'. This omission sanitizes the text by filtering out Fontenelle's subtle critique, likely due to the translator's caution in the religiously charged atmosphere of 1688 England, opting for a more straightforward condemnation of the King's sentiment rather than presenting Fontenelle's complex commentary on the theological implications of the old cosmology."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il? Avez-vous remarqué, lui répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? Elle va vers le but où elle est envoyée, &amp; en même temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-même, en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut. La Terre fait la même chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures. Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le côté où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse. Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la même cause. Les Planètes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nôtre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planètes marchent aussi; cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard, &amp; nous fait paroître dans leur cours des bizarreries dont il n'est pas nécessaire que je vous parle. Il suffit que vous sachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irrégulier dans les Planètes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont notre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fond elles sont toutes très-reglées. Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, on ne l'a guere ménagée, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité.. Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures. </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'un gros Navire monté de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">cent cinquante</span></span> pièces de Canon, chargé de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"1\">plus de trois mille</span></span> hommes, &amp; d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises? Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes. Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fût cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matière céleste, &amp; ne pas s'y laisser emporter? C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere. </p><p>P011: Mais, répliqua-t-elle encore, comment la Terre avec tout son poids se soûtient- elle sur votre matiere celeste qui doit être bien legere, puisqu'elle est si fluide? Ce n'est pas à dire, répondis-je, que ce qui est fluide, soit plus leger. Que dites-vous de notre gros Vaisseau, qui avec tout son poids est plus léger que l'eau, puisqu'il y surnage? Je ne veux plus vous dire rien, dit-elle comme en colere, tant que vous aurez le gros Vaisseau. Mais m'assurez-vous bien qu'il n'y ait rien à craindre sur une pirouette aussi legere que vous me faites la Terre? Eh bien, luy répondis-je, faisons porter la Terre par quatre Elephans, comme font les Indiens. Voicy bien un autre Système, s'écria-t-elle. Du moins j'aime ces Gens-là d'avoir pourveu à leur seureté, &amp; fait de bons fondemens, au lieu que nous autres Coperniciens, nous sommes assez inconsideres pour vouloir bien nager à l'aventure dans cette matiere celeste. Je gage que si les Indiens savoient que la Terre fût le moins du monde en peril de se mouvoir, ils doubleroient les Elephans. </p><p>P012: Cela le meriteroit bien, repris-je, en riant de sa pensée, il ne faut point s'épargner les Elephans pour dormir en assurance, &amp; si vous en avez besoin pour cette nuit, nous en mettrons dans notre systême autant qu'il vous plaira; ensuite nous les retrancherons peu à peu, à mesure que vous vous rassurerez. Serieusement, reprit-elle, je ne crois pas dés à present qu'ils me soient fort necessaires, &amp; je me sens assez de courage pour oser tourner. Vous irez bien-tost encore plus loin, répliquai-je, vous tournerez avec plaisir, &amp; vous vous ferez sur ce Systême des idées réjouissantes. Quelquefois, par exemple, je me figure que je suis suspendu en l'air, &amp; que j'y demeure sans mouvement pendant que la Terre tourne sous moy en vingt-quatre heures, &amp; que je vois passer sous mes yeux tous ces visages differens, les uns blancs, les autres noirs, les autres bazannez, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"2\">les autres olivâtres</span></span>, que je voy d'abord des Chapeaux, &amp; puis des Turbans, &amp; puis des têtes cheveluës, &amp; puis des Têtes rases; tantôt des Villes à clochers, tantôt des Villes à longues aiguilles qui ont des Croissants, tantôt des Villes à Tours de Porcelaine, tantôt de grands Païs qui n'ont que des Cabanes; icy, des vastes Mers; là des Deserts épouvantables; enfin toute cette variété infinie qui est sur la surface de la Terre. </p><p>P013: En verité, dit-elle, tout cela mériteroit bien que l'on donnât vingt-quatre heures de son temps à le voir. Ainsi donc dans le même lieu où nous sommes à present, je ne dis pas dans ce Parc, mais dans ce même lieu, à le prendre dans l'air, il y passe continuellement d'autres Peuples qui prennent notre place, &amp; au bout de vingt-quatre heures nous y revenons.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P007: I confess, said I, Madam, the footsteps of Lovers would better become this Place; that is, your Name and Cypher grav'd on the Trees by your Adorers. Tell not me, said she, of Lovers and Adorers, I am for my beloved Sun and Planets. But how comes it to pass that the Sun as to the fixed Stars compleats his course but in a year, and yet goes over our Heads every day? Did you never, I reply'd, observe a Bowl on a Bowling-green? It runs towards the Block, and at the same time turns very often round it self, so that the Parts which were above are below, and those which were below are above; just so it is with the Earth, at the same time that she advanceth on the Circle which in a years space she makes round the Sun, in twenty four hours she turns round her self; so that in twenty four hours every part of the Earth loseth the Sun, and recovers him again, and as it turns towards the Sun, it seems to rise, and as it turns from him, it seems to fall. It is very pleasant, said she, that the Earth must take all upon her self, and the Sun do nothing. And when the Moon, the other Planets, and the fix'd Stars seem to go over our Heads every twenty four hours, you'll say that too is only Fancy? Pure Fancy, said I, which proceeds from the same cause, for the Planets compleat their courses round the Sun at unequal times, according to their unequal distances, and that which we see to day answer to a certain Point in the Zodiack or Circle of the fix'd Stars, to morrow we see answer to another Point, because it is advanced on its own Circle as well as we are advanced upon ours. We move, and the Planets move too, which must make a great alteration; so that what seems irregular in the Planets, proceeds only from our motion, when in truth they are all very regular: I will suppose 'em so, said the Countess, but I would not have their Regularity put the Earth to so great trouble; methinks you exact too much Activity from so ponderous a Mass. But, said I, had you rather that the Sun and all the Stars, which are vast great Bodies, should in twenty four hours travel such an infinity of Miles, and make so prodigious a Tour as they needs must, if the Earth did not turn round it self every twenty four hours? Oh, said she, the Sun and the Stars are all Fire, their Motion is not very difficult; but the Earth, I fancy, is a little unweildy: That signifies nothing, I reply'd, for what do you think of a first rate Ship, which carries near an hundred Guns, and a thousand Men, beside her Provisions and other Furniture? you see one puff of Wind makes it sail on the Water, because the Water is liquid, and being easily separated doth very little resist the motion of the Ship: So the Earth tho' never so Massive is as easily born up by the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water, and fills all that great Space where the Planets float; for where would you the Earth should be fastned to resist the motion of the Celestial Matter, and not be driven by it? You may as well fancy a little block of Wood can withstand the current of a River. But pray, said she, how can the Earth with all its weight be born up by your Celestial Matter, which must be very light, because it is so fluid? It doth not argue, said I, that what is most fluid is most light: for what think you of the great Vessel I mention'd but now, which with all its Burthen is yet lighter than the Water it floats on? I will have nothing to do with that great Vessel, said she, and I begin to apprehend my self in some danger on such a whirlegigg as you have made of the Earth: There is no danger, I reply'd; but Madam, if you are afraid, we will have the Earth supported by four Elephants, as the Indians believe it. Hey day, cry'd she, here's another Systeme; however I love those People for taking care of themselves, they have a good Foundation to trust to, while you Copernicans are a little too venturous with the Celestial Matter; and yet I fancy if the Indians thought the Earth in the least danger of sinking, they would double their number of Elephants. They do well, said I, laughing at her fancy, who would sleep in Fear? and if you have occasion for 'em to night, we will put as many as you please in our Systeme, we can take 'em away again by degrees as you grow better confirm'd. I do not think 'em very necessary, said she, I have courage enough to turn. You shall turn with pleasure, Madam, said I, and shall find delightful Ideas in this Systeme. For Example, sometimes I fancy my self suspended in the Air, without any motion, while the Earth turns round me in twenty four hours; I see I know not how many different Faces pass under me, some white, some black, and some tauny; sometimes I see Hats, and sometimes Turbants, now Heads with Hair, and then shav'd Heads; here I see Cities with Steeples, others with Spires and Crescents, others with Towers of Purcelain, and anon great Countreys with nothing but Cottages; here. I see vast Oceans, and there most horrible Desarts; in short, I discover the infinite variety which is upon the surface of the Earth. I confess, said she, twenty four hours would thus be very well bestow'd, so that in the same Place where we are now, I do not mean in the Park, but we will suppose our selves in the Air, other People continually pass by who take up our Place, and at the end of twenty four hours we return to it again.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P007: I confess, said I, Madam, the footsteps of Lovers would better become this Place; that is, your Name and Cypher grav'd on the Trees by your Adorers.

And when the Moon, the other Planets, and the fix'd Stars seem to go over our Heads every twenty four hours, you'll say that too is only Fancy? Pure Fancy, said I, which proceeds from the same cause, for the Planets compleat their courses round the Sun at unequal times, according to their unequal distances, and that which we see to day answer to a certain Point in the Zodiack or Circle of the fix'd Stars, to morrow we see answer to another Point, because it is advanced on its own Circle as well as we are advanced upon ours. We move, and the Planets move too, which must make a great alteration; so that what seems irregular in the Planets, proceeds only from our motion, when in truth they are all very regular: I will suppose 'em so, said the Countess, but I would not have their Regularity put the Earth to so great trouble; methinks you exact too much Activity from so ponderous a Mass. But, said I, had you rather that the Sun and all the Stars, which are vast great Bodies, should in twenty four hours travel such an infinity of Miles, and make so prodigious a Tour as they needs must, if the Earth did not turn round it self every twenty four hours? Oh, said she, the Sun and the Stars are all Fire, their Motion is not very difficult; but the Earth, I fancy, is a little unweildy: That signifies nothing, I reply'd, for what do you think of a first rate Ship, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">which carries near an hundred Guns</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"1\">and a thousand Men</span></span>, beside her Provisions and other Furniture? you see one puff of Wind makes it sail on the Water, because the Water is liquid, and being easily separated doth very little resist the motion of the Ship: So the Earth tho' never so Massive is as easily born up by the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water, and fills all that great Space where the Planets float; for where would you the Earth should be fastned to resist the motion of the Celestial Matter, and not be driven by it? You may as well fancy a little block of Wood can withstand the current of a River. But pray, said she, how can the Earth with all its weight be born up by your Celestial Matter, which must be very light, because it is so fluid? It doth not argue, said I, that what is most fluid is most light: for what think you of the great Vessel I mention'd but now, which with all its Burthen is yet lighter than the Water it floats on? I will have nothing to do with that great Vessel, said she, and I begin to apprehend my self in some danger on such a whirlegigg as you have made of the Earth: There is no danger, I reply'd; but Madam, if you are afraid, we will have the Earth supported by four Elephants, as the Indians believe it. Hey day, cry'd she, here's another Systeme; however I love those People for taking care of themselves, they have a good Foundation to trust to, while you Copernicans are a little too venturous with the Celestial Matter; and yet I fancy if the Indians thought the Earth in the least danger of sinking, they would double their number of Elephants. They do well, said I, laughing at her fancy, who would sleep in Fear? and if you have occasion for 'em to night, we will put as many as you please in our Systeme, we can take 'em away again by degrees as you grow better confirm'd. I do not think 'em very necessary, said she, I have courage enough to turn. You shall turn with pleasure, Madam, said I, and shall find delightful Ideas in this Systeme. For Example, sometimes I fancy my self suspended in the Air, without any motion, while the Earth turns round me in twenty four hours; I see I know not how many different Faces pass under me, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"2\">some white, some black, and some tauny</span></span>; sometimes I see Hats, and sometimes Turbants, now Heads with Hair, and then shav'd Heads; here I see Cities with Steeples, others with Spires and Crescents, others with Towers of Purcelain, and anon great Countreys with nothing but Cottages; here. I see vast Oceans, and there most horrible Desarts; in short, I discover the infinite variety which is upon the surface of the Earth. I confess, said she, twenty four hours would thus be very well bestow'd, so that in the same Place where we are now, I do not mean in the Park, but we will suppose our selves in the Air, other People continually pass by who take up our Place, and at the end of twenty four hours we return to it again.</p>","explanations":["The source text specifies 'cent cinquante pièces de Canon' (150 cannons). The translator changed this to 'near an hundred Guns,' significantly reducing the number. This downscaling of the warship's armament, part of an analogy for the Earth's movement, could be self-censorship to make a potentially French-conceived example of power less imposing to an English audience during a period of Anglo-French rivalry, thereby sanitizing a politically sensitive depiction of military capability.","The source text states the ship is 'chargé de plus de trois mille hommes' (carrying more than 3000 men). The translator reduced this to 'a thousand Men.' This substantial reduction in crew size, along with the reduction in cannons, serves to diminish the described ship's scale and power. This alteration can be seen as self-censorship aimed at mitigating any impression of (French) naval strength that might be unpalatable or politically sensitive for the English readership of the time, effectively filtering out the original larger figure.","Fontenelle's philosopher describes seeing diverse human faces: 'les uns blancs, les autres noirs, les autres bazannez, les autres olivâtres' (some white, others black, others swarthy/tanned, others olive-skinned). The translation omits 'les autres olivâtres,' listing only 'some white, some black, and some tauny.' This omission filters out a specific category of human complexion, thereby reducing the scope of human diversity presented by Fontenelle. This can be considered cultural self-censorship, simplifying the global human variety or avoiding reference to specific populaces associated with that skin tone, subtly sanitizing the breadth of Fontenelle's Enlightenment-era depiction of humanity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.

This entire depiction of a specific, non-Christian religious practice is omitted from the English translation. Given the religious tensions in England in 1687, with strong anti-Catholic sentiments and controversies surrounding James II's Declaration of Indulgence, this description of a seemingly idolatrous or 'exotic' religious figure and worship could have been deemed too sensitive or potentially offensive to Protestant readers, or might have drawn unwelcome parallels to aspects of Catholic worship or priestly authority. The omission serves to sanitize the text of potentially controversial religious content.","The Marquise's original reflection in French is 'qu'il est ridicule d'être sur quelque chose qui tourne, & de se tourmenter tant' (it is ridiculous to be on something that turns, and to torment oneself so much). The phrase '& de se tourmenter tant,' which offers a philosophical critique on the vanity of human anxieties and worldly efforts when seen from a cosmic perspective, is omitted. The English translation instead reads, ''tis very ridiculous to be upon a thing that turns, and yet not be well assur'd that it doth turn'. This omission filters out the critical philosophical reflection on human nature and preoccupations, possibly to avoid unsettling the reader with ideas that diminish the importance of human affairs or to sidestep a potentially challenging perspective on human existence during a period of social and political unrest.","The source text concludes its list of diverse human activities with a self-referential comment by the philosopher about himself and the Marquise: 'enfin, nous qui debiterons peut-être encore des rêveries' (finally, we who will perhaps still be spouting fantasies/speculations). This implies their philosophical discussions (the content of the book itself) might be considered 'rêveries.' This specific, self-aware, and potentially ironic characterization of their intellectual endeavor is entirely omitted. The translation replaces it with a general observation: 'and at last our own dear Countrymen, it may be in some points as ridiculous as the best of 'em.' This omission removes Fontenelle's own nuanced framing of his potentially controversial scientific and philosophical ideas. The translator might have censored this to avoid the work being easily dismissed or to prevent the direct association of the book's speculative content with the loaded term 'rêveries,' especially in a cultural context where new scientific ideas challenged established orthodoxy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P018: Les mouvements les plus naturels, répondis-je, &amp; les plus ordinaires, sont ceux qui se font le moins sentir, &amp; cela est vray jusque dans la Morale.

This comment was likely omitted due to self-censorship. In the English socio-religious context of 1687, characterized by heightened religious tensions between Protestants and Catholics, the controversial Declaration of Indulgence, and the influence of the High Church Anglican movement emphasizing tradition and decorum, such a flippant critique of \"moralizing\" could have been deemed problematic. Moralizing about new scientific ideas was often linked to attempts by religious authorities to control or interpret these ideas within established theological frameworks. The Marquise's dismissive remark could be seen as subtly challenging this practice. Omitting the phrase softens the Marquise's criticism, removes its irreverent tone, and avoids potential offense to sensibilities that valued a more serious or deferential approach to moral dimensions in philosophical and scientific discourse. This results in the target text being ideologically sanitized by removing an expression of impatience with such moralizing, which was in line with the emerging Enlightenment spirit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: En retournant au Château je luy dis pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes, qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Tycho Brahé qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fût immobile, la plaçoit au centre du Monde, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planètes, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planètes autour de la Terre.

This critical qualification, highlighting that adherence to the system was based on pre-existing desire or bias rather than its persuasive power, is omitted. The English translation simplifies the Marquise's complex critique of the system's utility to 'tho' this Systeme was to prove the immobility of the Earth,' thereby removing the ideological point about clinging to scientifically weaker theories due to personal conviction or prejudice. This sanitization likely aimed to avoid controversy related to questioning the motivations behind established beliefs, which could be sensitive in the religious context of 1687 England where traditional views were strongly defended.","The French text describes Copernicus's system as having '& n'a aucun mélange de préjugé' (and has no mixture of prejudice).

The description of Copernicus's opinion ends with 'Diverting.' The term 'préjugé' (prejudice) would have been a direct challenge to traditional, often religiously-backed, views of the cosmos.

The translator omitted this second consequential behavior. In the politically turbulent environment of England around 1687, with the recent memory of the English Civil War and ongoing deep political divisions under James II, this specific description of pragmatic, cautious, and potentially compromising dealings even with declared enemies could have been perceived as ideologically sensitive or too politically pointed. Omitting it simplifies the analogy Fontenelle uses and removes a layer of complex political behavior, thereby sanitizing the text of this subtle political commentary that might have resonated uncomfortably with contemporary English readers.","The source text states the philosopher is ready 'de me pouvoir ranger à leur opinion avec honneur, si elle avoit le dessus' (to be able to rally to their opinion with honor, if it gained the upper hand). The translator renders the core idea as being 'still ready to embrace the prevailing Opinion', but omits 'avec honneur' (with honor). This omission is significant because the translator contemporaneously inserts the parenthetical remark '(as some honest Gentlemen in point of Religion)' immediately before this phrase, directly linking the act of changing opinions to religious conformity. In the context of late 17th-century England, characterized by intense religious strife (James II's Catholicism, the Declaration of Indulgence, and widespread Protestant anxiety), the assertion that one could switch religious or ideological allegiances 'with honor' was potentially explosive. Removing 'avec honneur' strips away this moral justification, making the act of conformity appear more as pure pragmatism. This filters out an ideologically sensitive claim that might have been contentious or offensive to various factions in the religiously charged atmosphere, thereby sanitizing the text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P022: Suposons qu'il n'y ait jamais eu nul commerce entre Paris &amp; Saint-Denis, &amp; qu'un Bourgeois de Paris, qui ne sera jamais sorty de sa Ville, soit sur les Tours de Notre Dame, &amp; voye Saint-Denis de loin; on luy demandera s'il croit que Saint-Denis soit habité comme Paris.

Its omission in the translation simplifies the scientific explanation. Given the religious tensions and reactions to emerging scientific rationalism in late 17th-century England, removing such details of celestial mechanics could be a form of self-censorship, reducing the text's assertiveness in presenting a naturalistic worldview and thus sanitizing it for an audience wary of challenges to traditional orthodoxy.","The phrase 'Il faut necessairement que' (It must necessarily be that), emphasizing the deterministic nature of celestial mechanics, is omitted from the translation. In a context where the idea of a universe governed by natural laws (potentially excluding constant divine intervention) was contentious, removing 'necessairement' (necessarily) softens this deterministic assertion. This self-censorship likely aimed to make the text less challenging to theological views emphasizing divine agency over purely natural necessity in cosmic operations, thereby ideologically sanitizing the passage.","The source text mentions a reflected ball losing 'force & de vitesse' (force and speed), in an analogy applied to light. The English translation omits '& de vitesse' (and speed), stating only that the ball has 'less force' before mentioning light is 'weakned'. The nature of light, including its speed, was a sensitive scientific and philosophical topic, with light often holding divine connotations in the 17th century. Omitting 'vitesse' (speed) avoids a specific physical claim about light that could be seen as overly materialistic or controversial.

The English translation replaces this assertive opening with the more passive 'I comprehend you very well,' thereby omitting her claim to independent reasoning and her confident manner. This alteration significantly tones down the Marquise's assertiveness and intellectual autonomy, which were key aspects of Fontenelle's progressive portrayal of a woman engaging with science. This omission likely constitutes self-censorship to align the female character more closely with the conventional, less intellectually challenging, expectations for women in late 17th-century English society, where such overt female intellectual confidence might have been considered controversial or inappropriate.","This omitted sentence from the source text ('I wouldn't want to be reproached for having had such an easy thing explained to me at length.') further emphasizes the Marquise's intellectual confidence and pride. She expresses that the matter is 'so easy' ('si aisée') for her and implies she grasps concepts quickly without needing lengthy explanations. By removing this statement, the translator again diminishes the portrayal of her sharp intelligence and self-assuredness. This form of self-censorship contributes to presenting a more subdued and conventionally feminine character, possibly to avoid challenging prevailing societal norms in England regarding women's intellectual capacities and their expected demeanor, especially in discussions of scientific topics, which were traditionally male domains."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P028: Je suis fort étonnée, dit la Marquise, qu'il y ait si peu de mystere aux Eclipses, &amp; que tout le monde n'en devine pas la cause.

This omission likely constitutes self-censorship due to the heightened religious sensitivities in England during James II's reign (1685-1688). The translator may have deliberately removed this common French idiom invoking God to avoid any potential misinterpretation, perceived irreverence, or theological controversy when discussing the 'superstitious' practices of indigenous Americans, thereby sanitizing the text for a predominantly Protestant and religiously tense English audience.","The source phrase \"les Philosophes qui écrivent pour nous rassurer, n'écrivirent ils pas en vain?\" (and the Philosophers who write to reassure us, did they not write in vain?), which follows \"&\" at the end of the paragraph, is omitted in the target text. In its place, after \"and \", the translator has substituted \"all the Philosophers of Gresham could not perswade them to come out till the Eclipse was over?\". Fontenelle's original phrase offers a general and somewhat pessimistic reflection on the ineffectiveness of philosophical and scientific *writings* in calming popular fears, a subtle critique of the limits of the Enlightenment project itself. This omission and replacement filters out this broader, ideologically nuanced point. This likely represents self-censorship to avoid a potentially undermining message about the efficacy of reason and written discourse in an English context where scientific knowledge (e.g., from Gresham College/Royal Society) was being actively promoted. The substitution localizes the failure to a specific group and action, making the critique less universal and less focused on the limitations of the written dissemination of knowledge, which Fontenelle's own book exemplified."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P029: En vérité, reprit-elle, tout cela est trop honteux pour les hommes, il devrait y avoir un Arrêt du Genre humain, qui défendît qu'on parlât jamais d'Eclipses, de peur que l'on ne conserve la memoire des sotises qui ont été faites ou dites sur ce Chapitre là.

This statement itself borders on parodying religious adoration. The philosopher's laughter would underscore a mocking or irreverent stance towards such acts of worship. In the religiously charged atmosphere of late 17th-century England (1687), characterized by tensions between Catholics and Protestants, and efforts by religious authorities to reinforce theological orthodoxy against emerging scientific ideas, such open irreverence or mockery, especially tied to the physical act of 'kneeling' common in Christian worship, could be deemed highly offensive. Removing the laughter serves to sanitize the text by making the philosopher's potentially controversial statement sound more like a neutral or serious philosophical speculation rather than a pointed piece of ridicule, thereby mitigating its potential to offend prevailing religious sensibilities."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P031: Ne craignez rien, répondis-je, il n'y a pas d'apparence que nous soyons la seule sotte <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">espèce</span></span> de l'Univers.

The English translation renders this as 'the only Fools of the Universe.' The omission of 'espèce' (species) is significant. In a work popularizing the idea of life on other planets, the term 'species' has direct scientific and philosophical implications, potentially challenging the unique status of humankind as God's special creation and the established hierarchy of beings. By translating 'sotte espèce' to the more general 'Fools,' the translator avoids the term 'species,' thereby softening the natural philosophical assertion and making the text less confrontational towards prevailing religious views on creation and the hierarchy of beings during a period of heightened religious conservatism. This constitutes an ideological sanitization.","The intensifier 'très' (very), which modifies 'hautes' (high) in the source phrase 'de très hautes Montagnes' (of very high Mountains), is omitted in the English translation 'of high Mountains.' This omission lessens the described grandeur of lunar mountains. In the historical context of 1688 England, characterized by religious tensions and sensitivity towards scientific ideas that could diminish Earth's perceived uniqueness in the cosmos, this reduction serves as a subtle ideological sanitization. By downplaying the impressiveness of extraterrestrial features, the translator may have aimed to make the text less provocative to orthodox religious views.","The intensifier 'très' (very), which modifies 'profonds' (deep) in the source phrase 'des Abîmes très profonds' (very deep Abysses), is omitted in the English translation 'deep Abysses.' Similar to the omission of 'très' in the description of lunar mountains, this reduces the depicted extremity of lunar abysses. This toning down of the description can be interpreted as an act of self-censorship. In a climate where new scientific portrayals of the universe could conflict with entrenched theological doctrines, particularly those affirming Earth's special status, rendering lunar features less extraordinary would make Fontenelle's challenging ideas more palatable and less threatening to religious orthodoxy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P033: Vous me surprenez, reprit-elle.

The translation \"Nay, they pretend to be so well acquainted\" significantly alters this by introducing an element of doubt or skepticism (\"pretend\"). This change could be a form of self-censorship, as it downplays the confidence and authority of the scientific claims being presented. In an era where new scientific ideas could be controversial and challenge established beliefs, framing these claims as 'pretensions' rather than established knowledge would make them less assertive and potentially less offensive to traditional viewpoints, thus ideologically sanitizing the text.","The omission of \"& ce sont presque tous noms de Savants\" (and they are almost all names of Scientists/Scholars) from the end of the sentence downplays the act of naming lunar features as a scientific endeavor dominated by figures of the new learning. In an era where scientific claims could be controversial and challenge traditional authorities (including religious ones), removing the explicit mention of \"Savants\" as the source of these names could be a way to make the text less assertive about the authority and reach of science and its proponents. It subtly mutes the celebration of these scientific figures, potentially to avoid antagonizing those wary of the growing influence of 'Savants'.","Replacing \"un Savant\" (a Scientist/Scholar) with \"a very Almanack-maker\" is a significant substitution. A \"Savant\" in Fontenelle's context represents the cutting edge of the Scientific Revolution, figures whose ideas were transformative and often controversial. An \"Almanack-maker,\" while dealing with astronomical data, was a more familiar and less intellectually disruptive figure. This change might have been made to render the capabilities attributed to scientific knowledge less directly challenging to established intellectual or religious hierarchies. It domesticates the power of scientific understanding by attributing it to a more common and less potentially threatening type of learned person, thereby sanitizing the text by replacing a representative of the controversial new science with a more traditional figure."]},{"sourceHtml":"P034: Mais, reprit- elle, je serois bien aise de savoir encore plus en détail comment est fait le dedans du pays.

The Poem is dedicated to a Cardinal, and a great Pope hath honour'd it with his Approbation, which is prefix'd to several of the Editions; this is the Argument, Rowland Nephew to Charlemagne, falls mad because the fair Angelica prefers Medore before him. Astolfo a Knight Errant, finding himself one day in the terrestrial Paradise, which was upon the top of a very high Mountain, whereto he was carry'd by his flying Horse, meets St. John there, who tells him, if he would have Rowland cured, he must make a Voyage with him into the Moon. Astolfo, who had a great mind to see Countrys, did not stand much upon entreaty, and immediately there came a fiery Chariot which carry'd the Apostle and the Knight up into the Air; Astolfo being no great Philosopher, was surpriz'd to find the Moon so much bigger than it appear'd to him when he was upon the Earth; to see Rivers, Seas, Mountains, Cities, Forrests, nay, what would have surpriz'd me too, Nymphs hunting in those Forrests; but that which was most remarkable, was a Valley where you might find any thing that was lost in our World, of what nature soever; Crowns, Riches, Fame, and an infinity of Hopes, the time we spend in Play, and in searching for the Philosophers Stone, the Alms we give after our Death, the Verses we present to great Men and Princes, and the Sighs of Lovers. I know not, said she, what became of the Sighs of Lovers in the time of Ariosto, but I fancy there are very few of 'em ascend to the Moon in our days. Ah Madam, I reply'd, how many doth the Countess of D-r send thither every day? those that are address'd to her, will make a considerable Heap; and I assure you the Moon keeps all safe that is lost here below. Yet I must tell you Ariosto doth but whisper it, tho' every thing is there, even to the donation of Constantine, (i. e.) the Popes have pretended to be Masters of Rome and Italy by Virtue of a Donation which the Emperour Constantine made Silvester; and the truth is, no body knows what is become of it; but what do you think is not to be found in the Moon? Folly, all that ever was upon the Earth is kept there still, but in lieu of it, it is not to be imagin'd how many Wits (if I may so call 'em) that are lost here, are got up into the Moon, they are so many Vials full of a very subtile Liquor, which evaporates immediately if it be not well stopp'd; and upon every one of these Vials the Names are written to whom the Wits belong; I think Ariosto hath heap'd 'em upon one another a little confusedly, but for order sake we will fancy 'em plac'd upon Shelves in a long Gallery; Astolfo wonder'd to see several Vials full inscribed with the Names of the most considerable Statsemen, Divines, Lawyers, &amp;c. Bless me, said he, is my Lord- and my Lord- here! Sir Tho. Sir Jo. nay, Doctor - and Father - too? Why, in my Countrey, we look upon 'em as Oracles; and after all, it seems, they are but little better than mad Men, if not stark Fools. I find now the poor Rogue was in the right, tho' he was soundly whipp'd for't, who told the Judge that he had seen an Ass cloathed in Scarlet; and a right Worshipful Alderman, that he knew not which was the greatest Bruit of the two, the Beast that bore the Furr, or the Beast that wore it; but had I been there, I should have told Astolfo the saucy Knave was well enough serv'd, for we are not to look upon the Man, but the Place he fills; we are to reverence a Magistrate when and wheresoever we meet him, and to suppose his Merit was the sole cause of his Preferment, tho' we are certain it came by Bribery or Pimping; but enough of this, let us return to our Vials.

N'y eût-il que vous, Madame, repris-je en badinant, vous y avez fait aller tous ceux qu'on vous a adressez, & c'est dequoy faire dans la Lune un amas considerable. Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin. C'est que les Papes ont prétendu être Maîtres de Rome & de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, & la verité est qu'on ne sauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë. Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie. Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres bien conservé. En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus. Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, & qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, & sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, & pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune. Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, & reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, & qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà. Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, & il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, & lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, & si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, & qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, & on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut. En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne. Mais pour achever de m'ôter le mien, dites-moy, & dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune; car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une manière assez positive. Moi, repris- je. Je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune. Voyez combien la face de la Nature est changée d'icy à la Chine; d'autres Visages, d'autres Figures, d'autres Moeurs, & presque d'autres Principes de raisonnement. D'icy à la Lune le changement doit être bien plus considerable. Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine; qui pourrait pousser jusqu'à la Lune, assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit.","manualHtml":"<p>P023: Page 55-The love of one fair Northern Lass, Sent up his wit unto the Place it was.</p> <p>P024: Well, he did not forget Orlando's Vial, which was the occasion of his Voyage, but he was cursedly plagu'd to carry it, for Hero's wits are naturally very heavy, and there did not want one drop of it; in conclusion Ariosto, according to his laudable custom, addresseth himself to his Mistress in this manner,</p> <p>P025: Fair Mistress, who for me to Heav'n shall fly, To bring again from thence my wandring wit?

This phrase is part of a list of human paradoxes. In the specific historical and cultural context of late 17th-century England, where religious authorities were keen to reinforce theological orthodoxy, especially during the turbulent reign of James II and the rise of Enlightenment ideas, such a direct contemplation on the brevity of human life without an accompanying religious consolation could be deemed ideologically sensitive. The translator may have deliberately omitted this element to avoid evoking potentially unsettling existential thoughts that could be perceived as challenging or undermining traditional religious frameworks concerning life's purpose and divine providence. This omission sanitizes the text by removing a philosophically poignant, potentially melancholic observation about the human condition, aligning with a cautious approach in a period of religious and political sensitivity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">six mille ans</span></span>, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves.

You would laugh at me, said I, if I should answer you seriously, perhaps I may deserve it, and yet, I fancy, I can say a great deal to justifie a ridiculous thought that is just now come into my Head; nay to use the Fools best Argument, I'll lay a wager I make you own (in spite of Reason) that one of these days there may be a Communication between the Earth and the Moon, and who knows what great Advantages we may procure by it?

So that (except when they were on the Land) it might be said they were continually swimming: And yet had any one but told 'em of another kind of Navigation incomparably more perfect and useful than their own, that they might easily pass over that infinite Space of Water, that they might stop in the middle of the Waves, and in some sense command the Winds, and make their Vessel go fast or slow as they pleas'd; in short, that this impassable Ocean should be no obstacle to their conversing with another different People; do you think they would have believed you? and yet at last that day is come; the unheard of and most surprizing Sight appears, vast great Bodies, with white Wings, are seen to fly upon the Sea, to vomit Fire from all Parts, and to cast on their Shoars an unknown People, all scaled with Iron, who dispose and govern Monsters as they please; carry Thunder in their Hands, and overthrow and destroy whoever resists 'em: From whence came they? Who brought 'em over the Sea? Who gave to 'em the Disposal of the Fire of Heaven? Are they Gods? Are they Sons of the Sun? for certainly they are not Men. Do but consider, Madam, the surprize of the Americans, there can be nothing greater; and after this, shall any one say there shall never be a Communication between the Moon and the Earth. Did the Americans believe there would ever be any between them and Europe, till it came to pass? 'Tis true, you must pass this great Space of Air and Heaven which is between the Earth and the Moon; but did not those vast Seas seem at first as impassable to the Americans? You rave, I think, said she, did you not own the Americans were so ignorant, that they had not the least conception of crossing the Sea; but we who know a great deal more then they, can imagine and fancy the going through the Air, tho' we are assur'd it is not to be done. There is somewhat more than Fancy, I reply'd, when it hath been already practis'd, for several have found the secret of fastning Wings, which bear them up in the Air, to move them as they please, and to fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple; I cannot say indeed they have yet made an Eagles Flight, or that it doth not cost now and then a Leg or an Arm to one of these new Birds; but this may serve to represent the first Planks that were launch'd on the Water, and which were the very beginning of Navigation; there were no Vessels then thought of to sail round the World, and yet you see what great Ships are grown by little and little from those first Planks. The Art of Flying is but newly invented, it will improve by degrees, and in time grow perfect; then we may fly as far as the Moon. We do not yet pretend to have discover'd all things, or that what we have discover'd can receive no addition; and therefore, pray let us agree, there are yet many things to be done in the Ages to come. Were you to live a thousand Ages, said the Countess, I can never believe you will fly, but you must endanger your Neck. I will not, I reply'd, be so unmannerly as to contradict a fair Lady, but tho' we cannot learn the Art here, I hope you will allow they may fly better in the Moon; 'tis no great matter whether we go to them, or they come to us, we shall then be the Americans, who knew nothing of Navigation, and yet there were very good Ships at t' other end of the World.

In the late 17th century, chronologies of the world were ideologically sensitive, particularly concerning the age of the Earth and humanity, often linked to Biblical interpretations like the Ussher chronology (placing Creation c. 4004 BC, making the world roughly 6000 years old). Fontenelle's specific 'six mille ans' could be interpreted as an engagement with these ongoing debates. The translator's alteration to the vaguer 'some thousands of years' sanitizes the text by avoiding a precise figure that might provoke controversy or be seen as directly aligning with or challenging specific theological timelines, thus making it less contentious for an English audience during a period of religious tension and emphasis on orthodoxy.","The translator omitted the phrase 'qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois' (meaning 'that it seems one only remembers it, when one learns it for the first time'), which expresses the Platonic concept of anamnesis (knowledge as recollection). This philosophical idea, suggesting innate knowledge or the pre-existence of the soul, could conflict with dominant Christian theological views on the soul's creation and the acquisition of knowledge (e.g., through revelation or empirical experience, rather than pre-natal awareness). Instead of translating this phrase, which would have followed 'it enters naturally into our Understanding;', the translator substituted 'and when once we have learn'd it, we do nothing but think of it.' This omission and replacement filters out a philosophical concept with potentially challenging religious implications, thereby sanitizing the text for an audience in a period where religious authorities were keen on reinforcing theological orthodoxy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">Particularités du monde de la Lune.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P029: The Third Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P029: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">The Third Evening.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The omission of 'Particularités du monde de la Lune.'

In the English socio-political and religious context of 1688, marked by tensions between Catholics and Protestants and a concern for orthodoxy, removing this direct and potentially provocative reference from the chapter heading could be an act of self-censorship to downplay the radical nature of the book's claims and avoid potential controversy or religious backlash."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P039: La Marquise voulut megager pendant le jour à poursuivre nos Entretiens, mais je luy representay que nous ne devions confier nos chimeres qu'à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles, puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet.

Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voilà le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">il est permis de</span></span> ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune; conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"1\">&amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé</span></span>; mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance. Cela nous fournira des fruits, des blés, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons.

I cannot suffer it, said she; yesterday you were preparing me to receive a Visit from 'em, and now there are no such People in Nature: Once you would have me believe the Moon was inhabited; I surmounted the Difficulty I had, and will now believe it. You are a little too nimble, I reply'd; did I not advise you never to be entirely convinc'd in things of this nature, but to reserve half of your understanding free and disengag'd, that you may admit of the contrary opinion, if there be any occasion. I care not for your Sentences, said she, let us come to matter of Fact. Are we not to consider the Moon as Greenwhich? No, said I, the Moon doth not so much resemble the Earth, as Greenwich doth London: The Sun draws from the Earth and Water, Exhalations and Vapours, which mounting to a certain height in the Air, do there assemble, and form the Clouds; these uncertain Clouds are driven irregularly round the Globe, sometimes shadowing one Countrey, and sometimes another; he then who beholds the Earth from a-far off, will see frequent alterations upon its surface, because a great Country overcast with Clouds, will appear dark or light, as the Clouds stay, or pass over it; he will see the Spots on the Earth often change their Place, and appear, or disappear as the Clouds remove; but we see none of these changes wrought upon the Moon, which would certainly be the same, were there but Clouds about her; but on the contrary, all her Spots are fix'd and certain, and her light parts continue where they were at first, which truly is a great misfortune; for by this reason, the Sun draws no Exhalations or Vapours above the Moon; so that it appears she is a Body infinitely more hard, and solid than the Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upwards as soon as Heat puts them in Motion: But it must be a heap of Rock and Marble, where there is no Evaporation; besides, Exhalations are so natural and necessary where there is Water, that there can be no Water at all, where there is no Exhalation; and what sort of Inhabitants must those be, whose Countrey affords no Water, is all Rock, and produceth nothing? Very fine, said she, you have forgot since, you assur'd me, we might from hence distinguish Seas in the Moon; nay, You or your Friends were Godfathers to some of 'em. Pray, what is become of your Caspian Sea, and your Black Lake? All Conjecture, Madam, I reply'd, tho' for your Ladyships sake, I am very sorry for it; for those dark places we took to be Seas, may perhaps be nothing but large Cavities; 'tis hard to guess aright at so great a distance. But will this suffice then, said she, to extirpate the People in the Moon? Not altogether, I reply'd, we will neither determine for, nor against them. I must own my weakness (if it be one) said she, I cannot be so perfectly undetermin'd as you would have me to be, but must believe one way, or the other; therefore pray fix me quickly in my opinion; as to the Inhabitants of the Moon; preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit; and yet methinks I have a strange inclination for 'em, and would not have 'em destroy'd, if it were possible to save 'em. You know, Madam, said I, I can deny you nothing; the Moon shall be no longer a Defart, but to do you service, we will repeople her. Since to all appearance, the Spots in the Moon do not change, I cannot conceive there are any Clouds about her, that sometimes obscure one part, and sometimes another; yet this doth not hinder, but that the Moon sends forth Exhalations, and Vapours. Our Clouds which we see in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their coming out of the Earth, were separated into such minute Particles, that they could not be discern'd; but as they ascend higher, they are condens'd by the Cold, and by the re- union of their Parts, are render'd visible; after which they become great Clouds, which fluctuate in the Air, till they return back again in Rain; however these Exhalations and Vapours do sometimes keep themselves so dispers'd, that they are imperceptible; or if they do assemble, it is in forming such subtile Dews, that they cannot be discern'd to fall from any Cloud. It may likewise happen, that the Vapours which go out of the Moon (for it is incredible that the Moon is such a Mass, that all its Parts are of an equal Solidity, all at rest one with another, and all incapable of any alteration from the efficacy of the Sun; I am sure we are yet unacquainted with such a Body: Marble it self is of another Nature, and even that which is most Solid, is subject to Change and Alteration; either from the secret and invisible motion it hath within it self, or from that which it receives from without) it may so happen then, that the Vapours which issue from the Moon, may not assemble round her in Clouds, and may not fall back again in Rain, but only in Dews. It is sufficient for this, that the Air with which the Moon is environ'd, (for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth) be a little different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon a little different from those of the Earth, which is very probable. Hereupon the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than on the Earth, the Effects must be different; tho' it is of no great consequence whether they are or no; for from the moment we have found an inward motion in the parts of the Moon, or produced by foreign Causes, here is enough for the new birth of its Inhabitants, and a sufficient and necessary fund for their Subsistence. This will furnish us with Corn, Fruit, Water, according to the custom or manner of the Moon, which I do not pretend to know; and all proportion'd to the wants and use of the Inhabitants, with whom I pretend to be as little acquainted. That is to say, reply'd the Countess, you know all is very well, without knowing how it is so, which is a great deal of Ignorance upon a very little Knowledge; however I comfort my self, that you have given the Moon her Inhabitants again, and have wrap'd her in an Air of her own, without which a Planet would seem but very naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: Well, Madam, said I, I have great News for you; that which I told you last Night, of the Moon's being inhabited, may not be so now: There is a new Fancy got into my Head, which puts those People in great Danger. I cannot suffer it, said she; yesterday you were preparing me to receive a Visit from 'em, and now there are no such People in Nature: Once you would have me believe the Moon was inhabited; I surmounted the Difficulty I had, and will now believe it. You are a little too nimble, I reply'd; did I not advise you never to be entirely convinc'd in things of this nature, but to reserve half of your understanding free and disengag'd, that you may admit of the contrary opinion, if there be any occasion. I care not for your Sentences, said she, let us come to matter of Fact. Are we not to consider the Moon as Greenwhich? No, said I, the Moon doth not so much resemble the Earth, as Greenwich doth London: The Sun draws from the Earth and Water, Exhalations and Vapours, which mounting to a certain height in the Air, do there assemble, and form the Clouds; these uncertain Clouds are driven irregularly round the Globe, sometimes shadowing one Countrey, and sometimes another; he then who beholds the Earth from a-far off, will see frequent alterations upon its surface, because a great Country overcast with Clouds, will appear dark or light, as the Clouds stay, or pass over it; he will see the Spots on the Earth often change their Place, and appear, or disappear as the Clouds remove; but we see none of these changes wrought upon the Moon, which would certainly be the same, were there but Clouds about her; but on the contrary, all her Spots are fix'd and certain, and her light parts continue where they were at first, which truly is a great misfortune; for by this reason, the Sun draws no Exhalations or Vapours above the Moon; so that it appears she is a Body infinitely more hard, and solid than the Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upwards as soon as Heat puts them in Motion: But it must be a heap of Rock and Marble, where there is no Evaporation; besides, Exhalations are so natural and necessary where there is Water, that there can be no Water at all, where there is no Exhalation; and what sort of Inhabitants must those be, whose Countrey affords no Water, is all Rock, and produceth nothing?

The translation renders this as ''tis hard to guess aright at so great a distance.' The specific French segment 'il est permis de' (it is permitted to/one is allowed to) is omitted. This omission removes the explicit philosophical endorsement of epistemological humility and the allowance for error, which is a key aspect of the scientific mindset Fontenelle promotes. Changing the statement from a normative one about the scientific process (error is permissible and expected) to a merely descriptive one (guessing is difficult) filters out an ideologically significant element. This might have been done to avoid overtly sanctioning fallibility, which could be seen as undermining authoritative claims to truth, a sensitive issue in a period balancing scientific inquiry with established religious and political orthodoxies.","The source text has the Marquise saying, 'conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais & qu'il n'en soit plus parlé' (let's keep them, or annihilate them forever and let no more be said of them). The translation is 'preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit'. The segment '& qu'il n'en soit plus parlé' (and let no more be said of them / let them never be spoken of again) is entirely omitted. This clause expresses the Marquise's desire for the complete suppression of any further discussion about the inhabitants of the Moon if they are deemed non-existent. This reflects an intolerance for ambiguity and a wish to control or silence discourse on a potentially unsettling topic. Omitting this phrase softens the Marquise's somewhat authoritarian stance on knowledge and discussion, making her character less confrontational towards the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of open inquiry. In the politically and religiously charged English context of the 1680s, portraying a character advocating for such complete silencing of a topic, even hypothetically, might have been deemed too sensitive."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empêcher la communication des deux Planetes.

This toning down of overt emotional display could be a deliberate cultural filtering to align the character with English norms of female decorum in the late 17th century, thereby sanitizing the original's more effusive French portrayal which might be considered unladylike.","The verb \"s'écria\" (exclaimed) is effectively replaced by the more neutral \"said.\" This change diminishes the intensity and spontaneity of the Marquise's (Countess's) utterance. Reducing the force of her exclamation serves to present her as more composed, possibly to fit English cultural expectations of aristocratic female behavior and decorum, thus ideologically sanitizing the character's expressive freedom as depicted in the French original.","The French phrase \"bon nombre de ces Gens-là\" (a good number of these People/aliens) emphasizes a significant quantity. The English translation, within \"how pleasant would it be to see 'em lie scatter'd on the ground,\", refers to the aliens as \"'em\" but omits the explicit quantifier \"bon nombre de\" (a good number of). This omission potentially diminishes the perceived scale of the imagined alien presence. In an era where the concept of a universe teeming with life challenged religious orthodoxy and traditional views of humanity's uniqueness, downplaying the *number* of such beings could be a deliberate act of self-censorship to make the idea less radical or overwhelming for the English audience.","The omission of \"en riant\" (laughing) from the Marquise's (Countess's) reply (\"répondit-elle en riant\") removes her light-hearted, perhaps even cavalier, demeanor when discussing the prospect of being \"fished\" by aliens. Fontenelle often used such levity to make controversial ideas more palatable. Removing the laughter makes the Countess's reaction more sober. In the English socio-religious context of the 1680s, with heightened religious sensitivities, overtly light-hearted treatment of speculative ideas about alien life, which touched on sensitive theological issues, might be perceived as inappropriate or disrespectful. This omission sanitizes the tone of the dialogue, possibly to avoid offending conservative sensibilities by removing what could be seen as undue levity concerning a serious philosophical topic."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P044: Songez, répliquai-je, que vous n'arriveriez que bien malade au haut de notre Air, il n'est pas respirable pour nous dans toute son étenduê, il s'en faut bien, il ne l'est déjà presque plus au haut de certaines Montagnes, &amp; je m'étonne bien que ceux qui ont la folie de croire que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">des Genies corporels</span></span> habitent l'air le plus pur, ne disent aussi que ce qui fait que ces Genies ne nous rendent que des visites &amp; tres-rares &amp; très-courtes, c'est qu'il y en a peu d'entre eux qui sachent plonger, &amp; que ceux-là même ne peuvent faire jusqu'au fond de cet air épais, où nous sommes, que des plongeons de très peu de durée.

In the 17th century, 'Genies' could refer to a broad category of supernatural beings, including spirits or demons from classical or other non-Christian traditions, which might carry more controversial theological weight (e.g., being perceived as pagan or demonic). Given the heightened religious tensions in England during James II's reign (1685-1688), with conflicts between Catholicism and Protestantism and efforts to reinforce theological orthodoxy, introducing potentially ambiguous or non-Christian spiritual entities could have been risky. Substituting 'Genies' with 'Faries' (fairies) domesticates the concept, grounding it in more familiar and generally less threatening English folklore. Fairies were often seen as mischievous rather than malevolent and existed in a cultural space less directly policed by theological doctrine. This change sanitizes the text by removing a term with potentially problematic ideological connotations and replacing it with a culturally safer equivalent, thereby minimizing potential offense or controversy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy.

This aligns with burgeoning Enlightenment ideas of a self-sufficient natural world, which could be seen as challenging traditional views of continuous divine creation and oversight—a sensitive notion in the religio-political climate of 1687 England under James II. The translation renders the full phrase as \"Nature hath as good a Fancy as Mrs. Harrison.\" By substituting \"bien de l'esprit\" with \"as good a Fancy as Mrs. Harrison,\" the translator effectively omits the potentially challenging philosophical concept of Nature's profound, autonomous intellect or spirit. \"Fancy,\" especially when trivialized by comparison to a contemporary figure like \"Mrs. Harrison\" (likely known for fashion or taste), dilutes the original's philosophical weight. This change can be interpreted as self-censorship, as it sanitizes the text by reducing Nature's agency to something more akin to aesthetic taste or whim, rather than a deeper intellect or spirit, thereby avoiding potential controversy related to deistic or pantheistic implications. The core concept conveyed by \"bien de l'esprit\" is thus intentionally excluded and replaced with a less provocative one."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, répliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mêmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

The omission tones down the 'French' character of the discourse, avoiding direct and potentially sensitive speculation on the physical appearance of female extraterrestrial beings.

The translator omits the crucial qualifying phrase 'tout ce qui paroît être' (anything that appears to be), which implies a degree of scientific skepticism or an observational stance. Instead, the translation rephrases and asserts that storms and tempests 'certainly are an effect of the wrath of Heaven.' This change removes Fontenelle's subtle critique of attributing natural events directly to divine agency, a characteristic of early Enlightenment thought. By shifting to an assertion of certainty, the translator aligns the text with a more orthodox religious viewpoint, possibly to avoid challenging religious sensibilities in late 17th-century England where theological orthodoxy was actively reinforced.","The French text describes a thought experiment: 'One would only need to remove this one [surface Rome], the rest would be a city in the manner of the Moon.' This specific hypothetical statement about radically altering Rome is entirely omitted by the translator. At the time of translation, Protestant England under a Catholic monarch (James II) experienced heightened religious and political tensions concerning Catholicism. Rome, as the symbolic center of the Catholic Church, was a sensitive topic. The idea of 'removing' surface Rome, even hypothetically, could have been interpreted as ideologically charged or disrespectful. The translator likely omitted this phrase to avoid potential controversy and to sanitize the text for an audience wary of Catholic influence, replacing the passage with more neutral contemporary English/European references."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle.

I find, says the Countess, with some concern, a Philosopher will never make a good Martyr, you can so quickly shift your Opinion, 'twas not many minutes since the Moon was a perfect Desart, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"2\">now the rest of the Planets are inhabited.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"3\">Why truly, Madam, said I,</span></span> there is a time for all things, and your true Philosopher believes any thing, or nothing, as the Maggot bites. Had you taken me in the sceptical Vein, I would have as soon granted a Nation in a Mustard Ball, as a living Creature in the Moon; but the tide is turn'd, and all the Planets are Peopled like an Anthill; yet, Raillery apart, this is not so very improbable as you think it; for do you believe we discover, (as I may say) all the Inhabitants of the Earth? there be as many kinds of invisible as visible Creatures; we see from the Elephant to the very Hand-worm, beyond which our Sight fails us, and yet counting from that minute Creature, there are an infinity of lesser Animals, which were they perceptible, would be as little in comparison with a Mite, as a Mite is of an Ox. How lately have our Virtuoso's found out the Pepper Worms, which in the least drop of Water appear like so many Dolphins, sporting in the Ocean; nay, they tell you that the sharpness of Vinegar consists in the fierceness of the little Animals that bite you by the Tongue; not to name the blue on Plums, and twenty Experiments of the like nature.</p>","explanations":["The source phrase, suggesting that merely transporting souls to another world is considered sufficient for their happiness ('& dans ces deux Planetes on croit avoir assez pourveu à la felicité des Ames, de les avoir transportées dans un autre Monde.'), is omitted. It would logically follow the Marquise's comment about blessed souls being sent from the Moon to Earth. The omission likely occurred because the phrase carries a cynical or skeptical tone regarding the nature of 'felicity for souls,' reducing it to mere relocation. This could have been perceived as flippant or materialistic concerning spiritual matters, potentially clashing with orthodox religious beliefs (Catholic and Protestant) in a period of heightened religious tension in England (1687). Removing it sanitizes the text from this subtle critique of conventional ideas about the afterlife.","The source phrase 'je reprens le Saint-Denis' (I take up Saint-Denis again), which would follow the mention of Venus, is omitted and replaced by 'which puts me again in mind of Greenwich.' Saint Denis was a French Catholic saint, and the story alluded to (his carrying his own head after martyrdom) is a miracle story. This reference was likely removed as it could be perceived as a 'Popish' or superstitious element by a predominantly Protestant English audience during the anti-Catholic sentiment of the late 1680s. Replacing it with Greenwich, a prominent English site associated with astronomy, serves to domesticate the text for the target audience and filters out a culturally specific and potentially controversial Catholic religious reference, thus sanitizing it.","The Marquise's direct statement predicting the philosopher's strong emotional reaction, 'si on osoit vous dire que toutes les Planetes ne sont pas aussi habitées que la Terre, je voy bien que vous vous mettriez en colere.' (if one dared to tell you that all the Planets are not as inhabited as Earth, I see well that you would get angry), is omitted. This observation would logically follow her remark about his current conviction ('now the rest of the Planets are inhabited.'). Instead, the translation substitutes a more general and detached comment: 'a Philosopher will never make a good Martyr, you can so quickly shift your Opinion'. Omitting the specific mention of anger tones down the philosopher's passionate, almost dogmatic, commitment to the controversial idea of planetary inhabitants. This sanitizes his portrayal, making his advocacy seem less aggressive or confrontational and therefore less challenging to established religious and philosophical views which held Earth and humanity as unique.","The philosopher's bold assertion, 'si vous m'eussiez contredit sur les Habitans des Planetes, non seulement je vous les aurois soutenus, mais je crois que je vous aurois dit comment ils êtoient tous faits.' (if you had contradicted me on the inhabitants of the planets, not only would I have defended them to you, but I believe I would have told you how they were all made), is omitted. This claim would have followed his initial acknowledgement 'Why truly, Madam, said I,'. The translation replaces this specific and audacious statement with a more general and somewhat flippant remark about a philosopher's changeable beliefs ('your true Philosopher believes any thing, or nothing, as the Maggot bites.'). The original claim to be able to describe how alien beings were 'made' could have been seen as hubristic, encroaching on divine prerogative (the creation of life), or dangerously speculative from a theological standpoint. Its omission sanitizes the text by removing a potentially blasphemous or overly radical assertion, thereby softening the philosopher's challenge to orthodox thought."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut.

This translates to '...you will surely find that the Earth is well populated, AND that Nature has so liberally spread animals there, that she did not bother that we should see only half of them.' The English translation renders the first part as 'you will find the Earth swarms with Inhabitants' but omits the conjoined clause 'et que la Nature y a si liberalement répandu les Animaux, qu'elle ne s'est pas mise en peine que l'on en vît seulement la moitié.' The omitted segment, particularly the latter part ('that she did not bother that we should see only half of them'), suggests Nature's indifference to human observation and its independent prolificness. This de-centers humanity's place in creation, challenging the anthropocentric view prevalent in 17th-century religious thought that creation was primarily for humanity's benefit or under God's direct, human-focused providence. Omitting this clause sanitizes the text of a potentially controversial philosophical idea that could be seen as diminishing divine concern for mankind or the unique status of humans, which was ideologically sensitive in the English religious and cultural context of the late 17th century, where theological orthodoxy was a significant concern."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">en quittant le ton serieux</span></span>? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"1\">Vous ay-je dubité assez de chimeres?</span></span> Vrayment, répondit-elle, il me semble que j'ay presentement moins de peine à attraper les differences de tous ces Mondes.

The translation omits this crucial description of his manner and instead has the philosopher ask if it's 'time... to be serious.' This inversion filters out Fontenelle's deliberate stylistic choice to frame the potentially controversial discussion in a lighter, more speculative, and less dogmatic manner. The omission and alteration of tone impose a gravity that might have been intended to make the ideas seem more sober or to avoid accusations of frivolity when dealing with profound topics that challenged existing worldviews. This sanitizes the original's rhetorical strategy for presenting sensitive content concerning new cosmology during a period of religious and intellectual tension.","The philosopher's original question, 'Vous ay-je dubité assez de chimeres?' (Have I provided you with enough chimeras/fantasies?), is omitted and effectively replaced by 'how will you dispose of all these Notions?'. The term 'chimeres' is an ideologically significant element, as it characterizes Fontenelle's speculative ideas about the plurality of worlds and Copernicanism. This term could serve as a rhetorical shield, acknowledging the fantastical nature of the ideas to make them more palatable, or be a playful way to engage the reader. By substituting the neutral 'Notions' for 'chimeres,' the translator filters out this complex framing. This censorship removes the ambiguity and potential provocativeness of 'chimeres,' thereby sanitizing the text and presenting the philosopher's discourse as less overtly fantastical, potentially to avoid criticism from religious authorities or conservative elements who might use the term 'chimeres' to dismiss the new scientific ideas.","The entire concluding sentence by the philosopher, 'Nous verrons demain s'ils vous auront bien servie, & s'ils vous auront appris comment sont faits les Habitans de quelque Planete.' (We will see tomorrow if they [the dreams] will have served you well, & if they will have taught you how the Inhabitants of some Planet are made.), is omitted from the translation. This sentence suggests that dreams could 'serve well' and 'teach' about the physical nature of extraterrestrial beings. This omission filters out a highly speculative assertion that blends scientific curiosity with a non-rational epistemology (knowledge from dreams). In the historical context of tension between emerging scientific thought and established theological orthodoxy, this passage was likely censored to avoid: 1. Giving credence to dreams as a valid source of knowledge about the cosmos or its inhabitants, which could be seen as unscientific or superstitious. 2. Speculating too explicitly on 'how the Inhabitants of some Planet are made,' which could directly challenge religious doctrines about divine creation, the uniqueness of humankind, and the established hierarchy of beings.

This omitted content is ideologically sensitive because it subtly introduces cultural relativism by suggesting non-European perspectives can validly critique European norms, and it challenges anthropocentrism by questioning the limits of human-centered imagination. In the politically and religiously charged atmosphere of 1680s England, such ideas questioning European cultural paradigms or humanity's central viewpoint could be seen as subversive or unsettling.

The source text states that the common people ('le menu Peuple') of Venus are composed of 'Celadons & de Silvandres' (archetypal refined lovers from French pastoral romances like Honoré d'Urfé's 'L'Astrée') and that their common conversations 'valent les plus belles de Clesie' (are equal in quality to the most beautiful conversations in Madeleine de Scudéry's romance 'Clélie'). In the target text, these specific French exemplars are entirely removed. Instead, the translator (Aphra Behn) substitutes a different set of references and a significantly altered comparison: the language of 'Clelia' (a nod to 'Clesie') and 'Parthenissa' (a character from an English romance) is presented as *inferior* to that of Venusian 'Grooms and Chamber Maids,' and common workers ('every Porter and Car-Man') are described as 'a perfect Sir Courtly' (a character type from English Restoration comedy, e.g. John Crowne's 'Sir Courtly Nice', 1685). This omission of the original French cultural signifiers and their replacement with anglicized or contemporary English literary/social types constitutes self-censorship. It filters out specific French cultural content, potentially to make the text more resonant with an English audience, to inject the translator's own satirical commentary on English society (evident in the surrounding additions), or to reduce the 'Frenchness' of the text in a period where Anglo-French relations could be complex. This results in the target text being ideologically 'sanitized' of these specific French cultural markers, replacing them with a framework more familiar or aligned with the translator's own cultural context and literary agenda."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, interrompit la Marquise, comment sont faits les Habitans de Vénus.

The translator omitted 'des Fêtes, des Danses,' (festivals, dances) which should have appeared in the target text after 'ever inventing' and before 'and Turnaments'. Instead, the translator substituted 'Masques' and added the phrase 'in honour of their Mistresses'. The 'Mores Grenadins' were a Muslim people from Granada, and their 'fêtes' (festivals) and 'danses' (dances) would refer to their specific Islamic or Andalusian cultural practices. In the religiously and politically tense context of 1687 England, where James II's pro-Catholic policies caused alarm among Protestants, any reference, even analogical, to non-Christian (specifically Islamic, in this case) cultural or religious practices could be considered sensitive. By omitting the general terms 'des Fêtes, des Danses,' and replacing them with 'Masques' (a form of courtly entertainment familiar and secular in England) and the chivalric 'in honour of their Mistresses', the translator filtered out the potentially 'foreign' or controversial cultural and religious connotations associated with the Moors. This sanitized the comparison, making it more aligned with European Christian cultural norms and less likely to cause offense or misinterpretation among the target English readership."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P058: Mais que sera-ce des Habitants de Mercure?

This sentence attributes human-like emotions (suffering under extreme heat and longing for relief/night) to the hypothetical inhabitants of Mercury. In the religious and philosophical context of late 17th-century England, marked by theological orthodoxy reacting to new scientific ideas, speculating on the sentience and inner emotional life of extraterrestrial beings was potentially controversial. Such attributions could blur the line of humanity's unique, divinely ordained status and invite complex theological questions regarding these other beings. The omission sanitizes this part of the text by removing an empathetic speculation that makes the Mercurians more than just 'mad' creatures, possibly to avoid provoking theological debate or discomfort among readers.","The French sentence 'Je suis bien faché de voir cette grande voûte ornée de mois d'Etoiles, & de ne voir celles qui me resteroient, que plus petites, & d'une couleur plus effacée. —.' (I am very sorry/vexed to see this great vault adorned with 'mois' [likely 'moins', fewer] Stars, & to see those that would remain to me, only smaller, & of a more faded color.) is omitted. This concluding reflection by the philosopher-narrator expresses personal sadness and aesthetic disappointment regarding a diminished view of the cosmos from Mercury. Fontenelle's work popularized a revolutionary Copernican cosmology that was unsettling to traditional, often religiously-underpinned, worldviews. In an England where religious authorities were reinforcing orthodoxy, expressing negative emotions like 'sorrow' or 'vexation' about the aesthetic consequences of this new cosmic perspective, especially from the work's main proponent, might have been considered undesirable. The translator may have censored this subjective and melancholic statement to present the scientific ideas in a more uniformly positive or neutral light, avoiding sentiments that could be interpreted as regret or dissatisfaction with the implications of the new, potentially impersonal universe, thereby reducing potential ideological friction."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P059: Je ne suis pas si touchée, dit la Marquise, de cette perte-là que sont les Habitans de Mercure, que de l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de chaleur.

This concept emphasizes Nature's ingenious autonomy, where Mercury itself is the source of the solution to the Sun's extreme heat. The English translation omits this specific articulation of Mercury's self-remedying capability, following 'We will fill the little Planet with Salt-petre,' with the different phrase 'and let the Sun shine as hot as he pleases.' This omission constitutes self-censorship because it filters out an ideologically sensitive concept: the active, self-sufficient design of Nature. In the context of 1687 England, with heightened religious sensitivities and efforts to reinforce theological orthodoxy, such a strong statement about a planet's inherent ability to find its own equilibrium could be seen as diminishing the role of continuous divine providence.

These phrases vividly describe the intense intellectual excitement and the fashionable status of new astronomical discoveries among the learned, providing context for why sunspots were quickly hypothesized to be new planets. The translator's omission of this description serves to downplay the fervor and the widespread, almost faddish, adoption of these new scientific ideas by the intellectual elite. In the socio-religious context of late 17th-century England—marked by religious tensions, fears of Catholic resurgence, and efforts by religious authorities to reinforce orthodoxy—such a depiction of the 'philosophical world' being completely captivated by potentially worldview-altering scientific 'fashions' could have been deemed ideologically sensitive. Removing these phrases subtly sanitizes the text by muting the portrayal of the era's intellectual upheaval and the powerful, absorbing draw of the burgeoning scientific revolution, thereby making the societal impact of these new ideas seem less pronounced and potentially less challenging to the established order."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

This phrasing suggests a potentially subservient or dependent relationship of philosophers/scientists with political rulers ('Princes'), possibly driven by necessity. This could have been a sensitive topic in 1687-1688 England, given the prevailing political tensions surrounding King James II's assertion of royal authority and the relationship between the monarchy and other societal groups. The translator deliberately omits this politically charged characterization. In the target text, the corresponding action of relinquishing celestial territory, described as 'if they part with the least Star', is not framed by this notion of pledging to Princes out of need. Instead, it is followed by the phrase ''tis on very good terms', which presents philosophers as autonomous actors making favorable commercial arrangements. This substitution sanitizes the potential political critique or observation about the power dynamics between intellectuals and rulers present in the source, replacing it with a less controversial and more commercially-oriented portrayal."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P063: J'avoüe que je m'étois trompé, répondis-je, je ne songeois qu'à la situation où est le Soleil,&amp; non à l'effet de sa lumiere; mais vous qui me redressez si à propos, vous voulez bien que je vous dise que vous vous êtes trompée aussi; les Habitans du Soleil ne le verroient seulement pas.

The translation \"why the Sun cannot be inhabited\" shifts the meaning to a statement of physical impossibility, thereby omitting the philosophically sensitive element of (lack of) design. This alteration neutralizes a potentially controversial point about purpose in creation, which was ideologically charged during the Scientific Revolution and in the religiously tense English context of 1688, by filtering out the implication of a comment on divine or natural 'making'.","The scientific term \"Satellites\" (referring to Jupiter's moons) is omitted from the translation and replaced by the culturally specific English term \"Yeomen of the Guard.\" This substitution filters out the neutral scientific terminology, domesticating the new astronomical concept by framing celestial mechanics within a familiar English courtly and monarchical hierarchy. This may have been a deliberate choice to make the new science more palatable or less alien, and to align it with established political structures during a period of political and religious sensitivity in England under James II, effectively sanitizing the 'foreignness' or starkness of the scientific term."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P064: Ah!

In the 17th-century English socio-cultural context, particularly with conservative High Church elements influential and traditional gender roles prevalent, such an unbridled portrayal of female intellectual passion for secular philosophy could be perceived as transgressing social norms of modesty and decorum for women. The omission of this declaration sanitizes the Marquise's portrayal, making her appear less challenging to established social hierarchies and gender expectations, and subtly downplaying the transformative or potentially 'dangerous' allure of philosophical inquiry if it leads to such an abandonment of societal norms.","The French phrase 'le seul hazard de' (the mere chance of/the sole hazard of) points directly to randomness or chance as a decisive factor in the formation of the cosmos and the destinies of celestial bodies. This concept of 'hazard' shaping the universe could directly conflict with the prevailing religious beliefs in a divinely ordered and purposeful creation, a particularly sensitive issue in late 17th-century England with its heightened religious tensions and calls for theological orthodoxy. Replacing this explicit notion of 'hazard' with 'the advantage of' (as in 'the advantage of Situation') effectively omits the ideologically charged term and substitutes it with a more neutral or even positive one that implies an inherent order or benefit within situations. This alteration serves to ideologically sanitize the text by downplaying a potentially materialistic or non-providential view of the universe, making it less challenging to the theological sensibilities of the English readership at the time."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes?

(I conceive, said the Marquise, that these gravities regulate the ranks [of planets] very well.), is omitted in the translation. The target text P055 begins with the translation of the second sentence of P067. This omitted sentence explicitly attributes the ordering of celestial bodies ('ranks') to natural forces ('pesanteurs' - gravities/weights). In the context of 1687 England, where religious authorities sought to uphold theological orthodoxy and might be wary of purely materialistic or deterministic explanations of the universe, this direct attribution of cosmic order to gravity alone could be seen as ideologically sensitive. Its omission might be a deliberate act of self-censorship to avoid downplaying divine agency in the cosmos or to soften Fontenelle's alignment with the emerging scientific, naturalistic worldview.","The source text (P068) states that eclipses on Jupiter are 'un sujet de divertissement, & non pas de frayeur, comme en celui-ci' (a subject of entertainment, and not of fear, as in this one [our world]). The translator omits the crucial contrasting phrase '& non pas de frayeur, comme en celui-ci'. This phrase highlights a rational, scientific view of natural phenomena in contrast to earthly superstition and fear, which often had religious connotations. In the religiously tense atmosphere of 1687 England, characterized by efforts to reinforce theological orthodoxy, this subtle Enlightenment critique of earthly fear (and by implication, superstition) was likely deemed ideologically sensitive. The translator replaces this contrast with a neutral, contemporary English cultural reference to the Duke of Buckingham's play 'The Rehearsal,' thereby sanitizing the text of its potentially challenging philosophical point.","The entirety of source paragraph P069 is omitted from the translation. This paragraph contains speculative discussion about the inhabitants of Jupiter's moons being like 'Colonies de Jupiter' (Colonies of Jupiter), potentially receiving 'leurs Loix & leurs Coûtumes' (their Laws and Customs) from Jupiter, rendering it 'hommage' (homage), and sending 'Députez dans Jupiter, pour luy prêter ferment de fidelité' (Deputies to Jupiter, to swear an oath of fealty to it). These terms ('Colonies', 'Laws', 'Customs', 'homage', 'Deputies', 'oath of fealty') are highly charged political concepts. In the volatile socio-political climate of England in 1687 under James II – marked by debates over royal authority, the King's Declaration of Indulgence bypassing Parliament, religious allegiances (Test Acts requiring oaths), and colonial activities – such language, even in a metaphorical astronomical context, could be seen as dangerously allusive to contemporary earthly politics, governance, and loyalty. The complete omission of this paragraph suggests a deliberate act of self-censorship to avoid any controversial interpretations or unwelcome parallels with English political issues."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P070: Et vous ne manquerez pas, dit la Marquise, à faire habiter ces quatre Lunes, quoy que ce ne foient que de petites Planetes subalternes, destinées seulement à en éclairer une autre pendant ces nuits?

This suggests that if one superstition (fear of eclipses) is removed, it must necessarily be replaced by another 'sottise'. This skeptical view on the persistence of irrationality, implying humanity is prone to swapping one folly for another, could be seen as undermining religious claims to singular truth or the idea of enlightenment leading away from all superstition, especially in the religiously charged context of late 17th-century England. The translator omits this pointed question and instead has the Marquise state, 'Every one has their due folly...', thereby sanitizing the text from this potentially controversial philosophical point about the cyclical nature of human 'sottise'.","The philosopher's original response to the Marquise's reflection on fear and folly is 'Il le faut de necessité absolue, répondis-je' (It is an absolute necessity, I replied / It must be so, by absolute necessity, I replied). The translator renders this as 'It is very true, said I,'. The omission of 'de necessité absolue' (by absolute necessity) significantly weakens the philosopher's deterministic and potentially cynical assertion. This strong affirmation that folly is an 'absolute necessity' could be interpreted as a critique of all firmly held beliefs not based on reason, potentially including religious dogmas, which would be sensitive in a period concerned with theological orthodoxy. The omission sanitizes the text by removing the philosopher's emphatic endorsement of this skeptical view on the inevitability of superstition."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit- elle, après que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The translator replaces this complex passage with a simpler one about \"Ticho Brahe\" and his \"Superstition,\" avoiding the source's broader, potentially subversive philosophical implications regarding intellectual dissent and the nature of truth, likely to prevent controversy in the tense socio-religious climate of 1687 England.","The source text states that \"only very reasonable people are willing to doubt\" (\"il n'y a que les Gens tres raisonnables qui en veulent bien douter.\") new discoveries challenging established views. The translation significantly softens this to \"yet some few may be a little curious\". The original praises \"doubt\" as characteristic of \"very reasonable people,\" an Enlightenment virtue. In 1687 England, with religious authorities reinforcing orthodoxy, valorizing \"doubt\" could be seen as undermining faith. Replacing \"doubt\" with passive \"curiosity\" and \"very reasonable people\" with \"some few\" mitigates this potentially controversial stance, sanitizing the text by downplaying skepticism's intellectual importance.","The source text's specific mention of \"le Journal des Savants de ce Pays-là en parle;\" (the Journal of Scholars of that country speaks of it;), a clear reference to the prominent French academic journal humorously posited on Jupiter, is replaced by the generic phrase \"if they publish their discovery,\". This omission filters out a specific cultural reference to an institution central to the new scientific communication of the era. While possibly done for simplification, it also lessens Fontenelle's satirical parallel with real-world academic mechanisms for disseminating (and resisting) new ideas, thereby slightly diluting the critique of how knowledge is received.","The source states \"Les Lurieux vont la voir au bout d'une Lunette\" (The Inquisitive/Curious ones go to see it through a Telescope), suggesting a select group seeks to observe the newly discovered Earth. The translation changes this to \"every body runs to see it at the end of the Telescope\". This alteration replaces Fontenelle's more differentiated, possibly critical or elitist, view of public engagement with scientific discovery with a more universally enthusiastic one. This shift may be an ideological sanitization, presenting the popular reception of new knowledge as more democratic and less selective than in the original, which subtly commented on varying levels of public intellectual curiosity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P074: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">Si ce n'êtoit, dit la Marquise, qu'il n'est point trop agreable de savoir qu'on ne nous peut découvrir de dedans Jupiter qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche,</span></span> je me représenterois avec plaisir ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, comme les nôtres le sont vers luy, &amp; cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considèrent &amp; demandent l'une de l'autre, Quel monde est-ce là?

This idea touches upon humanity's place in the cosmos, potentially challenging the anthropocentric worldview supported by religious doctrines of the time. The target text omits this initial reflection and starts the Marquise's speech with her subsequent, more positive thought ('It must be pleasant...'), thereby sanitizing the text by removing a potentially unsettling expression of cosmological humility.","The French phrase 'Dieu sait comme' (God knows how), which acts as an intensifier for the mockery an Earth-believing Jovian philosopher would face ('Dieu sait comme tout Jupiter se moque de luy' - God knows how all Jupiter mocks him), is entirely omitted. The English translation renders this as 'he might be sufficiently ridicul'd,'. The omission removes a direct, albeit idiomatic, reference to God in a speculative context. In the religiously charged atmosphere of late 17th-century England, the translator may have deliberately avoided such an expression to prevent potential controversy or to maintain a more secular tone in a scientific work, thus ideologically sanitizing the text of a casual religious exclamation.","The source text's phrase 'en sommes-nous punis par' (we are punished for it by), referring to the consequences of discovering more planets ('aussi en sommes-nous punis par les grands travaux que l'Astronomie demande presentement' - also we are punished for it by the great labors that Astronomy presently demands), is replaced in the target text with 'and so render'd the Science of Astronomy much more difficult'. This change removes the concept of 'punishment' for seeking knowledge, which could have been ideologically sensitive. In an era where scientific advancement sometimes clashed with theological views on divine limits to human understanding, the idea of being 'punished' for astronomical discoveries might have been seen as too provocative. The alteration neutralizes this implication, framing the outcome as a practical difficulty rather than a moral or quasi-divine retribution, thereby sanitizing the text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P077: Je voy, reprit-elle, par ce nombre de seize Planetes qu'il faut que Saturne ait cinq Lunes.

This omission significantly tones down the emphasis on the extraordinary nature of Saturn's features as described by Fontenelle. In the religiously sensitive context of late 17th-century England, reducing the rhetorical force that highlights the autonomous wonders of 'Nature' could be a form of self-censorship.

The translator omits the crucial phrase 'sans aucun art' and instead renders the clause as 'like so many Illuminations at a Birth day night?'. The omission of 'sans aucun art' removes Fontenelle's emphasis on these illuminations being purely natural phenomena, created without any external skill, design, or artifice. This emphasis on nature's inherent ability to produce wonders 'without art' could be ideologically sensitive in the late 17th century, as it aligns with emerging Enlightenment ideas about a self-sufficient natural world, potentially challenging religious doctrines emphasizing divine creation and continuous intervention (argument from design). The translator's substitution with 'Illuminations at a Birth day night' — a human-made, artificial, and festive spectacle — domesticates Fontenelle's more radical naturalistic image and makes the passage less philosophically challenging to prevailing theological views. This deliberate filtering of an element that underscores nature's autonomy in creating beauty can be considered an instance of self-censorship aimed at ideological sanitization."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oiseaux.

This substitution changes the philosopher's reason for setting aside intractable problems from intellectual 'despair' (a potentially unsettling admission of the limits of reason during the early Enlightenment) to mere pragmatism (completing the system). This sanitizes the philosophical weight of encountering unsolvable scientific issues, making the scientific endeavor appear less fraught and more straightforwardly manageable, which might have been preferred in a period of religious and intellectual tension where the authority of reason was being established against older orthodoxies.","The translator omitted the phrase 'en riant' (laughing), which described the Marquise's manner as she posed her question.

By shortening the reference to simply 'Cato,' the translator might have aimed to reduce the explicitness of this political allusion, thereby softening its potential impact and 'sanitizing' a potentially controversial classical reference.

This alteration likely constitutes self-censorship due to the religious climate in late 17th-century England. With heightened tensions between Catholics and Protestants, particularly during James II's reign, a direct translation of a religious exclamation might have been deemed inappropriate, too familiar, or potentially offensive. The substitution sanitizes the religious content, making it more neutral for the English audience.","The philosopher's original question to the Marquise, \"que si on vous proposoit de ces plaisirs vifs, vous vous souviendriez des Tourbillons & de moy, & que vous vous borneriez à nous?\" (that if you were offered these keen pleasures, you would remember the Whirlwinds & me, & that you would limit yourself to us?), is entirely omitted. It is replaced by the more formal and didactic statement: \"that Philosophy was the pleasure you propose, that when you think of Vortex's, you would not forget an humble Servant of your Ladyships.\" This self-censorship removes the playful, somewhat flirtatious, and personal nature of the philosopher's words. The original French implies a galant interaction characteristic of salon culture, which might have been considered too forward or improper for the English public, especially in a work intended for a broad audience including women. The translation opts for a more decorous and less suggestive tone, reflecting a cultural sanitization.","The Marquise's original direct request, \"mais faites que la Philosophie me fournisse toûjours des plaisirs nouveaux.\" (but ensure that Philosophy always provides me with new pleasures.), is omitted. It is replaced by a more conditional and moralizing statement: \"while it diverts innocently, but no longer.\" This change censors the Marquise's explicit and assertive desire for continuous intellectual 'new pleasures'. The translator instead inserts a concern for 'innocent' diversion, aligning her character with potentially more conservative English social expectations regarding women's intellectual pursuits and expressions of desire. This sanitization makes the Marquise seem more modest and less driven by personal (potentially hedonistic) intellectual curiosity, fitting her into a more conventional role."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: CINQUIEME SOIR. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">Que les étoiles fixes sont autant de Soleils, dont chacun éclaire un monde.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P066: The Fifth Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P066: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">The Fifth Evening.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French source text provides a full title for the fifth evening: 'CINQUIEME SOIR. Que les étoiles fixes sont autant de Soleils, dont chacun éclaire un monde.' (The Fifth Evening. That the fixed stars are as many Suns, each of which illuminates a world.). The English translation omits the descriptive second part of this title, 'Que les étoiles fixes sont autant de Soleils, dont chacun éclaire un monde.'. This omitted phrase explicitly states the radical idea of a plurality of worlds, where each star is a sun with its own world. This concept directly challenged the prevailing religious and philosophical views of the late 17th century, particularly the uniqueness of Earth and humanity in God's creation, and implicitly diminished the role of a singular, Earth-focused Creator. Given the religious tensions in England during the reign of James II (1685-1689), where religious authorities sought to reinforce orthodoxy against new scientific ideas, the omission of this subtitle likely represents self-censorship. By removing this explicit declaration, the translator or publisher would have ideologically sanitized the heading, making the chapter's controversial core thesis less immediately prominent and potentially avoiding religious or political censure in a volatile environment."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P086:.

This original phrasing reflects a confident, human-centric rationalism, where the vastness of cosmic scales is assessed with a degree of casual scientific detachment, characteristic of Fontenelle's popularizing style. The translator effectively replaces this nuanced statement with 'it is almost beyond Arithmetick,' a phrase that shifts the tone towards the incomprehensible magnitude and awe-inspiring nature of these distances. This change likely constitutes self-censorship, as it filters out Fontenelle's potentially challenging secular rationalism. By substituting it with a sentiment emphasizing mystery and the limits of human comprehension, the translation aligns more closely with prevailing religious sensibilities in late 17th-century England, which viewed the cosmos as a testament to divine grandeur rather than a subject for casual human dismissal of its smaller components in comparison."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P087: Ne me trompay-je point, s'écria la Marquise, ou si je vois où vous me voulez mener?

The English translation replaces this with 'or what will become of me,' shifting the focus from existential nullification to future uncertainty. This omission of 'je ne suis plus rien' likely serves to soften the stark philosophical implications of the new cosmology, which could be seen as challenging religious views on humanity's special status in creation, thereby making the text less ideologically jarring for a 17th-century English audience.","The phrase '& que je suis dans un plus grand air' (and that I am in a greater air/a larger atmosphere), which follows the philosopher's statement about breathing with more liberty, is omitted. This phrase metaphorically emphasizes the expansive intellectual and personal freedom derived from the new understanding of the universe. Its omission lessens the portrayal of the transformative, liberating impact of scientific discovery, a key Enlightenment theme that might have been considered subtly challenging to established intellectual or religious authorities.","The clause 'qui est tout-à-fait digne d'elle' (which is entirely worthy of her [Nature]), referring to Nature's profusion in creating the universe, is omitted. This phrase personifies Nature and attributes to it a high degree of inherent generative power and worthiness. In the context of 17th-century England, where religious orthodoxy was being reinforced, such an elevation of Nature could be interpreted as deistic or pantheistic, diminishing the role of a divine Creator. The omission filters out this potentially controversial ideological coloring.","The French adjective 'infinis' (infinite), used to describe the 'Tourbillons' (Vortices/worlds), is replaced in the English translation by 'innumerable'. The concept of an *infinite* universe or an infinite number of worlds was a highly contentious theological and philosophical idea, challenging traditional cosmology and the uniqueness of Earth and humanity. 'Innumerable' (too many to count) is a less radical claim than 'infinite' (boundless, without end). This substitution represents self-censorship by avoiding the explicit assertion of an infinite plurality of worlds, thereby mitigating a direct challenge to prevailing religious doctrines about creation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P089: Vous m'offrez, dit-elle, une espece de Perspective si longue, que la veuë n'en peut attraper le bout.

This paragraph contains the Marquise directly questioning the truth and necessity of the philosopher's cosmological system ('votre Systême est-il bien vray?', 'Cela est-il d'une necessité bien absoluë?'). The philosopher responds by comparing mathematical and scientific reasoning to the seductive advances of a lover ('les raisonnemens de Mathematique sont faits comme l'Amour'), a 'folie de galanterie'. This omission constitutes self-censorship because: \n1. Religious/Ideological Sensitivity: In the late 17th-century English context, with ongoing religious tensions and the controversial nature of Copernicanism and the plurality of worlds, explicitly voicing skepticism about the 'truth' of these new scientific ideas, or exposing their reliance on analogy ('petite convenance bien legere'), might have been deemed too unsettling or problematic for religious orthodoxy.\n2. Cultural/Moral Decorum: The philosopher's extended metaphor comparing scientific persuasion to a lover's seduction could have been perceived as too frivolous, indecorous, or even morally suspect for the English audience, especially when discussing profound scientific and philosophical matters. This 'French' gallantry might have been filtered out to maintain a more sober and serious tone appropriate for scientific popularization in England.\n3. Sanitization of Speculation: Omitting this exchange removes a significant moment where the speculative nature and epistemological basis of the new science are questioned and playfully defended. This sanitizes the text, making the preceding arguments about the plurality of worlds appear less contentious or more straightforwardly accepted than Fontenelle might have intended in this reflective passage. The translator might have sought to avoid highlighting the less 'certain' aspects of the emerging scientific worldview."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P091: Cela est hors de doute, répondis-je.

The English translation renders this as 'its Light makes a much greater impression on our Eyes'. The word 'infiniment' (infinitely) is omitted, and the concept is toned down to 'much'. In the late 17th-century English context, with its religious and political sensitivities, explicitly claiming an 'infinite' physical force for the sun, distinct from divine infinity, could be perceived as ideologically charged or challenging to theological orthodoxy. The translator's decision to soften 'infinitely' to 'much' likely represents a deliberate act of self-censorship to make Fontenelle's scientific assertion less absolute and potentially less controversial, thereby sanitizing the text for the contemporary audience wary of ideas that might seem to undermine established religious or philosophical views."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est de deviner. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">Que say-je?</span></span> Un Tourbillon a plus de Planetes qui tournent autour de son Soleil, un autre en a moins.

(What do I know?), which directly follows the philosopher's acknowledgement of the 'difficulty to guess' ('la difficulté est de deviner'), is omitted in the translation. This phrase signals epistemic humility and flags the subsequent list of cosmic possibilities as speculative. Its removal, after the source's 'deviner' (to guess) was already rendered as the more epistemically broad 'to know wherein they differ,' lessens the explicit expression of personal uncertainty by the philosopher. In an era where new scientific claims about the cosmos could challenge established orthodoxies (religious, philosophical), this omission might have been a deliberate choice to present the speculations with a subtly more assertive or less personally hedged tone. This could serve to align the discourse with a different rhetorical strategy for presenting scientific ideas in the English context of the late 17th century, or to avoid perceptions of excessive skepticism that might undermine the authority of the new philosophy, thus making the text ideologically 'safer' or more aligned with target culture norms for such discourse.","The rhetorical question 'que voudriez-vous?' (What would you expect/desire?), which appears in the source text immediately after 'Enfin,' (Finally/In short,), is omitted. The source's 'Enfin,' is rendered as 'But,' in the target text, and 'que voudriez-vous?' which follows it, is dropped before the translation of 'En voila bien assez...' ('I think I have said enough...'). This omission removes a characteristic French conversational flourish that expresses a degree of polite resignation or implies the limits of the discourse ('what more can be said/expected from someone like me?'). Its removal makes the philosopher's concluding remarks more direct and less nuanced in their performed modesty. This filters out a cultural element of Fontenelle's style, which was integral to his project of making science accessible and engaging (an ideological aspect of his work). By simplifying this rhetorical posture, the translation subtly shifts the tone away from the original's salon-like charm, potentially to align with a more formal or less overtly 'popular' ideological presentation of scientific inquiry prevalent in the English context of the time."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P093: Ce n'en est guere, répondit-elle, pour la quantité des Mondes.

This omission of 'n'est-il pas vray?' and the subsequent reformulation significantly weakens the Marquise's claim, turning it from an accepted premise (for her) into a hypothesis. This alteration can be interpreted as a deliberate act of self-censorship. Given that the translation appeared shortly after Newton's 'Principia Mathematica' (1687), which challenged Cartesian physics (including vortex theory), the translator might have chosen to soften assertions related to Cartesianism to avoid presenting them as undisputed fact in an English scientific context increasingly influenced by Newtonian ideas. This makes the text less dogmatic regarding a specific detail of a contested scientific theory."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P097: Il y a beaucoup d'esprit, répondis-je, à avoir cette difficulté-là, &amp; même à ne la pouvoir résoudre; car elle est tres-bonne en soy, &amp; de la maniere dont <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">vous</span></span> la concevez, elle est sans réponse, &amp; c'est avoir bien peu d'esprit que de trouver des réponses à ce qui n'en a point.

The English translation 'Nature... presently fills up this void space' omits the direct address 'vous'. This omission depersonalizes Nature's action, making the text more formal and less conversational. Given Fontenelle's aim to popularize science, especially for a female audience, by using an accessible and engaging style, removing this direct address could be a subtle form of self-censorship. It might have been done to make the work appear more 'serious' or aligned with the more formal scientific discourse prevalent in England, thereby filtering out a key aspect of Fontenelle's popularizing (and implicitly, democratizing) approach to science, which was a cultural element of the original's presentation.","The French phrase 'fort contents d'eux-mêmes' means the small worlds are 'very content with themselves,' indicating an intrinsic, self-derived satisfaction. The core of this self-referential contentment lies in 'd'eux-mêmes' (with/of themselves). The English translation renders this as 'well satisfy'd with their being where they are'. The direct equivalent of 'd'eux-mêmes', such as 'with themselves', is omitted after 'well satisfy'd' and is instead replaced by 'with their being where they are'. This exclusion of 'd'eux-mêmes' filters out the specific concept of self-contentment. In the context of Enlightenment thought and a mechanistic universe, attributing autonomous, self-derived contentment to parts of the universe could be ideologically sensitive, potentially challenging views of a divinely ordained hierarchy or purpose. The translator's alteration makes the contentment dependent on external circumstances rather than internal self-sufficiency, thereby sanitizing this potentially radical philosophical implication."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">toutes</span></span> ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

This omission reduces the scope of the Marquise's expressed enthusiasm for the new philosophical and scientific concepts from an embrace of *all* the ideas under discussion to just \"these\" (which can imply a more limited or selective set of) fancies. In the socio-political and cultural context of late 17th-century England, with its religious tensions and concerns about challenges to orthodoxy, downplaying a character's wholesale acceptance of potentially radical Enlightenment ideas could be a deliberate act of self-censorship.

In the source text, her laughter at the philosopher's metaphor of comets as 'Deputez' (Ambassadors) contributes to the literary charm and portrays her as a relatable individual engaging with scientific ideas. The omission of her laughter makes the Marquise appear more consistently serious. During the late 17th century, women pursuing intellectual endeavors, particularly in science, often faced societal prejudice that could dismiss them as frivolous. The translator might have deliberately removed the Marquise's laughter to preempt any interpretation of her character as flighty or not taking the scientific discussion seriously, thereby aiming to present her as a more uniformly grave and legitimate female intellectual figure. This modification can be seen as an attempt to sanitize her portrayal to align with more rigid expectations of intellectual engagement, especially for a woman in a scientific text.","The translator omitted the phrase 'nous reprochent sans cesse inutilité' (ceaselessly reproach us for the uselessness), which conveys a strong and persistent accusation by the 'Enemies' (opponents of the new science) concerning the 'grand espace vide' (large empty space) in the Cartesian vortex model. This accusatory phrase is replaced in the target text with the much milder 'often ask us, to what purpose [this void space serves]'. This substitution significantly tones down the intensity and nature of the criticism, omits the explicit charge of 'uselessness' ('inutilité'), and changes an assertive 'reproach' into a mere 'question'. In the socio-religious context of late 17th-century England, where scientific advancements like Fontenelle's popularization of Copernicanism and Cartesianism were often viewed with suspicion by conservative religious authorities, portraying the conflict as a direct and harsh 'reproach of uselessness' could have been ideologically sensitive. Such a charge could imply imperfections in a divinely created cosmos or a flawed scientific understanding challenging established doctrines. The translator's alteration sanitizes this intellectual dispute, presenting a less confrontational interaction and potentially making the new scientific ideas seem less embattled or offensive to prevailing orthodoxies."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P101: J'entends, dit-elle..

This implies that the planets are actively involved or associated with the act of 'receiving' comets, suggesting a collective agency or role for the planets within the solar system. The English translation alters this significantly. It takes the concept of \"our Planets\" but rephrases and repositions it as \"among our own Planets,\" making it part of the description of where comets are *not* allowed to enter (\"we do not suffer them to come into the heart of our Vortex, among our own Planets\"). Consequently, the original idea that \"we receive them [comets] *with* our Planets\" is omitted from the subsequent clause in the target text (\"but we receive them as the Grand Signior...\"). This omission can be interpreted as self-censorship because attributing active agency or a co-participant role to planets in cosmic events, a form of personification common in Fontenelle's work, might have been considered ideologically sensitive. In the late 17th century, during a period of heightened religious and political tension in England, such phrasing could subtly challenge the prevailing theological view of a divinely created and ordered universe where celestial bodies were often seen as passive objects rather than active agents. The translator may have deliberately chosen to remove this nuance to avoid any interpretation that might be seen as unorthodox or diminishing the unique agency of a divine creator, thereby sanitizing the text for an audience potentially wary of radical philosophical implications in popular science."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P102: A en juger par toutes ces choses là, répliqua-t-elle,. nous sommes bien fiers.

We that never go out of our own, lead but a dull Life; if the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the wit to foresee the time when they are to come into our world, they that had already made the Voyage, would tell their Neighbours beforehand what they should see, they would tell them, that they would discover a Planet with a great Ring about it, meaning our Saturn, they would also say, you shall see another Planet which hath four little ones to wait on it; and perhaps some of them, resolv'd to observe the very Moment of their entring into our World, would presently cry out A New Sun, a New Sun, as Sailors use to cry Land, Land.</p>","explanations":["The French phrase \"on la devinera quand on pourra\" (meaning 'one will figure it out/divine it when one can') is omitted. It appears after 'une espèce d'illumination' in the source. The translator replaced this expression of collective, future conjecture with the philosopher's more assertive and individual claim, \"and when I am able I will tell you how 'tis done.\" The original term \"devinera\" (from \"deviner\" - to guess, to divine) could have been problematic in the religiously sensitive English context of 1688, as \"divining\" could connote occult practices or undermine the perceived certainty of science. Omitting this phrase and its speculative tone sanitizes the presentation of scientific inquiry, making it appear more authoritative and avoiding language that might be misconstrued as aligning science with religiously dubious methods.","The French dative pronoun \"nous\" (to us) in the phrase \"elle nous apporte tous ses Habitans en bonne santé\" (it brings to us all its inhabitants in good health) is omitted in the translation \"it brings all its Inhabitants with it in very good health;\". The omission of \"nous\" removes the direct indication that the comet's inhabitants are brought specifically *to us* (i.e., to Earth's sphere of interaction). In an era when the concept of plural worlds and extraterrestrial life was revolutionary and potentially clashed with theological views on Earth's unique status, suggesting a direct arrival of such beings \"to us\" could be particularly unsettling. The translator's choice to omit \"nous\" and rephrase slightly lessens the immediacy and potential ideological shock of this statement for the English audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P104: Il ne faut donc plus songer, luy dis-je, à vous donner de la pitié pour les Habitans d'une Comète, mais j'espère du moins que vous plaindrez ceux qui vivent dans un Tourbillon dont le Soleil vient à s'éteindre, &amp; qui demeurent dans une nuit éternelle. Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles Fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumière; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; car que faire sans Soleil? Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? Je vous diray, si vous voulez, répondis je, ce que disent de fort habiles Gens, que les Etoiles Fixes qui ont disparu ne sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est-à-dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mêmes, tantôt ils nous présentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantôt la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion-là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoître, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mêmes? Vous êtes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur. Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles Fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantôt plus grandes tantôt plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus légers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur. Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement, des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoîtroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoître de longtemps. Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text SC\" data-index=\"0\">Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer?</span></span> On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, il faut que l'espce se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, répliquai-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au-delà, il faudroit être plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent être ou n'être pas si on veut, ou être tels que l'on veut, il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P083: You have no reason then, said I, to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, yet I suppose you will think their Condition lamentable, who inhabit a Vortex whose Sun comes in time to be quite extinguished, and consequently live in Eternal Night. How? cry'd the Countess, can Suns be put out? Yes, without doubt said I, for People some thousand years ago saw fix'd Stars in the Sky, which are now no more to be seen; these were Suns which have lost their Light, and certainly there must be strange Desolation in their Vortex's, and a general Mortality over all the Planets, for what can People do without a Sun? This is a dismal Fancy, said the Countess, I would not if I could help it, let it come into my head. I will tell you if you please, I reply'd, what in this particular is the Opinion of Learned Astronomers. They think that the fix'd Stars which have disappear'd, are not quite extinguish'd, but that they are half Suns, that is, they have one half Dark, and the other half Light, and turning round upon their own Axis or Centre, they sometimes shew us their Light side, and afterwards turning to us their Dark side, we see them no more. To oblige you Madam, I will be of this Opinion, because it is not so harsh as the other, but I cannot make it good, but in relation to some certain Stars, because as some have lately observed, those Stars have their Regulated times of appearing, and disappearing, otherwise there could be no such thing as half Suns. But what shall we say of Stars, which totally disappear, and never shew themselves again after they have finish'd their Course of turning round upon their own Axis? you are too just Madam to oblige me to believe that such Stars are half Suns. However I will try once more what I can do in favour of your Opinion; the Suns are not extinct, they are only sunk so low into the immense depth of Heaven, that we cannot possibly see them, in this Case the Vortex follows his Sun and all's well again. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fix'd Stars have not this motion, by which they remove themselves so far from us, because at other times they might return again nearer to us, and we should see them sometimes greater, and sometimes less, which never happens. But we will suppose that none but the Little, Light, and most Active Vortex's which slip between the others make certain voyages, after which they return again, while the main body of Vortex's remain unmov'd. 'Tis likewise very strange that some fix'd Stars shew themselves to us, spending a great deal of time in appearing, and disappearing, and at last, totally and entirely disappear. Half Suns would appear again at their set and regulated time. Now Madam, boldly declare your Opinion; Must not these Stars of necessity be Suns which are so much darkned as not to be visible to us, yet afterwards shine again, and at last are wholly extinct? How can a Sun said the Countess, be darkned, and quite extinguish'd, when it is in its own Nature a Fountain of Light? It may be done Madam, said I, with all the ease in the world, if Desc�rtes Opinion be true, that our Sun hath Spots; now whether these Spots be Scum or thick Mists, or what you please, they may thicken and unite, till at last they cover the Sun with a Crust, which daily grows thicker, and then Farewell Sun. We have hitherto scap'd pretty well; but 'tis said, that the Sun for some whole years together hath look'd very pale; for Example, the year after Caesar's death; it was this Crust that then began to grow, but the force of the Sun broke and dissipated it; had it continued, we had been all lost People. You make me tremble, reply'd the Countess; and now I know the fatal consequences of the Sun's paleness, I believe, instead of going every morning to my Glass, to see how I look, I shall cast my Eyes up to Heaven, to see whether or no the Sun looks pale. Oh, Madam, said I, there is a great deal of time required to ruine a World. Grant it, said she, yet 'tis but time that is required. I confess it, said I; all this immense mass of Matter that composes the Universe, is in perpetual motion, no part of it excepted; and since every part is moved, you may be sure that changes must happen sooner or later; but still in times proportioned to the Effect. The Ancients were pleasant Gentlemen, to imagine that the celestial Bodies were in their own nature unchangeable, because they observed no change in them; but they did not live long enough to confirm their opinion by their own experience; they were Boys in comparison of us. Give me leave, Madam, to explain my self by an Allegory: If Roses, which last but a day, could write Histories, and leave Memoirs one to another; and if the first Rose should draw an exact Picture of their Gardiner, and after fifteen thousand Rose-Ages, it should be left to other Roses, and so left still to those that should succeed, without any change in it; should the Roses hereupon say, we have every day seen the same Gardiner, and in the memory of Roses, none ever saw any Gardiner but this; he is still the same he was, and therefore certainly he will never die, as we do; for there is no change at all in him. Would not these Roses, Madam, talk very foolishly? and yet there would be more reason in their discourse, than there was in what the Ancients said concerning celestial Bodies; and tho' even to this very day there should appear no visible change in the Heavens, and the matter of which they are made, should have all the signs of an eternal duration without any change; yet I would not believe 'em unchangeable, till I had the experience of many more Ages. Ought we, who last but a moment, make our continuance the measure of any other things duration; 'tis not so easie a matter to be eternal. To have lasted many Ages of Men, one after another, is no sign of Immortality. Truly, says the Countess, I find the Worlds are far from being able to pretend to it; I will not do 'em so much honour, as to ompare 'em to the Gardiner that lived so much longer than the Roses: I begin to think 'em like the Roses themselves, which blow one day, and die the next: For now I understand, that if old Stars disappear, new ones will come in their room, because every species must preserve it self. No species, Madam, said I, can totally perish; some perhaps will tell you, that such new Stars are Suns, which return to our sight again, after they have been a long time hid from us, in the profundity of Heaven: Others may tell you, they are Suns cleared from that thick crust, which once covered them: If I should think all this possible, yet I likewise believe that the Universe may be framed in such a manner, that from time to time it may produce new Suns; why may not that matter which is proper to make a Sun, be dispers'd here and there, and gather it self again at long run, into one certain place, and lay the foundation of a new World? I am very much inclin'd to believe such new productions, because they suit with that glorious and admirable Idea which I have of the works of Nature. Can we think that wise Nature knows no more than the secret of making Herbs and Plants live and die by a continual revolution? I am verily perswaded, and are not you so too, Madam? that Nature, without much cost or pains can put the same secret in practice, upon the Worlds. I now find, says the Countess, the Worlds, the Heaven, and celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am come to my self again. To come the better again to our selves, I reply'd, let us say no more of these Matters. We are arrived at the very roof and top of all the Heavens; and to tell you whether there be any Stars beyond it, you must have an abler Man than I am; you may place Worlds there, or no Worlds, as you please: 'Tis the Philosopher's Empire to describe those vast invisible Countries, which are, and are not, or are such as he pleases to make 'em: It is enough for me, to have carried your mind as far as you can see with your Eyes.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P083: You have no reason then, said I, to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, yet I suppose you will think their Condition lamentable, who inhabit a Vortex whose Sun comes in time to be quite extinguished, and consequently live in Eternal Night.

(Would it mean that what has lasted a hundred thousand times longer than us, must always last?). This sentence logically follows the English phrase 'measure of any other things duration;' and precedes the translated statement ''tis not so easie a matter to be eternal.' The omitted sentence provides a specific, quantifiable example (lasting 'a hundred thousand times longer than us') to challenge the assumption that very long-lasting phenomena are necessarily eternal. Its removal softens this particular philosophical critique. In the religious and intellectual context of late 17th-century England, where theological orthodoxy regarding concepts like God's eternity was strong, this specific rationalist deconstruction of how 'eternity' might be inferred could have been considered ideologically sensitive. Omitting this step makes Fontenelle's argument slightly less direct and concrete in its challenge to unexamined notions of permanence and eternity, thereby sanitizing this aspect of his reasoning."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers!

This phrase in the source text qualifies the Marquise's freedom to disbelieve the philosopher, emphasizing that she can reject his teachings entirely based on mere caprice or whim. The omission of this specific qualifier softens the radical intellectual autonomy granted to the Marquise and tones down the potential for a whimsical, rather than reasoned, dismissal of profound (and potentially controversial) scientific ideas. In the highly charged religious and political climate of late 17th-century England, where new scientific concepts were challenging established orthodoxy, suggesting that these new truths could be dismissed so lightly (merely 'on a whim') might have been perceived as ideologically problematic—potentially too flippant, subversive, or undermining to the seriousness of intellectual inquiry and the authority of knowledge itself. The translator likely omitted this phrase to present the philosopher's offer of intellectual freedom in a more measured and less provocative light, thereby sanitizing the text by removing a potentially challenging assertion of individual caprice over matters of truth."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: FIN</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P085: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P085: FINIS.</p>","explanations":[]}],"counts":{"manual":2,"ai":124}}
