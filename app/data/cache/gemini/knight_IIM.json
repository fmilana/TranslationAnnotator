Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune estoit levée il y avoit Page 8] peut-estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moyndre Etoile; elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">resverie aussi douce</span></span> que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">me feroit encore mieux resver</span></span> que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens</span></span>, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">C'est apparemment</span></span>, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">l'on en resve mieux</span></span>, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">favorise la resverie</span></span>, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">tous ces Mondes.</span></span> Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">mon imagination s'est échapée.</span></span> Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">Helas, repliquay-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer;</span></span> je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"11\">C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"12\">Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.</span></span> Et bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la-moy, je croiray sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"13\">qui ne fait rire que l'esprit.</span></span> Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, repliquay-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"14\">j'aye parlé de Philosophie</span></span> à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse. Cherchez ailleurs des Philosophes </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day. I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self. Well, says she, since your Folly is so delightful, pray let me have a share in it, I'l believe what you please of the Stars, provided I find pleasure in it. Ah! Madam, said I, 'tis not a pleasure like that which you find in a Comedy of Moliere; 'tis a pleasure, I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind. And pray, says she, do you think me incapable of pleasures that are only in the Reason; bring me acquainted with your Stars, and you shall presently see the contrary. No, said I, it shall never be laid to my charge, that in a Grove, at ten of clock at night, I entertain'd the most lovely person in the World with nothing but Philosophy, look out for such Philosophers elsewhere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day.

The translation \"withdrew my Admiration from\" changes this to a more detached, intellectual act of shifting attention, lessening the intensity of the philosopher's original state and his connection to the cosmic spectacle, thereby altering the perceived depth of his engagement.","The French \"Brunes\" refers to dark-haired women (brunettes), and \"vous qui ne l'estes pas\" means \"you who are not it (brune)\". The translation \"the black\" is ambiguous, and \"who have so little of it in your self\" (referring to the blonde Marquise) changes the clear categorical distinction in the original to a graded one, implying the Marquise possesses a small amount of \"blackness\" or darkness. This alters the nature of the comparison and the Marquise's characteristics.","The French \"resverie\" implies a gentle, dream-like state or daydreaming. The translation \"Contemplation\" suggests a more active, intellectual, and deliberate thought process. This subtly shifts the nature of the experience from passive absorption to active mental engagement, altering the tone of the philosopher's musings towards a more rationalized state.","Similar to the previous instance, \"resver\" (to be in a reverie, to dream) is translated as \"contemplation.\" The original suggests the Marquise would inspire an even more profound dream-like state. The translation changes this to a \"deeper contemplation,\" emphasizing intellectual activity over imaginative reverie, which subtly alters the tone and the description of the philosopher's reaction, making it seem more analytical.","The original French, \"Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens,\" means \"The night must indeed receive their thanks\" or \"It's fitting that the night has their thanks.\" The translation \"'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them\" shifts the philosopher's response from an observation about night receiving thanks to an added causal explanation (because it \"obliges them\"), altering the logic of the dialogue and inserting a reason not present in the original.","The French \"apparemment\" means \"apparently\" or \"seemingly,\" indicating conjecture on the philosopher's part. The translation \"'tis certain\" changes this to an expression of definite conviction. This alters the philosopher's tone from speculative to assertive, misrepresenting his expressed level of certainty and potentially making his claims sound more dogmatic.","The French \"l'on en resve mieux\" means \"one dreams/reveries better about them.\" The translation \"we can muse better on them\" again substitutes \"resver\" (to dream, to be in a reverie) with \"muse\" (to ponder). This consistent substitution downplays the imaginative, dream-like quality of the experience described by Fontenelle, replacing it with a more contemplative, intellectual activity.","The French \"favorise la resverie\" means \"favors reverie\" or \"promotes daydreaming.\" The translation \"indulges our Contemplation\" replaces \"resverie\" with \"Contemplation,\" reinforcing the pattern of shifting the described mental state from a passive, imaginative one to a more active, intellectual one. Additionally, \"indulges\" is a stronger verb than \"favorise,\" subtly altering the dynamic.","The French \"tous ces Mondes\" means \"all these Worlds,\" emphasizing the totality of the philosopher's vision. The translation \"so many Worlds\" is less absolute and slightly diminishes the grand, all-encompassing scale of the idea, subtly weakening the impact of the philosopher's imaginative leap and the revolutionary scope of plurality.","The French \"mon imagination s'est échapée\" means \"my imagination escaped\" or \"ran away,\" vividly portraying the spontaneous nature of the philosopher's imaginative leap. The translation \"I as soon discovered it\" (referring to his folly) completely changes this meaning to suggest a moment of self-realization about his folly, rather than the flight of imagination itself. This tames the portrayal of his creative thought process, making it seem more controlled.","The original \"Helas... je suis bien fâché\" conveys regret and reluctance (\"Alas... I am very sorry/vexed\"). The translation \"Faith... I find my self necessitated\" changes this tone significantly. \"Faith\" is a different interjection, and \"necessitated to acknowledge\" removes the emotional nuance of being \"fâché\" (vexed/sorry), replacing it with a sense of compulsion, altering the perceived emotional state of the philosopher.","The French \"me réjoüit\" (delights me/makes me joyful) suggests a deep pleasure. The translation \"tickles\" is more superficial and whimsical, potentially trivializing the intellectual and emotional satisfaction the philosopher derives from his idea. Furthermore, \"d'une maniere riante\" (in a smiling/cheerful manner), which personifies the idea's entry, is generalized to \"with delight,\" losing the specific cheerful imagery.","The original French states that \"pleasantness/charm (l'agrément) is necessary (ne soit necessaire) even for Truths.\" The translation changes \"l'agrément\" to the stronger \"delight\" and, more significantly, alters \"necessaire\" (necessary) to \"is not amiss.\" This drastically weakens Fontenelle's assertion, changing an essential condition for presenting truth into something merely acceptable, thereby undermining a core tenet of his popularizing methodology.","The French \"qui ne fait rire que l'esprit\" literally means \"which only makes the mind/intellect laugh,\" a witty expression for intellectual amusement. The translation \"and delights only the Mind\" is more generic and loses the specific, playful imagery of the mind \"laughing.\" This change diminishes the charming, light-hearted tone characteristic of Fontenelle's style.","The original French \"j'aye parlé de Philosophie\" simply means \"I spoke of Philosophy.\" The translation \"I entertain'd... with nothing but Philosophy\" changes the verb and adds the restrictive phrase \"nothing but.\" This addition frames \"Philosophy\" as a potentially dry or all-consuming topic, implying it would be an inappropriate or unappealing form of \"entertainment,\" a nuance less prominent in the more neutral original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne sçavois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle qui ne sçavoit rien en matiere de Phisique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit estre une Planete; &amp; les Planetes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des Mondes. J'en revenois toûjours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en nostre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes; &amp; si d'un autre costé vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le sçavoir, ce qui reviendrait au mesme. Mais on veut sçavoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est-là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera. Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">s'inquiete d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté.</span></span> Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées</span></span>, &amp; elles le sont si bien, qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers; car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles.</span></span> Suposons qu'ils voyoient le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent, qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre</span></span>; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; &amp; cent autres resveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique? Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties. Avoüez la verité. N'avez-vous point eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne meritoit? J'ay vû des gens qui l'en estimoyent moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoyent connu. Et moy, repliqua-t-elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sçay qu'il ressemble à une Montre. Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples. </p><p>P005: Je ne sçay pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en verité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la teste un faux Merveilleux</span></span> envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent.

Mais, Madame, continuay-je, vous estes si bien disposée à entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire, que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, &amp; à vous montrer le Monde.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected.

When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty.

This choice of word overdramatizes the simple hiddenness of nature's mechanisms, potentially imbuing them with a sense of intentional, almost furtive concealment not suggested by Fontenelle's straightforward language.","The translation of \"tous ces Gens\" (all these people/folk) as \"all that learned crew\" introduces a potentially demeaning connotation. While \"crew\" can mean a group, it often carries informal or slightly derogatory overtones (e.g., a disorderly group). Applying this to revered ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle subtly diminishes their stature more sharply than Fontenelle's somewhat ironic but less dismissive phrasing, potentially reflecting the Enlightenment's re-evaluation of classical authority but with a harsher edge.","The original \"une certaine amitié\" (a certain friendship) is a clear use of personification by Fontenelle to satirize the anthropomorphic explanations of ancient philosophy regarding Phaeton's movement. Translating this as \"a certain natural Propensity\" replaces the vivid, almost comically absurd personification with a more formal, pseudo-philosophical term. This shift mutes the satirical edge, making the ancient explanation sound less like an emotional fancy and more like a (still flawed) abstract principle, thereby altering the critical and humorous tone of the original.","The translation changes \"Assez de Gens\" (Many people/A good number of people) to \"We shall daily meet with people\". The addition of \"daily\" is an exaggeration not present in the original, significantly intensifying the stated frequency of encountering people who adhere to a \"false kind of Wonder.\" This shift could subtly manipulate the reader into perceiving opposition to enlightened ideas as more pervasive and constant than Fontenelle's original, perhaps to heighten the sense of urgency or cultural struggle against perceived ignorance or superstition, resonant with English societal tensions of the late 17th century."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

The English translation \"wheels them along with it\" omits a direct equivalent for \"avec foy,\" thereby losing the explicit emphasis on the regularity, dependability, or inherent orderliness of this celestial movement. This omission simplifies the description to a more purely mechanical one and subtly alters the tone and connotation of the original statement, potentially stripping away a layer of meaning that could imply a divinely maintained or inherently trustworthy order.","The French \"reconnoistre son champ\" means to recognize or identify one's field. The translation \"to lay out his own Field\" shifts the meaning from an act of cognitive identification (distinguishing pre-existing but confused boundaries) to one of practical demarcation or re-establishment of boundaries. This subtly alters the original meaning by changing the perceived nature of the problem that geometry initially solved, framing it as more about active construction or definition rather than epistemic recognition.","The repeated French metaphorical structure \"X est fille de Y\" (X is daughter of Y), which lends a literary charm and accessibility to Fontenelle's writing, is consistently translated with more formal and abstract phrasings like \"X derives it self from Y\" or \"X draws its Original from Y\". This systematic change alters the original's engaging, popularizing tone to a more academic and less vivid one, thereby diminishing the literary charm and accessibility that were key to Fontenelle's popularization of science, especially for a non-specialist audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien-aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie. La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus interessée que je ne l'ay, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne, &amp; nous y menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraye vie pastorale que de parler des Planetes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaist, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe.</span></span> Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible</span></span>, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible.</span></span> Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">apparemment fort peu devot</span></span>, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">La pensée est trop libertine</span></span>, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">deux ou trois Cieux superflus</span></span> qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide.</span></span> Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere</span></span>, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais.</span></span> Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées.

Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides</span></span> qui avoyent esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pieces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">où elle s'estoit placée</span></span>, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvemens qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"11\">de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner</span></span>, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle.

C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">that the ancient System is not at all tenable.</span></span> But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">World</span></span>, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye.</span></span> Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">to me it seems as decent as intelligible</span></span>; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it.

The translation 'jejunely' (dryly, insipidly, lacking substance) makes their answer sound significantly weaker and more intellectually barren. This subtly intensifies the critique of the anthropocentric philosophers by portraying their reasoning as not just detached but also demonstrably poor.","The French 'net' (clear, neat, distinct) emphasizes the clarity and intelligibility of the old system for the Marquise. The translation 'decent' (fitting, proper, seemly) introduces a judgment of propriety. This shifts the Marquise's appreciation from the system's logical comprehensibility to its perceived appropriateness or conformity with traditional views of order, subtly aligning the old system with values beyond mere rationality.","The French 'épouvante horrible' (horrible fright/terror) conveys a strong sense of dread regarding the complexity of the Ptolemaic system. The translation 'astonish'd' significantly weakens this emotional impact, downplaying the difficulty and scariness of the old system, thereby making it seem less problematic and the need for a new, simpler system less compelling.","The French 'apparemment fort peu devot' (apparently not very devout/pious) is a relatively mild assessment of the King of Aragon's piety. The translation 'something irreligious' is a stronger and more negative term. In the English socio-religious context of the late 17th century, labeling someone 'irreligious' carried more severe connotations, potentially discrediting the King and his critical thought more forcefully.","The original French 'La pensée est trop libertine' states that the *thought itself* is too 'libertine' (free-thinking, overly bold). The translation shifts this to ''Twas the expression of a Libertine,' labeling the King *himself* as 'a Libertine.' This personalizes and intensifies the condemnation, as 'Libertine' was a loaded term with strong negative moral and social connotations, thus more harshly judging the questioner of the old system.","The French 'deux ou trois Cieux superflus' indicates an indefinite small number ('two or three') of superfluous heavens. The translation 'those three superfluous Heavens' changes this to a specific number, 'three.' This adds a level of definiteness and unsubstantiated factual detail not present in the original, subtly altering the information conveyed about the ancient cosmological model.","The French 'il a falu se resoudre à faire' (it was necessary to resolve to make / one had to decide to make) emphasizes that the shift to fluid heavens was a reasoned decision driven by scientific necessity (observations of comets). The translation 'it has been thought more convenient to make' significantly weakens this, suggesting the change was merely a matter of convenience rather than a compelling scientific imperative. This downplays the force of observational evidence against the old model.","The French 'Il sembleroit' (It would seem) indicates a tentative, speculative observation by the Marquise. The translation 'I see' makes her statement more direct, assertive, and conclusive. This alters the portrayal of the Marquise, making her sound more certain and less of a cautious, thoughtful inquirer than in the original text.","The French 'Il n'y a rien de plus beau' (There is nothing more beautiful) praises the aesthetic quality of Nature's efficient design. The translation 'There is nothing more commendable' (praiseworthy) shifts the appreciation from an aesthetic judgment (beauty) to a moral or intellectual one (praiseworthiness). This subtly changes the grounds for valuing Nature's economy, emphasizing its worthiness of praise rather than its inherent beauty.","The French 'fait main-basse sur' (idiomatically: makes a clean sweep of, destroys, plunders) conveys a sense of radical, forceful, and thorough destruction of the old cosmological models by Copernicus. The translation 'pull'd down' is significantly milder and less aggressive, taming the revolutionary and iconoclastic impact of Copernicus's actions described in the original.","The French 'où elle s'estoit placée' (where it had placed itself) subtly implies a degree of agency, or even presumption, on the Earth's part in its central position, aligning with Fontenelle's critique of anthropocentric 'folly'. The translation 'where it had long been fixt' renders Earth's position as passive and neutral, removing the original's nuanced suggestion of Earth's self-assumed importance.","The French 'se faisoit accompagner & environner' (caused itself to be accompanied and surrounded) again implies an active, perhaps presumptuous, role for the Earth in orchestrating its celestial attendance. The translation 'which attended and surrounded' makes Earth a passive recipient. This, like the previous point, removes the original's subtle criticism of Earth's perceived self-importance within the old cosmology.","The French 'il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme' (an enthusiasm has just seized you) describes a momentary passionate eloquence. The English 'you are fallen into an Enthusiasm' could carry more negative connotations for a late 17th-century English audience, where 'Enthusiasm' (especially if capitalized as it often was) was frequently associated with irrational religious zeal or fanaticism, particularly in the charged religious climate of the time. This might subtly cast the philosopher's passionate advocacy for new science in a more suspect light."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient.

Very well, says she, do you think the Vanity of men extends to Astronomy? or that I am more troubled because I understand that the Earth moves about the Sun? I profess, I do not at all esteem my self less. Madam, said I, I know well that no man will be so scrupulous of taking place in the Universe, as in a Chamber, nor will the precedency of two Planets be a matter of so great dispute as that of two Ambassadours.

Faith he died; He had no mind to withstand all the Contradiction he knew it would meet with, and therefore wisely withdrew. But hark you, said the Marchioness, we must do justice to all the World: it is certainly very difficult to believe that we turn; for I cannot see that we change place, and we find our selves in the morning where we lay down at night. I find, methinks, in your face that you are going to tell me, that as the whole body of the Earth moves-Most true, said I, interrupting her, 'tis the same thing as if you slept upon the River in a Boat, you would find your self at waking in the same place and same scituation in respect of the parts of the Boat. Allow'd, says she, but here's the difference, I should find at waking the Banks of the River chang'd, and from thence I should find that my Boat had chang'd place. But 'tis not so with the Earth, I find all things there just as I left them. No, no, Madam, said I, the Banks change also. You know that beyond all those Circles of the Planets are the fixed Stars, those are our Banks. I am upon the Earth, and the Earth describes a great Circle about the Sun. I look towards the center of that Circle, and see there the Sun: if the Stars were then to be seen, in looking on in a straight line beyond the Sun, I must needs see which of the fixed Stars answer'd to him; but I easily see in the night, which of the Stars answer'd to him in the day, which is exactly the same thing. If the Earth did not change place in the Circle where she is, I should see the Sun every day answering the same fixed Stars; but since she changes place, I must needs find him answer to others. There's the Bank that changes every day, and as the Earth performs her Circle in one year, I see the Sun in the space of one year answer a whole Circle of fixed Stars. That Circle is call'd the Zodiack; if you please, Ile draw you a Figure here in the dust. No, no, says she, I shall do well enough without it: besides it will give my Park an Air of Philosophy, which I have no mind to.

I find, methinks, in your face that you are going to tell me, that as the whole body of the Earth moves-Most true, said I, interrupting her, 'tis the same thing as if you slept upon the River in a Boat, you would find your self at waking in the same place and same scituation in respect of the parts of the Boat. Allow'd, says she, but here's the difference, I should find at waking the Banks of the River chang'd, and from thence I should find that my Boat had chang'd place. But 'tis not so with the Earth, I find all things there just as I left them. No, no, Madam, said I, the Banks change also. You know that beyond all those Circles of the Planets are the fixed Stars, those are our Banks. I am upon the Earth, and the Earth describes a great Circle about the Sun. I look towards the center of that Circle, and see there the Sun: if the Stars were then to be seen, in looking on in a straight line beyond the Sun, I must needs see which of the fixed Stars answer'd to him; but I easily see in the night, which of the Stars answer'd to him in the day, which is exactly the same thing. If the Earth did not change place in the Circle where she is, I should see the Sun every day answering the same fixed Stars; but since she changes place, I must needs find him answer to others. There's the Bank that changes every day, and as the Earth performs her Circle in one year, I see the Sun in the space of one year answer a whole Circle of fixed Stars.

The translation 'I profess' is significantly weaker and more formal, altering the Marquise's tone from one of firm conviction to a more measured declaration. This softening could subtly manipulate the reader's perception of her character, possibly to align with English sensibilities of the period regarding oaths.","The omission of 'Mon Dieu' (My God), a common French interjection expressing surprise or emphasis, from the philosopher's speech ('Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je') makes his response 'Madam, said I' more formal and less emotive in English. This alteration subtly changes the philosopher's expressive tone, potentially to avoid religious sensitivities in the English context.","The translation of 'Franchement,' (Frankly, Honestly,) as 'Oh!' (an interjection of surprise or mild objection) diminishes the force and directness of the Marquise's retort. 'Franchement' implies a candid, forthright statement, and its replacement by 'Oh!' alters her perceived personality and the tone of the dialogue.","Translating 'une calomnie' (a calumny, i.e., a false and defamatory statement) as 'a downright scandal' (which can be a true but shocking event/claim, intensified by 'downright') alters the specific nature of the Marquise's accusation. The original implies she's calling out a falsehood ('inventée' - invented); the translation suggests she's more shocked by the claim's audacity, subtly shifting the reader's understanding of her objection.","The insertion of the interjection 'Faith' before 'he died' (French: 'Il mourut.') introduces a colloquialism and an emphatic particle common in 17th-century English, absent in the original's stark statement. This subtly anglicizes the narration, making it more conversational and less direct, thereby altering the tone of this dramatic moment.","Translating 'sable' (sand) as 'dust' when the philosopher offers to draw a figure ('figure sur le sable?') subtly alters the setting's imagery. 'Sable' in the context of a park ('mon Parc') clearly refers to the sand or fine gravel of a path. 'Dust' evokes a less specific, potentially less kempt or less formal environment, slightly shifting the reader's perception of the scene.","The French 'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là' suggests it is not fitting, appropriate, or her place (as a Marquise) to be seen making such 'traces' (mathematical drawings). The translation 'it is not for my credit to make such steps here' shifts the emphasis to her reputation or social standing. The original focuses on social propriety and role, while the translation emphasizes potential damage to her public image, subtly altering the motivation behind the Marquise's reluctance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voye que des pas d'Amans, c'est à dire, vostre nom &amp; vos chiffres gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs.

This conveys the Marquise's witty, slightly reluctant acceptance of the new, demanding model. The translation, \"She is not easily movable,\" replaces this nuanced, personified complaint with a factual statement about the Earth's physical inertia. This shift in meaning alters the Marquise's tone, making her remark less about the perceived \"imposition\" on the Earth and more a simple observation of physical difficulty, thereby subtly changing the reader's perception of her character and the nature of her engagement with the scientific ideas.","The original French, \"nous fait paroistre dans leur cours des bizarreries,\" means \"makes irregularities/oddities appear to us in their (the planets') course.\" This correctly explains that our motion as observers causes the planets' paths to appear irregular. The translation, \"makes us seem to be in their course of extravagance,\" significantly alters this meaning. It incorrectly suggests that we (the observers or Earth) are perceived as being part of or located within an irregular \"course of extravagance\" related to the planets. This misrepresents the core astronomical concept being explained—that perceived planetary irregularities are optical effects due to the observer's own motion—and could confuse the reader about the heliocentric model's explanation for these phenomena. The term \"extravagance\" for \"bizarreries\" (irregularities) is plausible for the period, but the syntactic restructuring fundamentally changes what is being described as appearing irregular."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P010: Oh! repliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">le mouvement ne leur coúte rien;</span></span> mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">la Terre ne paroît guere portative.</span></span> Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'experience, que ce fust quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'un gros Navire monté de cent-cinquante pieces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une tres-grande nombre de Marchãdises?

The translation \"That's not to be allow'd\" changes the philosopher's tone to be more authoritative and prohibitive, rather than explanatory, subtly altering the reader's perception of his character and the nature of the dialogue.","The original \"une piroüette aussi legere\" (such a light pirouette) evokes an image of graceful, almost dance-like motion. Replacing \"pirouette\" with \"Shuttlecock or Whirligigg\"—common toys, one of which (shuttlecock) does not primarily spin—introduces a more mundane, less elegant, and potentially clumsy or childish imagery for the Earth's movement. This change diminishes the sophistication of the Marquise's analogy and subtly alters the tone of her concern.","The French \"nous sommes assez inconsiderez\" (we are rather/quite thoughtless/rash) is part of the Marquise's general reflection. The addition of the explicit phrase \"in my opinion\" in the English translation, for which 'assez' (rather/quite) is not a direct equivalent in terms of explicit attribution, frames this statement more strongly as her personal, subjective viewpoint. This lessens its impact as a broader critique of Copernicans, making it seem more like a personal thought rather than a considered observation.","The French phrase \"vous tournerez avec plaisir\" (you will turn/spin with pleasure), which directly precedes \"& vous vous ferez...\" (and you will form...) in the source segment, is omitted in the translation. The English target segment \"and have delightful Idea's of this System.\" translates only the latter part of the French conjunction. This omission removes the philosopher's assurance that the Marquise will find pleasure in the act of 'turning' (adopting the new astronomy), a key aspect of Fontenelle's popularizing strategy of making science enjoyable, thereby altering the philosopher's persuasive and encouraging tone.","The French \"tous ces visages differens\" (all these different faces) creates a direct, human-centric image of the world's diverse populations. Translating \"visages\" (faces) as \"appearances\" makes the vision more abstract and depersonalized.

The translation \"so that\" reframes this deduction. It makes the statement \"in the same place... other people are continually passing\" appear as a result or outcome flowing from the idea that \"it would be four and twenty hours well spent to see all this.\" This subtly manipulates the reader's understanding by shifting the logical basis of the Marquise's realization from an objective astronomical fact to a consequence related to the act or value of observation.","The French \"d'autres Peuples\" (plural of 'peuple') in this context refers to distinct groups of inhabitants, such as different nations or populations from various parts of the Earth, successively passing a specific point in space due to the planet's rotation. The translation \"other people\" is more generic, typically denoting individuals rather than organized or distinct collective entities. This generalization subtly alters the original meaning by diminishing the emphasis on the diversity of human societies. It shifts the perception from a grand image of varied cultures and nations participating in this cosmic cycle to a more undifferentiated stream of individuals, potentially lessening the impact of Fontenelle's broader theme of plurality and the expanding 17th-century worldview."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.

The translation 'granting all at first sight?' introduces a question mark, transforming an assertion into a query or an expression of the narrator's surprise/disbelief. This manipulates the reader's perception by altering the original's tone and introducing doubt or moral questioning not present in Fontenelle's text.","The French 'des resveries' (daydreams, musings, speculations) in Fontenelle's work often carries a light, charming, and philosophical connotation related to their discussions.

The translation \"This [the Air] and all the other Cod of the Silkworm\" introduces ambiguity and potential misinterpretation. \"Other Cod\" illogically suggests a separate or additional cocoon, or clumsily refers to the rest of the current one, obscuring the original's clear image of a single, unified system (Earth and atmosphere) turning together. This can manipulate the reader's understanding of the scientific analogy.","The French \"une si grande agitation\" implies significant turmoil, unrest, or commotion, and can also refer to political or social upheaval. The translation \"make such a noise\" reduces this to mere sound or clamor. This trivializes the original's depiction of human endeavors and their impact, diminishing the scale and seriousness of the \"agitation\" and stripping it of potential social or political connotations, thereby altering the reader's perception of the human condition as critiqued by the Marquise.","The original French \"me sont un peu suspectes\" means the philosopher's precautions \"seem a bit suspicious to me,\" directly questioning their validity or honesty. The translation \"I am still very doubtful\" shifts the emphasis from a critique of the precautions to the Marquise's internal state of uncertainty. This subtly weakens her critical stance, making her appear less challenging of the philosopher's methods and potentially manipulating the reader's perception of her intellectual acuity or the dynamic of the dialogue.","\"Baailler\" (modern \"bâiller\") means \"to yawn,\" indicating that the Marquise finds the philosopher's moralizing during a scientific discussion boring and unwelcome. The translation \"Bantring\" (bantering) suggests a light-hearted, teasing exchange. This substitution fundamentally changes the Marquise's expressed reaction, replacing a clear signal of tedium and dismissal with a word implying playful conversation, thus altering the tone and the nature of her critique."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: En retournant au Château je luy dis <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes</span></span>, qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Ticho- Brahé qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fust immobile, la plaçoit au centre du Monde, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planetes, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planetes autour de la Terre.

The translation \"was of opinion\" softens this, suggesting she merely held a belief rather than reached a firm conclusion through reasoning. This subtly diminishes the perceived force of her intellectual agency and decisiveness, which Fontenelle aimed to highlight in a female character engaging with scientific ideas.","The original French uses direct address (\"vous persuade\" – persuades you; \"vous fait plaisir\" – gives you pleasure), engaging the Marquise (and by extension, the reader) personally. The translation omits the direct object \"vous,\" rendering the statements impersonal (\"persuades,\" \"delights\"). This alters Fontenelle's characteristic intimate and conversational tone, which was crucial for his popularizing strategy, especially in making science accessible and relatable to a lay audience, including women.

The English translation 'and they were obliging in that too' shifts the focus to the visitors' action or quality of being accommodating, subtly altering the social dynamic and the portrayal of agency in the courtesy.","The French 'Pourtant' (however, yet, nevertheless) introduces the Marquise's statement as a contrast or reservation to the philosopher's ongoing discourse. The translation to 'Truly' changes this adversative nuance to one of simple affirmation or sincerity, altering the tone and the logical connection of her remark, potentially making her appear less critically engaged.","The French 'des ménagemens avec ses Ennemis mesmes' (tactful dealings/careful handling even with one's Enemies) implies prudent diplomacy and caution. The translation to 'an Intrigue with the very Enemy' introduces a significantly stronger connotation of clandestine plotting, machination, or deceit. This escalates the nature of the philosopher's analogy, potentially making his approach seem more manipulative or politically charged, especially within the English socio-political context of the late 17th century.","The French 'quoyque je voye la Lune habitée' (although I see [present subjunctive implying current conviction/perception] the Moon inhabited) expresses the philosopher's current belief. The translation 'though I should see the Moon inhabited' employs a conditional construction, weakening the philosopher's asserted conviction into something more hypothetical or less certain. This subtly manipulates the reader's perception by making the controversial scientific idea seem less confidently held by its proponent, potentially to soften its impact."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P022: Suposons qu'il n'y ait jamais eu nul commerce entre Paris &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Saint-Denis</span></span>, &amp; qu'un Bourgeois de Paris qui ne sera jamais sorty de sa Ville, soit sur les Tours de Nostre Dame, &amp; voye Saint Denis de loin, on luy demandera s'il croit que Saint Denis soit habité comme Paris.

The addition of the adjective 'honest' is not present in the source.

The English \"a good thought\" is considerably more casual, vague, and less intellectual. This alteration softens the Marquise's character, portraying her sentiment as a fleeting positive notion rather than a diminishing intellectual position, subtly changing the tone of her engagement with the topic and potentially downplaying her intellectual seriousness for the English audience.","The French \"Animaux\" (Animals) encompasses all animal life. The English translation narrows this to \"Cattel,\" which specifically refers to domesticated bovine animals or livestock generally. This substitution makes the Earth's perceived utility more narrowly agricultural and mundane, diminishing the broader biological and philosophical scope implied by Fontenelle. It subtly shifts the perception of Earth from a diverse habitat to a mere pasture, aligning with a potentially more utilitarian or less scientifically expansive contemporary English worldview.","The French \"Il faudroit estre\" (It would be necessary to be / One would have to be) conveys a strong sense of necessity or a required condition for true, objective understanding. The English translation \"better it would be\" reframes this as a preference or a more desirable, but not necessarily essential, state. This shift in modality lessens the philosophical force of Fontenelle's assertion about the nature of observation, making the ideal of a detached \"Spectator\" sound like a wistful improvement rather than a fundamental prerequisite for objective judgment, potentially softening a radical epistemological point for the English readership.","The French \"& de s'imaginer\" (and to imagine / leading to imagine) is an impersonal infinitive construction, suggesting a general tendency or a natural consequence of the Moon's libration being misinterpreted. The English translation transforms this by adding the philosopher's colloquial and assertive guarantee (\"Now I'le undertake,\" i.e., \"I'll wager/assure you\") and by making \"she\" (the Moon/its inhabitants) the active subject who \"imputes\" its own motion (\"that wavering\") to the Earth and then \"imagines.\" This significantly alters the philosopher's tone from detached, scientific explanation to opinionated, personal assertion, and makes the Lunarians' misinterpretation seem more like an active, almost willful act rather than a passive perceptual error."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P026: Toutes ces Planetes, dit la Marquise, sont faites comme nous, qui rejettons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mesmes.

In the English socio-political context of the late 1680s, marked by religious tensions under James II, \"Reformation\" would strongly evoke the Protestant Reformation and contemporary fears of religious upheaval. This capitalization and specific word choice transforms the philosopher's advice against meddling in minor errors into a warning against attempting large-scale, potentially religious or political, reforms, subtly manipulating the reader by invoking contemporary anxieties.","The French \"toûjours\" (always) in the phrase \"Il y a donc toûjours une moitié... qui a le jour\" (So there is always one half... which has day) accurately describes the continuous state of one hemisphere being illuminated. The translation changes this to \"Then the Sun daily enlightens one half... 'tis day\", introducing \"daily\" and shifting the grammatical structure. This alters the meaning from a constant state of being (a half always *has* day) to a recurring action performed by the Sun (*daily enlightens*), subtly manipulating the reader's understanding of the described astronomical principle by emphasizing a temporal cycle over a constant geometric reality.","The original French states that a ball has \"moins de force & de vistesse\" (less force and speed) after impact. The translation states it \"loses its force,\" effectively reducing the two components \"force & de vistesse\" to just \"force.\" This omission of \"vistesse\" (speed) makes the analogy to light (which loses intensity/force upon reflection, but not speed in a given medium) seem more direct by removing a component of the ball's behavior (loss of speed) that doesn't map perfectly to light's reflection. This subtly manipulates the analogy by making it appear more fitting through omission of a dissonant detail.","The French idiom \"Nous n'avons garde de voir\" conveys that \"we certainly do not see\" or \"there is no chance of our seeing\" the unlit half, emphasizing the impossibility of perception due to lack of light. The translation \"We do not look to see\" changes this to imply a lack of effort or intention on the part of the observer (\"we don't try/aim to see it\"). This subtly shifts the agency, suggesting human choice or inaction rather than a physical constraint as the reason for not seeing the dark side, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the observational limit.","The French \"nous sommes en Decours pour elles\" literally means \"we (the Earth) are in a waning phase for them (the Moon's inhabitants),\" an astronomical term describing the decreasing visibility of Earth's illuminated portion from the Moon. The translation \"and we are running from them\" drastically alters this scientific description into an active, almost animate image of the Earth or its inhabitants fleeing. This introduces a strong sense of agency and dramatic movement (\"running from\") entirely absent from the original's passive, observational term \"en Decours\" (waning), thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the celestial phenomenon by personifying it and changing its nature."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je sçauray tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.

The translation 'will never understand them' changes this to an absolute impossibility, subtly portraying these 'Peuples' as inherently incapable of understanding, which can reinforce a sense of cultural or intellectual superiority in the reader.","The French 'Griffes fort noires' (very black claws) is translated to 'black Paws'. The omission of the intensifier 'fort' (very) and the change from 'Griffes' (claws, suggesting sharpness and aggression) to 'Paws' (generally softer, less threatening animals' feet) subtly diminishes the ferocity of the demon imagined by the East Indians. This alteration can make their belief seem less grounded in genuine terror and perhaps more naive or fanciful.","The French 'tres-devote' (very devout) is intensified to the superlative 'the most devout' in the English translation. This exaggeration subtly makes the religious practice of the Indians seem more extreme or singular in its intensity, potentially reinforcing a perception of their customs as excessively or irrationally zealous from an Enlightenment-era European perspective.","The original French states the Indians' aim is 'à obtenir du Soleil & de la Lune qu'ils se défendent bien contre le Démon' (to obtain from the Sun and the Moon that they defend themselves well against the Demon). The translation changes this to having the Sun and Moon 'to protect them [the Indians]'. This significant shift alters the perceived nature of the ritual and the Indians' relationship with the celestial bodies, changing it from an appeal for the deities' self-preservation to an appeal for the worshippers' protection. This subtly changes the focus of the 'superstition' from concern for the cosmic entities to a more self-interested plea, potentially making the practice seem more primitive or self-serving.","The consistent shift from the French past/imperfect tenses (e.g., 'on estoit persuadé' - one was persuaded, 'estoient fâchéz' - were angry, 'on ne faisoit pas' - one didn't do) to the English present tense (e.g., 'think', 'are angry', 'do not') throughout this description of the 'Americans' subtly alters perception. It frames their beliefs and practices as current and ongoing rather than as historical customs, which could contribute to an Enlightenment-era, and potentially colonial, view of these cultures as static, unchanging, and 'timelessly' primitive in contrast to a progressive Europe."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P029: En verité, reprit-elle, tout cela est trop honteux pour les hommes, il devroit y avoir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">un Arrest du Genre humain</span></span> qui défendît qu'on parlast jamais d'Eclipse, de peur que l'on ne conserve la memoyre des sotises qui ont esté faites ou dites sur ce Chapitre-là.

This omission shifts the perception of the decree's origin: it is no longer a self-imposed rule by humanity but rather an edict from an unspecified authority that is general in nature. Furthermore, the choice of the word 'Edict' in late 17th-century England, a period marked by controversial royal edicts such as James II's Declaration of Indulgence, could subtly charge the term with contemporary political connotations, altering the reader's understanding of the proposed ban's source and nature away from the original's collective or even democratic implication.","The French 'de quelque sotise des hommes' means 'of some folly of men' or 'of any particular folly of men,' with 'quelque' (some, any, a certain) pointing to unspecified, particular instances or a certain kind/amount of foolishness. The English translation 'of the Folly of mankind' employs the definite article 'the' and capitalizes 'Folly' (as per the provided target text). This transforms 'sotise' from multiple, indefinite instances into a singular, abstract, and reified concept – 'the Folly' as a grand, overarching characteristic. This subtly alters the meaning and tone, making the philosopher's observation about human foolishness sound more absolute, definitive, and generalized than the original French, which allows for more nuance and particularity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P030: Dites-moy, je vous prie, une chose, dit la Marquise.

The translation changes this to \"of Fools that adore,\" replacing the descriptive behavioral clause with a categorical label (\"Fools\"). This shift makes the statement more direct and pejorative, altering the tone and presenting the individuals as inherently foolish rather than men acting foolishly in this specific context.","The original French \"donner des crises à ses Malades\" translates to \"give crises to its [the Moon's] sick people/patients,\" indicating a direct influence on the individuals. The English translation \"give the Crises to their Diseases\" shifts the object of the action from the people to their illnesses. This subtly alters the meaning by depersonalizing the supposed influence, making it seem directed at abstract conditions rather than directly at the Moon's inhabitants, which could shift the reader's perception of the nature of this superstitious belief."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P031: Ne craignez rien, répondis-je, il n'y a pas d'apparence que nous soyons la seule sotte espece <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">de l'Univers</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à estre generalement répanduë</span></span>, &amp; quoy que je ne fasse que deviner celle des Gens de la Lune, je n'en doute non plus que des Nouvelles les plus seures qui nous viennent de là.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P026: Fear not, said I, it doth not appear that we are the only foolish Species in the World.

The translation 'in the World,' while capable of meaning 'cosmos' in some historical contexts, more commonly refers to Earth or a less specific domain in general usage. This choice can subtly diminish the grand scale of Fontenelle's speculation. In a work dedicated to expanding the reader's view to the plurality of worlds within the universe, using a term that might be interpreted more narrowly can manipulate the reader's perception by making Fontenelle's ideas seem less expansive or radical than intended.","The French 'L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à estre generalement répanduë' translates to 'Ignorance is something quite apt/suited/prone to be generally widespread,' which is an observation about ignorance's natural tendency to spread, possibly delivered with irony. The English translation 'Ignorance is a certain Good proper to be generally diffus'd' fundamentally alters this meaning. It incorrectly interprets 'bien propre à' (very apt to) as 'un certain Bien' (a certain Good) and 'propre à' (proper/fitting to). This transforms Fontenelle's observation into a positive assertion that ignorance is itself a 'Good' and that it is 'proper' (fitting or right) for this 'Good' to be spread. This is a significant manipulation, as it changes Fontenelle's likely critical or ironic tone into an endorsement of ignorance, misrepresenting his philosophical stance, especially as an Enlightenment figure promoting reason."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P032: Et quelles sont ces Nouvelles seures? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">interrompit-elle</span></span>.

The translation \"says she\" omits this specific action, neutralizing her speech act and subtly altering the perception of her character's assertiveness and the conversational dynamic.","The French \"voyagent tous les jours\" (travel every day) attributes daily frequency directly to the scholars' act of travelling to make observations. The English translation \"travel thither\" (in the clause \"who travel thither\") omits this explicit daily frequency for the travel itself. Although the news is described as \"daily brought,\" removing \"tous les jours\" from the act of travelling subtly diminishes the portrayal of the scientists' continuous, diligent efforts.","The French \"de tres-hautes Montagnes\" (of very high mountains) provides a direct dimensional description.

By reducing this to simply \"her inequalitys,\" the translation downplays the strength and clarity of the observational evidence Fontenelle presents, potentially leading the reader to perceive the scientific deductions as based on less compelling or obvious features.","The translation of \"presque tous\" (almost all) as \"generally\" subtly alters the meaning and weakens the claim made by Fontenelle. \"Presque tous\" implies a very high proportion, nearing totality, of lunar features being named after scholars. \"Generally\" is less specific and can suggest a more common or usual occurrence rather than an almost complete one. This change diminishes the emphasis on the overwhelming dominance of scientific figures in the nomenclature of the Moon, potentially softening the portrayal of science's reach and impact in this new domain of knowledge.","The addition of \"the Streets of\" to the phrase \"dans Paris\" (in Paris) alters the scope of the comparison. While navigating \"Paris\" inherently involves its streets, the original \"dans Paris\" allows for a more general sense of familiarity and orientation within the city as a whole. The translation \"in the Streets of Paris\" makes the comparison more specific to literal street-level navigation. This addition narrows the focus, potentially making the philosopher's asserted knowledge seem more about rote memorization of routes rather than a broader familiarity with the city, subtly shifting the perception of the analogy's scale and nature.","The French \"des endroits plus brillants\" (more brilliant places/areas), describing the land on the Moon, is translated as \"the brighter part.\" This changes the original plural \"endroits\" (places/areas), suggesting multiple distinct bright regions, to the singular \"part.\" This alteration simplifies the visual description, potentially leading the reader to imagine the Moon's land as a single, undifferentiated bright area rather than a complex of various brighter locations as implied by Fontenelle, subtly shifting the perception of the lunar landscape's composition.","The original French \"comme des taches obscures\" (like obscure spots) uses a simile, suggesting the waters on the Moon appear *like* or *as if they are* obscure spots. The English translation \"obscure Spots\" removes the comparative \"comme\" (like/as). This subtly shifts the description from a resemblance or an impression to a more direct observation or inherent quality, potentially making the observation seem more definitive or less interpretative than Fontenelle's nuanced phrasing implies."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P034: Mais, reprit- elle, je serois bien aise de sçavoir encore plus en détail comment est fait le dedans du Pays.

The English translation \"glorious Approbation\" elevates this by introducing strong connotations of splendor, magnificence, and even divine favor, which are not the primary senses of \"éclatante.\" In the highly charged religious and political atmosphere of 1687 England, where King James II's Catholic leanings and Declaration of Indulgence caused significant Protestant anxiety about a resurgence of Catholic power, this choice of word subtly manipulates the reader's perception. It presents the Papal endorsement in a more majestic and venerable light than a more direct translation like \"striking\" or \"brilliant\" would convey. This shift in tone and connotation could be seen as an attempt to lend greater weight or a more positive framing to Catholic cultural authority during a period when such authority was deeply contested, thereby indirectly influencing the reader's understanding."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sçais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune.

But guess you what sort of thing <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">is</span></span> to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon. They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable.

In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy</span></span> by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly.</span></span> All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon.</span></span> They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Ariosto sets them altogether</span></span>: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long.</span></span> The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable. When we go to some Lands newly discover'd, we find the Inhabitants scarce Men; they are a sort of Animals in humane shape, and sometime imperfect enough, but almost wholly without reason: therefore surely he that should go on to the Moon, would not find them Men at all.</p>","explanations":["The French 'ont prétendu' can mean 'have claimed' or 'have asserted'. The English translation 'have pretended themselves Masters,' especially considering the anti-Catholic sentiment in late 17th-century England during James II's reign, carries a stronger potential connotation of 'feigned' or 'falsely asserted.' This subtly steers the English reader towards a more definitively negative interpretation of Papal claims, aligning with contemporary English Protestant biases, more so than the original French term which allows for a more neutral reading of 'claimed'.","The original French uses a playful rhetorical question, 'Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie.' (But guess what sort of thing one *doesn't* find on the Moon. Folly.), setting up an ironic reveal that all folly is indeed on the Moon. The translation changes this to a direct question, 'But guess you what sort of thing *is to be found* in the Moon. Folly.' This alteration removes the initial layer of witty misdirection and simplifies Fontenelle's sophisticated, playful tone, thereby manipulating the reader's engagement with the text's original stylistic wit.","The omission of the introductory phrase 'En recompense' (In return / As compensation / On the other hand) in the translation disconnects the statement about 'lost Wits' from the preceding discussion of Folly. In the original, this phrase links the two ideas, suggesting a cosmic balance or ironic consequence. Its absence in the English text makes the philosopher's observation more abrupt and less nuanced, subtly altering the flow of Fontenelle's reflection and diminishing the interconnectedness of his musings.","The French 'Je croy que' (I believe that) signifies that the narrator is presenting his personal interpretation or belief regarding Ariosto's depiction. The English translation omits this phrase, rendering the statement as 'Ariosto sets them altogether', a definitive assertion of fact. This shift subtly alters the narrator's voice from speculative and subjective to authoritative and objective, thereby manipulating the reader's perception of the narrator's epistemic stance and the nature of the information being conveyed.","The French construction 'il n'est pas possible que... ne + subjunctive' (here meaning 'it is not possible that... I *won't* make you have...') expresses a strong degree of certainty that the narrator *will indeed* cause the Marquise to have a phial of lost wit on the Moon. The English translation, ''tis not impossible but that... I shall procure you', equates to 'it is possible that I shall procure you'. This significantly weakens the narrator's playful and confident assertion of his intellectual influence over the Marquise, changing the tone from one of certainty to mere possibility, thus altering the perceived dynamic between the characters."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience?

This substitution diminishes the intensity of human self-scrutiny implied by the original (continuous action) to a mere periodic one, subtly altering the perception of this human characteristic.","The French 'On a esté réduit à dire' (One was reduced to saying / People were reduced to saying) implies a widely-held or reluctantly-accepted conclusion about humanity's perplexing nature. The translation 'It made some say' confines this to a few individuals, thereby weakening the statement's universality and critical weight, subtly manipulating the reader's understanding of this societal reflection.","The translation omits the clause 'ny ce qu'ils y font' (nor what they are doing there) from the original French. This omission reduces the scope of ignorance about fellow inhabitants of Earth described in the analogy (the original states ignorance of *who* they are AND *what they do*). This subtly weakens the philosopher's argument about the presumption of speculating on lunar life when such terrestrial unknowns persist."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoistra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connoistra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois serieusement, repliquay-je, qu'on ne sçait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moy, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres-ridicule, qui a un air de vraysemblance qui me surprend, je ne sçay où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'estat où estoit l'Amerique avant qu'elle eust esté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Monstres qui courent sous eux</span></span>, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eust dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas</span></span>? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Ameriquains plus propres à estre traversées? En verité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">vous estes fou.</span></span> Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siecles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mestier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont esté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">en éclatant de rire</span></span>, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune sçavent peut-estre déja faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sçait quelle surprise. Vous estes insuportable, dit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">de me pousser à bout</span></span> avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celuy-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sçay bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien seurs que la Zone Torride, &amp; les Zones Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur, &amp; du temps des Romains la Carte generale de la Terre n'estoit guere plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez-bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens. Le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous, on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu nostre habitation, il nous sera permis <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">de connoistre celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune.</span></span> Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader.

If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it. Ah! says the Marchioness, you now give me some comfort; your fallacious reasoning made me sick. I am now in a better condition to go to bed and sleep quietly, if you think fit that we retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P033: Oh! says she I reckon the Inhabitants of the Terra Australis as known; for 'tis certain they must needs resemble us very much, and in fine, we may know them when ever we take the pains to go see them, there they are and cannot avoid us; but the people of the Moon, we shall never know, 'tis that I despair of. If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Monsters that ran upon the Sea</span></span>, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">and that they alone should not know it?</span></span> 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">you are a Fool.</span></span> Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">ready to laugh</span></span>, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">to conclude me</span></span> with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order.

The translation 'Monsters that ran upon the Sea' incorrectly changes the location and nature of these 'monsters,' altering the reader's visual understanding of the described scene of European arrival.","The French 'qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas' emphasizes that the Indigenous Americans did not even know Europe *existed*. The translation 'and that they alone should not know it?' shifts the meaning to suggest the Americans might wonder why they were uniquely ignorant of a connection, subtly changing the portrayal of their unawareness from a lack of conception to a lack of specific information others might possess.","The French 'en éclatant de rire' means 'bursting out laughing,' indicating a spontaneous, overt action. The translation 'ready to laugh' significantly softens this, changing an actualized behavior into a mere potential, thereby altering the philosopher's expressed emotion and the tonal dynamics of the conversation.","The original French 'de connoistre celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune' (to know that of our Neighbors, the People of the Moon) explicitly identifies the 'Neighbors' as lunar inhabitants. The translation 'to make acquaintance with our Neighbours' omits the crucial clarifying phrase 'les Gens de la Lune,' making the statement more general and weakening the specific speculative point about future contact with Moon dwellers.","The French 'mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves' states that truth persuades 'even without needing to appear with all its proofs,' emphasizing its intrinsic, intuitive power. The translation 'and that even not without producing all its proofs' reverses this meaning, incorrectly suggesting that truth *requires* all its proofs to be presented to be persuasive. This is a fundamental alteration of a key philosophical point about the nature and accessibility of truth.","The French 'm'incommodoit, & me faisoit mal' (inconvenienced/bothered me, and pained/hurt me) describes a state of discomfort and emotional or mental distress. The translation 'made me sick' is a significant intensification, suggesting a stronger, almost physical revulsion. This changes the perceived intensity of the Marquise's reaction to the philosopher's arguments.","The French 'vous estes fou' translates to 'you are mad' or 'crazy,' which fits the context of the philosopher's outlandish speculations and the playful tone. The English translation 'you are a Fool' is more directly pejorative, implying a lack of intelligence rather than merely wild imagination. This shift in connotation makes the Marquise's retort harsher, potentially altering the reader's perception of her character.","The French 'de me pousser à bout' means 'to push me to the limit' or 'to exasperate me.' The translation 'to conclude me' is an unusual phrasing that shifts the meaning from the Marquise's emotional state of exasperation to the idea of the philosopher attempting to definitively defeat her in argument or silence her. This subtly alters the focus of her complaint from her feeling overwhelmed to being argumentatively cornered."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P034: THE Third Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P034: THE Third Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P039: La Marquise voulut mégager pendant le jour à poursuivre <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">nos Entretiens</span></span>, mais je luy representay que nous ne devions confier nos chimeres qu'à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles, puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet.

This substitution subtly alters the original meaning by reframing the primary purpose of the philosopher's and Marquise's interactions from serious intellectual dialogue and scientific exploration to amusement or diversion. While Fontenelle's dialogues are stylistically engaging, the term 'Entertainments' risks downplaying the significant philosophical and scientific content being discussed. This shift could have been intended to make the work appear less academically rigorous or potentially controversial to an English audience in the late 17th century, possibly to broaden its appeal or soften the impact of its then-novel scientific ideas."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences estoit habitée, pourroit bien ne l'être point; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril. Je ne soufriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'huy ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espece que l'on croit, &amp; en reserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse estre admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paye point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint Denis ressemble à Paris. Le Soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost un Païs, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mesmes changemens sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voila le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'éleve point de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que nostre Terre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur.</span></span> Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement ou il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoy, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-estre que de grandes cavitez. De la distance ou nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, repliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la verité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantost une partie, tantost une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes. Mais ces mesmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mesmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour estre imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mesmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-mesme, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme nostre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de nostre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied-là, il faudra que la matiere étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voila ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance. Cela nous fournira des fruits, des bleds, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons.

The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud</span></span>. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not.

The English translation renders this as 'It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves...'. Here, 'it' refers to the Moon (the 'body infinitely more hard and solid'). This incorrectly attributes the property of having easily disengaging subtle parts to the Moon. This alteration manipulates the reader's understanding by confusing the scientific comparison Fontenelle is drawing, as it contradicts the preceding assertion that the Moon is too solid to produce vapors in the same way Earth does."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P041: C'est-à-dire, me dit la Marquise, que vous sçavez seulement que tout est bien, sans sçavoir comment il est; c'est beaucoup d'ignorance sur bien peu de science, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">mais il faut s'en consoler</span></span>; je suis encore trop heureuse que vous ayez rendu à la Lune ses Habitans.

The translation 'we must be content' shifts this to a more passive acceptance or satisfaction, subtly altering the Marquise's philosophical stance from active coping with limited knowledge to a simpler state of contentment.","The French \"un Air qui l'envelope en son particulier\" describes an atmosphere that specifically envelops the Moon and is particular to it. The translation \"her Air to cover her\" simplifies this by omitting the nuance conveyed by \"en son particulier\" (meaning 'specifically for her' or 'unique to her'). This omission results in losing the emphasis on the Moon's atmosphere being a distinct and individual characteristic, thereby reducing some of the scientific precision of the original statement.","The French \"il me sembleroit desormais\" (it would seem to me from now on / henceforth) includes the temporal marker \"desormais\", indicating a shift in the Marquise's perspective as a result of the discussion. The English translation \"I should think\" effectively omits the temporal evolution implied by \"desormais\", thereby losing the sense that this is a newly acquired viewpoint. This subtly diminishes the depicted dynamism of the character's evolving understanding in response to the scientific popularization."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empescher la communication des deux Planetes.

This subtly diminishes the optimistic speculation about future human flight capabilities present in the original.","The original French uses the strong metaphor \"a pour prison\" (has for a prison) to describe the inescapable dependency on one's native atmosphere. The translation \"is confin'd to\" significantly weakens this metaphor, reducing the sense of absolute, harsh limitation to a more neutral restriction, thereby altering the tone and impact of the statement.","The original \"qui seroit arrivé\" (who would have arrived) describes a hypothetical state of arrival. The translation \"should...venture upon\" introduces an element of active, risky undertaking (\"venture\") on the part of the Moon inhabitant, which is not present in the French. This subtly shifts the characterization of the hypothetical event from a mere presence to a daring act.","The translation changes \"tomber mort sur la Terre\" (fall dead on the Earth) to \"tumble down dead before us.\" \"Tumble down\" is a more vivid and potentially more dramatic verb than \"tomber\" (fall).

This subtly manipulates the reader's understanding by making Fontenelle's observation seem more itemized and definitively structured than the original general phrasing suggests.","The original \"pour nostre consolation\" (for our consolation/comfort) implies that speculating about the Moon serves as a comfort for the inability to physically visit it. The translation \"for our satisfaction\" shifts the motivation to the fulfillment of curiosity or intellectual desire. This alters the emotional tone, diminishing the original's gentle acknowledgment of human limitations and replacing it with a more straightforward pursuit of understanding.","The French \"prendre autant de celle qui leur est naturelle\" (literally \"to take/acquire as much of that which is natural to them,\" or possibly \"to lose as much of...\") is ambiguous in the context of light rays being tinted. The translation \"losing some of their own [color]\" resolves this ambiguity by offering a scientifically plausible outcome, but in doing so, it significantly rephrases and simplifies the original. This interpretive choice manipulates the reader by imposing a definite meaning where the original may have been less clear or intended a different nuance.","The French \"paroist toute rougeâtre\" (appears quite reddish/all reddish) conveys both a tendency towards red (\"rougeâtre\" - reddish) and an intensity (\"toute\" - quite/all). The translation \"appears red\" simplifies this by removing the \"-ish\" quality denoting approximation and the intensifier. This makes the perceived color seem more definitive and less nuanced than in the original, subtly altering the descriptive precision.","The entire French sentence, 'Il n'appartiendroit qu'à la matiere celeste de nous apporter la lumiere & les couleurs dans toute leur pureté, & telles qu'elles sont.', is omitted in the translation. This omission occurs just before the English text provided as the target segment ('So that the Air of the Moon...'). This act of omission removes a significant philosophical reflection by Fontenelle on the nature of true perception and the idea that unaltered reality (light and colors) could only be perceived directly from 'celestial matter', thus shifting the reader's understanding by withholding this concept."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer nostre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">l'assortiment des couleurs celestes</span></span> y soit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">aussi beau</span></span> qu'il l'est icy.

This addition subtly intensifies her aesthetic preference without direct warrant from the source.","The French \"vous assortiriez un habit\" (you would match/coordinate an outfit) refers to the skill of creating a harmonious combination.

The translation \"a mixture of Colours\" is more generic and can imply a less deliberate or less artful combination, subtly diminishing the idea of Nature's refined artistry as envisioned by the philosopher.","The French \"qu'il sera bien entendu\" implies a guarantee that Nature's color scheme will be intrinsically well-conceived, harmonious, or fitting. The translation \"it shall be well approved.\" shifts the meaning towards external validation or social acceptance, rather than focusing on the inherent quality of the design itself.

The translation \"and yet the variety is still pleasing.\" introduces \"yet,\" which implies a contrast or concession (e.g., 'despite variety which could be otherwise, it is pleasing').

The translation shifts this to the present tense \"sees\" (\"Celadon sees it only\"). This change alters the narrative structure by aligning Celadon's literary example with the philosopher's contemporaneous one, rather than with Alexander's historical one, potentially manipulating the reader's understanding of the sequence and nature of the examples.","The original French \"d'Astrée\" (of Astrée), as part of the phrase \"le sejour d'Astrée\" (the abode of Astrée), is translated as \"of his Astrea.\" The addition of the possessive pronoun \"his\" personalizes Celadon's viewpoint in a way not present in the original. This subtly intensifies the subjective and perhaps idealized nature of Celadon's perception, shifting it from a general reference to a specific, personal connection.","The French \"Un Philosophe la voit comme...\" (A Philosopher sees it as...) is translated as \"a Philosopher sees it only as...\". The addition of the restrictive adverb \"only\" is not justified by the original French for the philosopher's case (unlike for Celadon, where \"ne...que\" translates to \"only\"). This insertion narrows and intensifies the philosopher's perspective, making it appear more limited or exclusive than Fontenelle originally portrayed, thereby manipulating the reader's interpretation.","The French phrase \"qu'il fait icy d'imagination à imagination\" means \"than it (the spectacle) does/changes *here* from imagination to imagination.\" The English translation \"than between Imagination and Imagination\" omits the adverb \"icy\" (here). This omission removes the specific contextual grounding of the comparison—that the variance from imagination to imagination occurs \"here\" (i.e., on Earth, in their current context). This makes the statement more abstract and universal, subtly shifting the meaning by removing its explicit local anchor."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de Spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, repliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mesmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

This apparent transcription error or corruption makes the specific location being discussed unintelligible, fundamentally altering the meaning by obscuring crucial information from the reader.","The original French uses the conditional \"aurois\" (would have), expressing a hypothetical lack of strong regret: \"Je n'aurois pas grand regret\" (I would not have great regret). The English translation \"I am not much concern'd\" changes this to a present indicative, stating a current lack of concern. This is a subtle shift in modality and emotional tone, making the Marquise sound more definitively unbothered rather than simply stating a hypothetical future lack of regret.","The original French \"trouvez-vous qu'on soit tant à plaindre?\" translates to \"do you find that one is so much to be pitied?\". The English translation \"What reason do you find then of Complaint?\" shifts the focus from eliciting pity for the Moon's inhabitants to questioning grounds for complaint about their state. This changes the emotional framing of the question, making the Marquise sound more challenging and less focused on the idea of pity.","The original French \"sur la teste\" (on the head) is general. The English translation \"over a mans head\" introduces a gender-specific term (\"man's\") that is not present in the source. While potentially used generically, this addition subtly makes the experience less universally applicable and shifts perception by adding information not in the original, potentially contrasting with Fontenelle's intention to include women in scientific discourse.","The French \"car ce ne sont point des Vallées qui soient entre des Montagnes\" means \"for they are not valleys that are between mountains.\" The translation \"for they are not mountains?\" incorrectly changes \"Vallées\" (valleys) to \"mountains\" and turns a declarative statement into a question. This significantly alters the geographical feature being discussed and introduces an interrogative tone where the original provides a factual-sounding distinction.","The French \"j'y consens de tout mon cœr\" means \"I consent to it (your mocking) with all my heart\" or \"I willingly allow it.\" The English \"I heartily agree you should [laugh]\" is a stronger assertion. It shifts from permitting or allowing the Marquise's skepticism/mockery to actively agreeing that she *should* engage in it. This implies the speaker expects or encourages the mockery rather than just tolerating it, subtly altering the speaker's stance and the dynamic.","The French \"puisque\" (since, because) establishes a direct, somewhat playful, contrarian reasoning: things on the Moon are opposite *because* Earth is a certain way. The English \"though\" introduces a concessive relationship (\"despite the fact that we live on the surface...\"). This alters the logical connection from a statement of inverse reasoning to one of contrasting possibility, subtly changing the philosopher's argumentative style from whimsical inversion to simple contrast."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle.

I find, says she, that you are very very much confirm'd in your opinion within this little while; it is not long since the Moon was made a Desert, and you were not much concern'd at it, and now should any one venture to tell you that all the Planets are not inhabited as the Earth is, I find you would be angry. 'Tis true, said I, at that moment when you surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me about the Inhabitants of the Planets, I should not only have maintain'd them against you, but I believe I should have told you how they are all made. There are moments for believing, and I never believ'd it so much as at that moment. But now in a cooler Judgment, I think it would be very strange that the Earth should be so well inhabited as it is, and the other Planets not at all; for I would not have you think that we see all that inhabits the Earth, there are as many species of Animals invisible as visible. We see down from the Elephant <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">to the Mite and the Cicon</span></span>, there our sight terminates; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">but from the Mite and the Cicon begins an infinite multitude of Animals to which the Mite is an Elephant</span></span>, and which are not discernable to our plain sight. Glasses have discover'd to us many Liquors full of little Animals, which we should never have suspected to have been there; and 'tis not improbable that the Tast and Relish of those Liquors proceeds from the biting or sting of those Animals upon the tongue and palate. Do but mix some things with some of those Liquors, or expose them to the Sun, or let them corrupt, and you shall presently see a new species of little Animals.</p>","explanations":["The translation alters the original French by changing 'apparemment' (apparently, seemingly) to the more assertive ''tis certain,' which shifts the tone from speculative to definite. Furthermore, it introduces the phrase 'as to their Paradice' to describe Earth from the Moon souls' perspective. This addition inserts a specific Christian theological concept (Paradise) not present in Fontenelle's original, which speaks more generally of being transported to 'un autre Monde' (another World). This manipulation subtly infuses a religious framing, potentially to align the text with the English audience's cultural and religious sensibilities or to mitigate the speculative nature of interplanetary soul migration during a period of religious orthodoxy.","The French 'Ciron' (a specific term for a tiny mite, representing the limit of unaided vision) is translated as 'the Mite' (an accurate rendering) but then unjustifiably expanded with 'and the Cicon.' 'Cicon' is not a standard English term for a similar microscopic creature and appears to be an erroneous addition or a misinterpretation. This manipulation alters Fontenelle's precise singular example ('le Ciron') by introducing a dubious or redundant element, potentially confusing the reader's understanding of the scale of nature being discussed.","Following the earlier alteration of 'Ciron' to 'the Mite and the Cicon,' this segment demonstrates further manipulation through inconsistency. While the new microscopic world is said to begin 'from the Mite and the Cicon,' the crucial comparative role of 'l'Elephant' (which in the original refers to 'le Ciron' as the largest creature in this new, smaller scale) is assigned only to 'the Mite' in the translation ('to which the Mite is an Elephant'). This abrupt and unexplained dropping of 'the Cicon' from the analogy breaks the parallelism, confuses the extended metaphor about the chain of being, and diminishes the logical clarity of Fontenelle's scientific popularization."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut.

The English translation \"may be a World inhabited\" replaces this confident assertion with a modal verb expressing mere possibility. This shift subtly weakens the force of Fontenelle's argument for the plurality of worlds, potentially making the challenging idea seem less assertive and more speculative to the English reader of the time.","Fontenelle's use of the imperfect indicative \"il y avoit\" (\"there were\") presents the existence of these worms in the grain of sand as a descriptive element of his example, grounding it in a supposed observation or a state that supports his argument. The translation \"there might be\" introduces a speculative modality (\"might\"), transforming a descriptive assertion into a conjecture. This lessens the factual weight of the illustration Fontenelle uses to argue for life's tenacity and ubiquity, thereby subtly undermining the strength of his overall point.","The original French \"que l'on en vist seulement la moitié\" means \"that one [people] only saw/sees half of them,\" emphasizing the limitation of human perception in grasping the full extent of Nature's creations. The translation \"that half of them should be seen:\" introduces a modal \"should,\" which can subtly shift the meaning from a statement about actual human observation to an implication about the inherent visibility or intended purpose of these creatures (i.e., whether they were meant to be seen). This change in nuance can divert the reader from reflecting on the vastness of the undiscovered natural world (a key Enlightenment theme) towards a more passive notion of whether these animals were 'supposed' to be visible, potentially softening the challenge to anthropocentric views of nature."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P051: Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë, dit la Marquise, mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planetes, &amp; embarrassée de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux</span></span>; car je voy bien que la Nature, selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela?

The translation \"that must needs be among them\" presents this diversity as a passive, inherent quality that simply exists, removing the emphasis on the intellectual effort of constructing or defining this diversity. This subtly shifts the reader's role from an active conceptualizer to a passive acceptor of a given fact.","The French phrase, literally \"One can only perceive by/from a certain universal view,\" emphasizes the active role and limitations of the human perceiver (\"On peut seulement apercevoir\"). The translation shifts agency to \"one certain general view\" which itself \"may give a prospect of,\" framing the understanding not primarily as an act of human perception (even if aided by a \"view\"), but as a potential revealed by an external perspective. This subtly diminishes the emphasis on the active cognitive engagement of the individual in grasping this diversity. The term \"veuë universelle\" (universal view) is also slightly diminished to \"general view.\"","The French \"que la Nature doit avoir mise\" (that Nature must have placed/put) frames the creation of diversity as a strong inference or logical deduction about Nature's past actions. The translation \"that Nature has wrought\" presents it more as a direct, factual, and already completed act of creation. \"Wrought\" also carries a connotation of skilled craftsmanship, potentially adding a layer not explicit in \"mise\" (placed), and the shift from deduction to assertion changes the epistemological tone, making Nature's work seem more definitively known than speculatively inferred.","The French \"il faudroit ... trouver\" (it would be necessary to find / one would have to find) expresses a necessity or an intellectual task that remains to be accomplished to understand diversity fully. The English translation \"we may yet find\" changes this modality from necessity to mere possibility.

This means the narrator reproaches the Marquise *with the very same criticism* that \"certains Peuples\" (certain Peoples) level against \"our\" (European) art. The English translation changes this construction by using an adverbial clause of comparison (\"as those people...\"), which modifies the act of \"reproching\". This shifts the meaning from the narrator directly adopting and using the \"outsider\" critique as the substance of his own, to merely comparing his action or the situation to that of \"those people.\" This subtly weakens the narrator's identification with the non-European perspective and the directness of his challenge to conventional artistic standards by altering the grammatical relationship and thus the logical connection between the narrator's reproach and the cited critique.","The original French \"le Voyage des Mondes\" (literally 'the Voyage of the Worlds' or 'the Journey to/among the Worlds') refers to the characters' conceptual exploration of multiple celestial \"Worlds\" (planets). This is central to Fontenelle's theme of the \"plurality of worlds\" as stated in the book's title. The English translation \"the Voyage we had began about the World\" replaces the plural \"Mondes\" (Worlds) with the singular \"the World.\" This alteration significantly narrows the scope of the imagined journey, potentially misleading the reader to think of a voyage around the Earth or a general discussion about 'the world' in a singular, terrestrial sense, rather than an exploration of multiple distinct celestial bodies. This change mutes the radical and primary subject of Fontenelle's work, which was to popularize the new astronomical ideas including the possibility of life on other planets."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Vous m'affligez</span></span>, dit la Marquise.

The translation 'You vex me' often implies a milder sense of annoyance or irritation, thereby softening the Marquise's expressed emotional response and diminishing the perceived gravity of her concern.","The French 'jolie' (pretty) describes a planet with pleasing aesthetic qualities. The translation 'brisk' (active, energetic, lively) changes this to a quality of dynamism or temperament. This alters the criteria for a planet to be considered the 'Mother of Loves', shifting from visual appeal to a more active characteristic, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the ideal qualities.","The French 'presider aux Amours' (to preside over the Loves) implies a role of authority, direction, or being formally in charge. The translation 'to influence the Loves' suggests a weaker, less direct, and less authoritative role for the Moon, subtly diminishing its perceived power or function in relation to the Venusians' love lives.","The French 'le menu Peuple' refers to the common people or the masses, carrying a clear socio-economic connotation. The translation 'the little people' is ambiguous; it can be interpreted as diminutive (referring to physical size), or as 'common folk' but in a quaint or less precise manner. This choice softens the social distinction and can alter the reader's perception of the Venusian populace, potentially making them sound more whimsical or child-like rather than simply 'common'.","The French 'valent les plus belles de Clesie' means their common conversations 'are worth' or 'are equal to' the most beautiful/refined ones in the novel Clelia. The translation 'is beyond the most polite of Clelia' means 'surpasses'. This is an exaggeration that incorrectly elevates the Venusians' conversational skills beyond what Fontenelle stated, manipulating the reader's perception of their level of refinement.","The French original states that Venus receives 'une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur' (a more vivid/lively light AND more heat), indicating two distinct benefits. The translation 'a Light more lively and hot' grammatically links 'hot' as an adjective directly to 'Light', implying that increased heat is primarily a quality of the light itself, rather than a separate, additional gain. This subtly alters the description of what Venus receives from the sun by conflating two distinct effects."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, interrompit la Marquise, comment sont faits les Habitans de Venus.

The English translation adds the specific qualifier \"of their Temper\". This addition reframes \"coldness\" (and by extension, stupidity) as primarily an innate psychological disposition. This subtly alters the original meaning by downplaying the environmental determinism that is a key theme in Fontenelle's work, where physical conditions of a place (like proximity to the sun, or lack thereof) are suggested to directly influence the characteristics and temperament of its inhabitants. By specifying 'Temper', the translation narrows the cause of this 'coldness' to an internal trait, rather than allowing for the interpretation that it is a consequence of their cold climate, which aligns with Fontenelle's broader argument."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P058: Mais que sera-ce des Habitants de Mercure?

The translation \"fools\" leans more towards an inherent lack of intelligence or sense, subtly shifting the perception of the Mercurians' condition from an environmentally induced state to a potentially innate characteristic, thereby altering the reader's understanding of the cause and nature of their affliction.","The French \"Petites Maisons\" was a general euphemism for insane asylums. The translation to \"Bedlam\" substitutes this with the name of a specific, notorious London institution. This localization makes the concept more concrete and culturally charged for an English audience, potentially sensationalizing Fontenelle's speculation by linking it to a well-known English site of horror, thus manipulating the reader's imaginative engagement with the text.","The French \"tres-foibles Crepuscules\" translates to \"very weak twilights.\" The omission of the intensifier \"très\" (very) in the English translation \"weak twilight\" lessens the extremity of the contrast Fontenelle is describing. This subtly diminishes the imaginative impact of how different light conditions would be on Mercury, potentially making the alien environment seem less dramatically different from Earthly experience.","The French \"apparemment\" (apparently, seemingly) indicates speculation or inference on the part of the philosopher. The translation \"'tis certain\" changes this to a statement of definite fact. This shift in epistemic modality fundamentally alters the nature of the claim, misrepresenting a hypothesis as a certainty and potentially manipulating the reader's understanding of the speculative nature of Fontenelle's scientific popularization.","The French \"Je suis bien fàché\" expresses a strong negative emotion (very sorry, very annoyed, or very upset). The translation \"I am not well pleas'd\" is a significant understatement (litotes) that substantially tones down the philosopher's emotional reaction. This alteration changes the tone, portraying the philosopher as more detached or less impassioned than in the original, which can shift the reader's perception of his character and the seriousness of the described loss."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P059: Je ne suis pas si touchée, dit la Marquise, de cette perte-là que sont les Habitans de Mercure, que de l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de la chaleur.

The English \"the cause is clear\" states the opposite, asserting that the reason *is* understood. This changes the philosopher's stance from admitting a degree of ignorance to claiming certainty, subtly altering the tone of scientific inquiry presented and potentially making the philosopher seem more dogmatic.","The French \"doivent l'estre aussi\" (must/ought to be so too) conveys a strong sense of logical inference or high probability in Fontenelle's analogical argument for life on other planets. The English \"may be so likewise\" reduces this to mere possibility. This softening of the claim subtly weakens the persuasive force of Fontenelle's reasoning as presented to the reader, making his popularization of this bold idea seem more timid.","The French \"de là elle revient à la rencontre de tout ce qui est solide\" describes light *encountering* solid objects as a general phenomenon after emission from the sun. The English translation \"where ever it meets with any thing that is solid, it reflects\" immediately interprets this encounter as *reflection*. This introduces an inferential leap not present in the original phrase, potentially simplifying or slightly misrepresenting Fontenelle's more descriptive account of light's behavior before he explicitly discusses planetary reflection.","The French \"On est bien embarrassé à le dire\" (One is very/quite puzzled/stumped to say it) expresses a significant degree of perplexity and difficulty in defining the Sun's nature. The English \"is hard to say\" is a more subdued and less emphatic expression. This translation tones down the intensity of the confessed intellectual challenge, subtly altering the philosopher's voice and the perceived difficulty of the scientific question.","The French text includes the clause \"& qu'enfin les nouvelles Planetes s'estoient mises à la mode\" (and that finally the new planets had become fashionable) as one of the contributing reasons for the judgment about sunspots. The English translation omits this clause, with the target segment showing the text immediately preceding and following the point of omission. This omission removes Fontenelle's socio-cultural observation on the trendiness of scientific topics influencing the 'Monde Philosophe,' thereby losing a layer of his cultural critique and subtly shifting the reader's perception of the motivations within the scientific community.","The French \"faisoient leur Cour\" (were paying court/currying favor) describes an act of seeking favor that can include flattery but is broader and more nuanced. The English translation \"began their Flattery\" is a more direct and unambiguously negative term, emphasizing sycophancy. This choice intensifies the criticism of the scholars, potentially making their actions seem more crassly subservient than the original French might suggest, thus altering the tone of Fontenelle's social commentary.","The French \"à qui seroit demeuré le maistre des taches pour les nommer comme il eust voulu...\" (to whom would remain the master of the spots to name them as he would have wished) refers to who would have the authority or control to name the sunspots. The English translation \"what Prince should be Godfather to the chief of those Spots\" introduces the specific cultural role of \"Godfather\" and specifies \"the chief of those Spots.\" These additions are not present in the original; they introduce a different cultural framing, add details, and potentially alter the satirical nuance of the competition for naming rights described by Fontenelle."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

The translation to 'Virtuoso's,' while a term for contemporary English natural philosophers (e.g., of the Royal Society), could subtly shift the perception. 'Virtuoso' might emphasize active, perhaps even fashionable, empirical inquiry over the general profound learnedness and intellectual authority implied by 'Sçavans.' This could subtly alter the reader's understanding of the status and nature of the individuals to whom parts of the Moon were named.","Similar to the first instance, translating 'Sçavans' (learned people/scholars) as 'Virtuoso's' subtly alters the connotation. The Marquise states it is 'juste' (just/right) for 'Sçavans' to reserve the Heavens. Using 'Virtuoso's' might frame this claim as stemming more from active investigation and connoisseurship rather than from the deep, established authority of general scholarship that 'Sçavans' more strongly implies, subtly changing the basis of their entitlement.","The French 'd'autres' (others) is a neutral and general term. Translating this as 'any Rivals' introduces a specific notion of competition, contention, and active opposition that is absent in the original. This changes the tone of the Marquise's statement, making her desire for exclusivity for the learned seem more about fending off competitors rather than simply barring generic outsiders.","The French phrase 'quelque chose qui arrive dans les Lunettes' translates to 'something that happens in the telescopes/lenses,' which is a neutral and broad description of an observed phenomenon. The English translation 'some accident in the Telescope' narrows this meaning significantly. 'Accident' implies an unintended mishap, a fault, or a chance, unpredictable event. This subtly undermines the reliability or inherent nature of the telescopic observation, potentially suggesting instrumental error or defect as the cause of the 'pure vision,' rather than a regular optical effect or a true, albeit misinterpreted, solar feature.","The original French 'C'est pourtant dommage' idiomatically means 'It's a pity, however' or 'It's a shame.' The English translation 'which certainly is a great loss' significantly intensifies this sentiment. The addition of 'certainly' and the elevation of 'pity/shame' to 'great loss' makes the expressed regret more emphatic, absolute, and substantial than the more moderate expression in Fontenelle's original text, thereby altering the emotional tone.","The French phrase 'autour de soy' means 'around oneself,' referring to the hypothetical observer ('On') who would be situated on the Sun ('au centre de tout'). From this observer's perspective, planets would appear to revolve around their own central position. The translation 'about him' refers to the Sun (as 'him'). This shifts the perspective from the subjective, phenomenological experience of an inhabitant of the Sun (which Fontenelle is inviting the reader to imagine) to a more standard, external Copernican description of planets revolving around the Sun as an object. This alters the specific imaginative frame Fontenelle constructs.","The French word 'personne' in the phrase 'il n'y a personne' means 'no one' or 'nobody' and is gender-neutral. The English translation 'there's not a man' renders this as gender-specific. Given that Fontenelle's work was groundbreaking for its accessibility and explicit address to a female audience (the Marquise), this translation choice, even if reflecting a common older English usage for 'nobody,' subtly reintroduces a male-centric default for human presence or scientific observation. This contrasts with the original's more inclusive language and could shift the reader's perception in a context where female inclusion in intellectual discourse was a key aspect of the work's novelty."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P063: J'avoüe que je m'estois trompé, répondis-je, je ne songeois qu'à la situation où est le Soleil,&amp; non à l'effet de sa lumiere; mais vous qui me redressez si à propos, vous voulez bien que je vous dise que vous vous estes trompée aussi; les Habitans du Soleil ne le verroient seulement pas.

The translation 'pray make an end of fooling me' changes her tone to one of mild exasperation, as if she believes the philosopher is tricking her, rather than her being swept away by the ideas. This alters her characterization from passionately curious to impatient with perceived deception.","The original 'je ne connois plus de retenuë sur la Philosophie' means 'I no longer recognize any restraint regarding Philosophy,' indicating the Marquise is abandoning all inhibitions in her pursuit of philosophical knowledge. The translation 'nor muse longer upon Philosophy' inverts this, suggesting she will *stop* contemplating philosophy. This manipulates the reader's understanding of her engagement with the subject from enthusiastic immersion to disengagement.","The French idiom 'laissons parler le monde' means 'let people talk' or 'let's not care what society says,' alluding to potential social disapproval of a Marquise deeply engaging in philosophy. The translation 'let us leave talking of the World' changes this to mean 'let's stop discussing the topic of the world/universe.' This omits the social commentary and the Marquise's defiance of societal norms, particularly relevant given the cultural context of women's access to science, thereby altering the perception of her character and motivations.","The original French, 'c'est dommage qu'ils [ses emportemens] n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet,' translates to 'it's a pity that they [her passions/enthusiasms] only have Vortices as their object.' This is a subtly patronizing or flirtatious remark from the philosopher. The translation ''tis pity there is any other Objects than Vortices' reverses the meaning entirely, suggesting it's a shame to be interested in anything *but* Vortices. This erases the original nuance and the philosopher's complex attitude, manipulating the portrayal of their interaction.","The French 'se meuvent toutes en un mesme sens' clearly means that the parts 'all move in the same direction.' The translation 'move all in conformity to themselves' is vague and scientifically inaccurate for Descartes' theory. It implies individual particles moving according to their own nature rather than a unified, collective directional flow, thus subtly altering the reader's understanding of the physical concept of a vortex."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P065: Voila quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme le Maistre; mais en mesme temps les Planetes se composent de petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de celuy du Soleil.

The English 'she was plac'd' suggests an external agent or deliberate action, subtly introducing a teleological nuance of design not explicit in Fontenelle's more mechanistic explanation.","The French 'à nostre bienséance' (to our suitability/convenience) is a practical term. The English 'at our devotion' introduces a stronger hierarchical and emotional element of loyalty or subservience from the Moon, altering the original's more neutral and functional description of the relationship.","The French 'qu'on doit avoir' uses the impersonal, inclusive pronoun 'on' (one/people in general).

In the context of the early Enlightenment and the described religious tensions in England, where Fontenelle's work subtly promoted naturalistic explanations, this addition of \"design'd\" could manipulate the reader by reinforcing a more traditional, teleological (and potentially theistic) interpretation of cosmic phenomena. This might have served to make the text more palatable or less challenging to prevailing religious orthodoxies that emphasized a creator's direct involvement, subtly altering Fontenelle's more neutral phrasing.","The French \"ces malheureux Pays\" (these unfortunate/wretched lands/regions) describes the geographical locations enduring prolonged nights. The translation shifts this to \"the unhappy people of that Country.\" While the inhabitants' unhappiness is logically implied by the conditions of such lands, the original text focuses on the characteristic of the \"Pays\" (land/region) itself. This alteration personalizes the suffering by explicitly naming \"unhappy people\" instead of \"unfortunate lands,\" thereby shifting the emphasis from the harsh environmental condition of the place to the explicit emotional state of its inhabitants, potentially to evoke a more direct and sentimental empathetic response from the reader.","The French \"jolis Spectacles\" (pretty/lovely/charming spectacles) evokes a sense of charm, visual delight, and aesthetic beauty, characteristic of Fontenelle's literary style aimed at making science appealing and engaging. The translation \"pleasant Spectacle\" is more subdued, general, and less vivid. This change in diction tones down the original's enthusiastic and picturesque quality, subtly altering the tone and potentially diminishing the reader's perception of Fontenelle's effort to blend scientific popularization with literary charm and wonder.","The translation omits the descriptive phrase \"ce jeu perpetuel\" (this perpetual game/play) from Fontenelle's original expression \"ce jeu perpetuel d'Eclipses qu'elles font.\" The original French casts the frequent eclipses on Jupiter in a light, dynamic, and almost playful manner, enhancing the charm of the scientific popularization. By reducing this to the more straightforward \"their Eclipses,\" the translation removes this layer of imaginative and whimsical description. This omission makes the depiction more factual and less vivid, altering the tone and shifting the reader's perception of how Fontenelle engages with scientific wonders, thereby losing some of the original's literary artistry."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P070: Et vous ne manquerez pas, dit la Marquise, à faire habiter ces quatre Lunes, quoy que ce ne foient que de petites Planetes subalternes, destinées seulement à en éclairer une autre pendant ces nuits?

Instead, she is made to speculate on complex political and colonial relationships, suggesting the moon inhabitants should be 'Colonies,' receive 'Laws and Customs,' and render 'Homage.' This substantial alteration of her speech introduces socio-political themes of hierarchy and subservience absent from Fontenelle's original text at this point, thereby shifting the Marquise's character and the conversation's focus, potentially to resonate with contemporary English political concerns and manipulating the reader's perception of the work's original intent.","This specific idea, of Jupiter being a 'monstrous Planet' constantly 'suspended over their heads,' is originally part of the Marquise's articulated wish in the French text. In the English translation, this component of her wish is detached from her initial (altered) speech. After her dialogue is changed to discuss colonial themes and a lengthy, unoriginal speech by the philosopher is inserted by the translator, this phrase reappears. However, it is now presented as an objective statement or a consequence seemingly derived from the philosopher's preceding inserted reasoning, rather than as the Marquise's own imaginative desire. This shift in attribution and narrative context manipulates the reader's understanding of the dialogue's flow and the origin of the idea.","In the original French, the Marquise's reflection comparing the fear of Jupiter falling to the Gauls' fear of the sky falling is a direct continuation of her own speech. In the English translation, this segment is presented immediately after a lengthy, fabricated speech by the philosopher and the re-contextualized (formerly Marquise's) idea of Jupiter hanging overhead. Critically, this part of her original speech lacks explicit re-attribution to her at this point in the English text (e.g., via 'says she,' which is used for her subsequent lines). This makes the statement appear as a continuation of the preceding unattributed narrative or the philosopher's extended argument, thereby obscuring the Marquise's clear authorship of this point in the original and subtly altering the dialogic structure and her contribution to the conversation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit-elle, aprés que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">impunément</span></span> de la crainte des Eclipses, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The translation interprets and specifies this cost as \"without paying for it by some folly.\" This addition of \"folly\" as the explicit price is an interpretive layer not directly present in the word \"impunément,\" thereby narrowing the original meaning and guiding the reader's understanding of the consequence.","The French phrase \"mais comme je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner\" translates to \"but as I do not pride myself on being able to guess it\" or \"but as I don't claim to be able to guess it,\" expressing a polite modesty or disclaimer of ability. The English translation \"but-how, I trouble not my head to guess.\" significantly alters this tone. The phrase \"I trouble not my head to guess\" suggests active disinterest or a refusal to make an effort, rather than humility. The added interjection \"but-how\" also contributes to a more abrupt and colloquial tone, changing the Marquise's character from gracefully modest to somewhat curt or dismissive.","The French \"qui m'occupe\" (which occupies me/my thoughts, or which has been on my mind) describes a state of being thoughtfully engaged with a difficulty. The English translation \"has possess'd me\" dramatically intensifies this state, suggesting an overwhelming, almost involuntary preoccupation. This changes the connotation from intellectual concern to a more extreme emotional or mental state, subtly altering the portrayal of the Marquise's engagement with the problem."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P073: De bonne foy, je croy que cela est, répondis-je.

Concurrently, \"toutes les peines que se donnent\" (all the efforts/pains they take) is translated and expanded to \"the pains and studies\"; the addition of \"and studies\" specifies intellectual labor, whereas \"peines\" is broader, thus subtly shifting the emphasis of the scientific endeavor.","The French \"Les Curieux vont la voir\" (The curious go to see it) is translated with heightened intensity as \"the curious run to gaze on it.\" The addition of \"run\" implies an urgency and eagerness not present in \"vont\" (go), and \"gaze\" suggests a more intense, perhaps prolonged, act of looking than the general \"voir\" (see).

The English 'planted toward us', while it can mean positioned, often carries additional connotations of being fixed, firmly established, or even strategically placed (akin to planting artillery or a flag). This subtly alters the image of the telescopes, potentially making them seem more static, imposing, or deliberately set with a specific intent than the more general 'dressées' implies, thus shifting the reader's perception of the imagined scene.","The original French 'comme les nostres le sont vers luy' literally means 'as ours are [directed/aimed] towards him,' simply indicating the orientation or state of Earth's telescopes relative to Jupiter. The translation 'as ours are to behold him' adds an explicit statement of purpose ('to behold him') which is only implied in the original French. Furthermore, the choice of the verb 'behold' is more literary and carries a sense of formal observation, wonder, or awe, adding a connotative layer and a degree of elaboration not present in the straightforward French phrasing. This addition of explicit purpose and shift in lexical choice subtly alters the original's conciseness and tone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P075: Cela ne va pas si viste que vous pensez, repliquay-je.

This points to a potential for complex social dynamics, such as fragmentation or lack of inter-societal awareness among different groups of Jovians. The English translation changes 'des autres Peuples' (of the other Peoples) to 'of it,' making the object of ignorance the planet Jupiter itself ('that World'). This alteration shifts the meaning from a lack of knowledge about *other societies* on Jupiter to a lack of *geographical knowledge* of their own planet. This subtly removes the social dimension of Fontenelle's speculation, focusing instead on the physical scale and explorability of the planet, thereby manipulating the reader's perception by downplaying potential social commentary for a more straightforward scientific observation.","The French original states that Jovian philosophers might have been prosecuted for wanting to 'soûtenir que nous estions' (maintain that we existed/were). This is a general existential claim. The English translation renders this as 'for holding that we have a Being in Nature.' The addition of 'in Nature' specifies and frames the controversial belief within the discourse of Natural Philosophy, a term and field of study highly prominent in England during the late 17th century. While 'arraigning' is a suitable translation for 'fait le procés à,' the qualification 'in Nature' subtly alters the original's broader, simpler statement about existence. It recasts the Jovian philosophers' 'heresy' into terms more familiar to contemporary English intellectual debates, potentially narrowing Fontenelle's original, more open-ended philosophical point and aligning it more closely with a specific scientific-philosophical framework then current in England, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the nature of the persecuted belief."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P076: Quoy, dit la Marquise, vous comptez cela pour <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">une grace</span></span>?

Translating it as \"a kindness\" makes the concept more general and less impactful. This subtly alters the tone and diminishes the perceived magnanimity or special quality of Nature's supposed act as initially questioned by the Marquise and posited by the philosopher.","The French verb \"montre\" (shows) casts Nature as an active agent in selectively presenting information. The translation \"has let us see\" shifts Nature to a more passive role, merely permitting humans to see rather than actively revealing. This alteration subtly changes the reader's understanding of Nature's agency and its relationship with human observers in the popularization of scientific ideas.","The French \"une assez grande faveur\" translates to \"a rather/sufficiently great favour,\" implying a significant, measured gift, often from a superior entity like the personified Nature. The English \"a great kindness\" loses the nuance of \"assez\" (rather/sufficiently) and substitutes \"faveur\" (favour, a specific boon) with the more general and less formal \"kindness.\" This subtly alters the tone, diminishing the original's emphasis on Nature bestowing a specific, considerable benefit and potentially downplaying the sense of a hierarchical relationship.","The French \"nous faisons si bien que nous attrapons\" (we do so well/are so clever that we catch/discover them) highlights human ingenuity and success, possibly with an ironic undertone characteristic of Fontenelle's popularizing style. The translation \"have taken a course to find out\" omits the emphatic \"si bien\" (so well/so cleverly). This omission neutralizes the original's characterization of human effort, downplaying the cleverness or remarkable nature of the discoveries and presenting them as a more mundane, procedural undertaking. This shifts the perception of human agency and achievement in the context of scientific advancement."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P077: Je voy, reprit-elle, par ce nombre de seize Planetes qu'il faut que Saturne ait cinq Lunes.

The translation simplifies this to merely \"astonish'd,\" omitting the introspective element. This subtly alters her characterization, portraying her as less thoughtful and more purely reactive, which can shift the reader's perception of her intellectual engagement.","The French \"quelques Estres vivans\" (some living beings) is translated as \"every living Being.\" This significantly broadens the scope of Nature's providence from specific instances to a universal scale. This shift implies a more perfect, all-encompassing, and perhaps divinely ordained natural order, potentially aligning with more traditional theological views and subtly altering Fontenelle's more nuanced and speculative approach to scientific popularization.","The French \"apparemment\" (apparently, seemingly), which modifies \"comptent\" (consider/esteem), is omitted in the translation of the phrase \"comptent apparemment pour de plus grands bienfaits\" (apparently consider it a greater benefit) as \"esteem a much greater benefit\". This omission changes the statement from a supposition by the philosopher to a more factual assertion about how inhabitants of Venus and Mercury view their nights. This removes speculative nuance characteristic of Fontenelle's style, presenting the idea with a greater degree of certainty.","The French \"ressources\" (resources, means) is a neutral term for how Martians might cope with moonless nights. The translation \"refuge\" (a place of shelter from danger or trouble) carries a connotation of peril or adversity. This subtly alters the tone, suggesting Martian nights are harsher or more dangerous than the original implies, shifting the reader's perception of conditions on Mars.","The French \"s'en imbibent, & s'en penetrent\" describes two absorption processes: materials \"soak up\" light and \"are permeated by it.\" The translation \"imbibe it, and diffusing it\" keeps the first idea but changes the second process of thorough absorption (\"s'en penetrent\") to an emission process (\"diffusing it\"). This alters the scientific description of phosphorescence, misrepresenting one part of the described phenomenon by replacing a detail about absorption with the subsequent act of emission.","The French \"rêpandre un nouveau jour\" (to spread a new day/light) is translated to \"create a new day.\" The verb \"create\" is significantly stronger than \"rêpandre\" (to spread), implying a fundamental act of bringing daylight into existence rather than merely distributing light. This subtly exaggerates the capability of the hypothetical luminous birds, making the idea sound more miraculous or fantastical than the original's more grounded speculation.","The French \"un Spectacle assez agreable\" (a quite/rather pleasant spectacle) expresses a moderate level of appreciation. The translation \"a delightful spectacle\" uses a much stronger adjective, significantly intensifying the expressed emotion. This makes the philosopher's hypothetical scenario sound more wondrous or amazing than the more reserved original, subtly altering the tone of the speculation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oyseaux.

The translation \"agrees very well\" significantly lessens this degree of precision. This subtly diminishes the asserted strength or accuracy of the scientific \"Sistêmes\" (Systems) being discussed, potentially making them seem less rigorously defined or certain than Fontenelle suggested.","The French \"bien étonnez\" translates to \"very astonished\" or \"greatly astonished.\" The English translation \"sufficiently astonished\" moderates the intensity of this emotion. This toning down subtly reduces the sense of awe and wonder that Fontenelle aims to evoke regarding the cosmos, making the described experience less impactful.","The original \"feroit l'effet de\" means \"would have the effect of\" or \"would act as,\" describing an observed phenomenon. The translation \"performs the office of\" introduces a teleological nuance, implying a designated role or function. This phrasing could subtly shift the reader's perception towards a universe operating by appointed roles rather than purely naturalistic effects, a nuance potentially aligning with contemporary English theological leanings which emphasized order and design.","The French uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" (\"one cannot dispense with...\"), presenting the idea of populating moons as a general, logical consideration. The translation \"I think we cannot...\" personalizes this, attributing it directly to the philosopher's opinion. This shift subtly changes the nature of the assertion from a general speculative necessity to a personal conjecture, potentially altering the perceived objectivity of the argument.","The French \"Que de Mondes!\" is an exclamation meaning \"So many worlds!\" or \"What a lot of worlds!\", expressing a large but indefinite quantity. The translation \"what an infinity of Worlds\" introduces the specific and philosophically potent concept of \"infinity.\" This significantly amplifies the claim, making Fontenelle's speculation seem more radical or definitive on this point than the original's more general exclamation, aligning it more forcefully with the controversial Enlightenment idea of an infinite universe.","In the French, \"bien foible\" (very weak) modifies both \"éclat\" (gleam/brightness) and \"chaleur\" (heat), meaning \"only a very weak gleam and a very weak heat.\" The translation offers \"a little glittering and a feeble heat.\" While \"feeble\" captures \"foible\" for heat, \"a little glittering\" for the light does not fully convey the intensity of \"bien foible\" (very weak) for \"éclat.\" This subtly alters the description, making Saturn's sun seem to provide light that is comparatively less weak than its heat, shifting the balance of privation described by Fontenelle.","The French \"suër à grosses gouttes\" means \"to sweat profusely\" or \"to sweat in big drops,\" a strong but physiologically recognizable human-like reaction. The translation \"melt\" substitutes this with a far more extreme, fantastical, and less biologically plausible image. This sensationalizes the description, potentially making the imagined inhabitants of Saturn seem less like varied forms of life and more like purely imaginary beings, which could alter the reader's engagement with Fontenelle's popularization of extraterrestrial life."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P081: Ainsi, reprit-elle, on est bien sage dans Saturne, car vous m'avez dit que tout le monde estoit fou dans Mercure.

The translation changes this to 'as a Buffoon or a Jack-pudding.' These terms are significantly stronger and more pejorative. 'Buffoon' implies ridicule, and 'Jack-pudding' introduces a specific, culturally-bound English archetype of a low-comedy stage clown, which has no direct equivalent in the original's more general description. This shift intensifies the Saturnians' perceived judgment of Cato, altering it from an observation about behavior (excessive playfulness) to a contemptuous categorization of his person as a professional fool. This change manipulates the reader's understanding by altering the tone of the philosopher's remark, making the Saturnians seem more harshly judgmental and introducing a culturally specific, less refined comedic element than in Fontenelle's original, more subtly witty French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P083: Du moins, reprit la Marquise, une commodité fort réelle qu'a nostre Monde par sa situation, c'est qu'il n'est ny si chaud que celuy de Mercure ou de Venus, ny si froid que celuy de Jupiter ou de Saturne.

The translation changes this in two ways: 1. It omits \"veux\" (want to), altering her statement from an expression of intent (\"I want to give thanks\") to a direct declaration of action (\"I give thanks\"), making her tone more assertive and immediate than in the original. 2. It changes \"d'estre sur\" (for being on) to \"for placing me in.\" This attributes a more active, deliberate role to \"Nature\" in her specific location. This subtly shifts the focus from gratitude for a circumstance to gratitude for an act of placement, potentially reinforcing a more providential worldview for the English reader. This is significant as Fontenelle's work was moving towards a view of the universe less dependent on continuous divine intervention.","The French \"vous luy rendrez grace\" (you will/would give her thanks), spoken by the philosopher, functions as a strong suggestion or a polite imperative regarding what the Marquise should be thankful for. The translation \"you may give her thanks\" replaces this with a modal of permission or possibility. This significantly softens the philosopher's assertion, changing his tone from confidently directive to merely suggestive. This alteration lessens the force of his argument about the value of personal attributes (youth, beauty, nationality) as sources of gratitude and subtly reframes his intellectual posture relative to the Marquise, potentially to make his (French) character seem less authoritative to an English audience or to conform to different stylistic norms.","The original French \"Voila bien d'autres sujets de reconnoissance que ceux que vous tirez de...\" means \"Here are indeed other subjects of gratitude/thankfulness than those that you draw from...\". The translation \"these are things to be acknowledg'd as advantages as well as those you receive by...\" introduces two key manipulations: 1. \"Sujets de reconnoissance\" (subjects of gratitude/thankfulness) is rendered as \"things to be acknowledg'd as advantages.\" This shifts the connotation from an emotional or moral appreciation inherent in \"reconnoissance\" towards a more pragmatic, utilitarian recognition of \"advantages,\" subtly altering the philosophical and sentimental tone of the philosopher's remark. 2. The French comparative structure using \"que\" (than) suggests a contrast, implying these personal attributes are different, perhaps more significant, reasons for gratitude. The English \"as well as\" changes this to an additive structure, presenting the philosopher's points merely as additional items to the Marquise's list, rather than contrasting or re-prioritizing them. This weakens the gentle corrective nuance in his statement, making him sound like he is simply adding to her list rather than offering more compelling alternatives."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P084: Mon Dieu! repliqua-t-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">laissez-moy avoir de la reconnaissance sur tout</span></span>, jusque sur le Tourbillon où je suis placée.

The translation 'let me acknowledge all' shifts the meaning from an emotional expression of thankfulness to a more neutral, cognitive act of admission, thereby altering the Marquise's tone to be less warm and appreciative.","The French 'si on vous proposoit' uses the impersonal pronoun 'on' (one/they), referring to a general hypothetical offer of 'lively pleasures'. The translation 'if I propose' changes this to a specific, personal action by the philosopher ('I'). This alteration subtly makes the philosopher the potential source of these pleasures, changing the dynamic of the conversation and potentially his perceived role.","The French 'que vous vous borneriez à nous?' asks if the Marquise would 'limit herself to' or 'be content with' the philosopher and his intellectual offerings, implying a choice of personal satisfaction. The translation 'and will be of our side.' fundamentally changes this meaning to a question of allegiance or taking a partisan stance. This introduces a confrontational or factional connotation not present in the original, manipulating the reader's understanding of the Marquise's commitment."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: CINQUIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P078: THE Fifth Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P078: THE Fifth Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P086:.

This translation choice, by specifying \"men,\" subtly narrows the general and inclusive scope of Fontenelle's \"on.\" This results in altering the perception of who is engaging (or not engaging) in such scientific considerations, potentially undermining the original's inclusive tone which was a key feature of Fontenelle's popularization of science.","The original French \"Il seroit impossible\" (It would be impossible) presents a strong, near-certain logical deduction as part of the philosopher's argument about why fixed stars must be self-luminous.

Concurrently, 'tout-à-fait dans l'enfoncement' (describing something as entirely in the deep background or very far off) is rendered as 'wholly drown'd.' This changes the imagery from optical distance and indistinctness to a more dramatic and potentially negative metaphor of being submerged or overwhelmed, thereby intensifying the Marquise's expression of difficulty or dismay beyond the likely original intent.","The original French, 'Je pretends bien que ma paresse profite de mes nouvelles lumieres' (I fully intend for my laziness to profit from my new insights), portrays the Marquise actively and wittily claiming her new knowledge as a justification for her laziness. The translation, 'These new Lights I intend shall apologize for me,' shifts the agency. Instead of her 'laziness profiting,' the 'new Lights' (knowledge) are posited as the agent that 'shall apologize.' This alters the Marquise's playful self-justification into a more passive construction where her knowledge makes excuses for her, subtly diminishing her active wit and changing the character of her reflection.","The phrase 'c'eust esté faire trop mal sa Cour que de luy en parler' (literally, it would have been to pay one's court too badly to speak to him of it) refers to the act of currying favor with a superior and implies that speaking of such worlds to Alexander would have been a serious political miscalculation, potentially angering him. The translation 'it had been an ill Complement to have told him of them' significantly softens this meaning. An 'ill complement' suggests a social gaffe or an awkward remark, downplaying the original's implication of a politically imprudent and potentially perilous action when dealing with a powerful monarch. This alters the perceived astuteness regarding court politics.","The original French 'Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau' translates to 'A little weakness for what is beautiful,' where 'foiblesse' (weakness) can be a gentle or charming flaw. The translation 'a little foolish inclination for the thing that's fair' introduces the word 'foolish,' which is an addition not present in the source text. This interpolation adds a pejorative connotation, making the philosopher's self-described trait seem silly or irrational rather than a possibly refined sensibility. This subtly manipulates the reader's perception of the philosopher's character.","The French 'une belle bouche' (a beautiful mouth) is translated as 'that pretty Mouth.' In the context of compliments and aesthetics, 'belle' (beautiful) typically conveys a higher degree of admiration, depth, and aesthetic seriousness than the English 'pretty' (which aligns more closely with the French 'jolie'). This substitution subtly lessens the intensity and perceived value of the compliment paid by the philosopher, potentially diminishing the Marquise's praised attribute or the earnestness of the admiration expressed."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle en riant; il se sauve de tout, &amp; il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal.

The English translation uses \"him\" to refer to the star. As \"star\" is a neuter noun in English (standard pronoun \"it\"), the choice of \"him\" introduces a masculine personification. This alters the original's gendering, which, even if primarily grammatical in French, becomes a specific personification choice in English, subtly shifting the perception of the celestial body.","The French original poses a direct question: \"Is this of an absolute necessity?\". The translation changes this to a negative question: \"Is not this of absolute necessity?\". This alteration shifts the tone of the Marquise's inquiry. A negative question often carries an underlying assumption or expectation (e.g., that it is *not* an absolute necessity, aligning with her expressed skepticism), making her challenge appear more pointed or her opinion more pre-formed, rather than a more neutral seeking of clarification.","The French phrase \"à la fin cela va loin\" translates to \"in the end, that goes far\" or \"it leads to significant consequences.\" The English translation \"and so to the Worlds end\" dramatically amplifies this. \"To the Worlds end\" is a much stronger and more expansive expression, suggesting an almost boundless extent. This exaggeration intensifies the philosopher's analogy, altering the original's more measured tone.","The French \"il faut franchir le pas de bonne grace\" means \"one must take the step / make the advance with good grace\" or \"willingly.\" The translation \"you must e'en go on\" (you must indeed/even go on) conveys the necessity of continuing but omits the crucial element of \"de bonne grace\" (with good grace, willingly). This omission changes the philosopher's counsel, making the progression of the argument seem more like an unavoidable, perhaps even reluctantly accepted, continuation for the Marquise, rather than a step she is encouraged to take willingly and gracefully. This subtly shifts the reader's perception of the persuasive dynamic."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P091: Cela est hors de doute, répondis-je.

The translation \"The people there seat him\" introduces specific, sentient agents (\"The people there\") and a more active, almost ceremonial verb (\"seat him\"). This shifts the meaning from a general astronomical perception or categorization to a deliberate action performed by imagined inhabitants of other worlds, subtly adding a layer of anthropomorphism and explicit agency not as foregrounded by the more abstract French.","The French \"on n'y songe seulement pas\" means \"one doesn't even think/consider them,\" emphasizing a lack of basic cognitive awareness due to their invisibility. The translation \"and no body dreams of them\" alters the verb \"songer\" (which more commonly means to think/consider in this context) to the more poetic \"dreams,\" and omits the crucial emphatic adverb \"seulement\" (even). This changes the tone from a factual observation about perception to a more whimsical or imaginative one, and loses the original's stress on how completely these planets are overlooked, thereby subtly shifting the reader's understanding of their insignificance.","The Marquise's question in French, \"Ne faut-il pas ... que ... different\" (Isn't it necessary that... / Don't... have to differ), conveys a strong sense of logical deduction and conviction. The English translation \"may not these Worlds differ\" significantly softens this assertion into a mere possibility. This lessens the perceived intellectual force and confidence of the Marquise's statement, potentially affecting the portrayal of a woman engaging in scientific reasoning, a key aspect of Fontenelle's work.","The French \"car un fond de ressemblance ne laisse de porter des differences infinies?\" (for a basis of resemblance nevertheless bears/produces infinite differences?) is phrased as a rhetorical question supporting the previous one, implying an affirmative answer. The translation \"for a Resemblance in the main may admit of infinite varieties.\" changes this into a declarative statement and uses \"may admit of,\" which suggests possibility rather than the more certain process implied by \"ne laisse de porter\" (does not fail to bear/produce). This dual shift (from question to statement, and from certainty to possibility) further weakens the logical force and assertive tone of the Marquise's argument as presented in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est de deviner.

The English translation 'ther's no such thing' suggests a more fundamental or categorical difference – not just an absence of these planets, but that the very concept or type of 'subordinate planets' doesn't exist or isn't applicable in that other vortex. This subtly manipulates the reader's understanding by potentially exaggerating the nature of diversity between cosmic systems, making the differences seem more absolute than a simple numerical absence, which could make Fontenelle's universe appear even more radically varied than intended.","The French 'mesme' (even) in 'Je ne doute pas mesme que' (I do not doubt even that) serves as an intensifier, signaling that the following idea (deserted vortices) is a more daring or further-reaching speculation. The translation 'I doubt not likewise but' replaces 'even' with 'likewise'. 'Likewise' means 'also' or 'in the same way', which fails to convey the escalation in speculative boldness. This omission of emphasis subtly alters the tone, making this particular speculation seem like just another item in a list of possibilities rather than a more extreme conjecture. This can manipulate the reader's perception by understating the audacity of Fontenelle's thought within the cultural context of emerging Enlightenment ideas challenging older cosmologies.","The French 'Enfin, que voudriez-vous?' translates to 'In short/Finally, what would you want/wish?' or 'What would you have (it be)?'. This is an open-ended rhetorical question, perhaps inviting the Marquise (and the reader) to ponder the possibilities or engage her own imagination. The English translation 'In fine, what more would you have?' introduces the word 'more'. This addition subtly shifts the tone and meaning, implying that a sufficient number of speculative examples have already been provided by the philosopher. The question becomes less of an open invitation for thought and more of a query about the completeness of the speaker's list (e.g., 'What else could be added?' or 'Isn't this enough?').

The English translation shifts to the inclusive personal pronoun \"we\" and the simple present tense \"usually reckon\". This alteration changes the temporal setting of the comparison. Instead of contrasting a new discovery with a definitively past, superseded understanding (\"one used to count\"), the translation suggests a contrast with a current or general habit of estimation (\"we usually reckon\").

The translation 'Grainery of Worlds' (granary of worlds) changes the metaphor to a storehouse for harvested grain. This shifts the imagery from dynamic generation and potential inherent in 'seed' to a more static concept of storage or collection, subtly altering the philosophical nuance about the universe's creativity and abundance.","The French 'apparemment' (apparently, seemingly, probably) expresses a degree of speculation or hypothesis. The translation to 'evidently' (clearly, obviously) presents the statement with a much higher degree of certainty. This change makes Fontenelle's philosophical speculation about the 'little Worlds' seem like an established fact, altering the original's cautious and popularizing tone into a more assertive or dogmatic one.","The original French 'un Soleil' (a Sun / one Sun) is part of a declarative statement describing a general rule. The English translation introduces a question mark after 'Sun' ('one Sun?'), which inserts an interrogative or doubtful tone not present in the source. This subtly undermines the certainty of the scientific principle being explained, potentially reflecting translator caution or a desire to make the assertion seem less definitive to the reader.","While 'Ciel' can translate to 'sky' or 'heaven,' in Fontenelle's astronomical context aiming to popularize a rational view of the universe, 'sky' is the more neutral and scientific term. The choice of 'Heaven' for 'vostre Ciel' (your sky) in 17th-century England, a period of significant religious discourse and tension, could subtly imbue Fontenelle's scientific description with religious connotations. This might reframe the scientific observation within a more traditional, theological lexicon, potentially altering the secularizing tone of the original.","The French 'Estres disgraciez de la Nature' means 'beings out of favor with Nature' or 'unfavored/disadvantaged by Nature,' suggesting misfortune or a less advantageous position. The translation 'Beings curs'd by Nature' is a significant intensification. 'Cursed' implies a malediction or a severe, almost punitive, condemnation. This shift dramatizes the perceived condition and introduces a stronger, more judgmental, and potentially fatalistic tone than Fontenelle's more philosophical and observational phrasing."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P096: Je ne vous demande pas, dit la Marquise, s'il y a des Lunes dans les Mondes de la Voye de Lait; je voy bien qu'elles n'y seroient de nul usage aux Planetes principales qui n'ont point de nuit, &amp; qui d'ailleurs marchent dans des espaces trop étroits pour s'embarrasser de cet attirail de Planetes subalternes.

The translation 'I have a great kindness for' significantly tones down this enthusiasm, making the Marquise sound more detached, formal, or even slightly patronizing. This alters the character's vivacity and her engagement with the scientific ideas, which is a key element of Fontenelle's popularization aiming to make science appealing.","The French 'Balons' (balloons, air-filled balls, or spheres) evokes a lighter, perhaps more abstract or even whimsical imagery appropriate for Fontenelle's elegant popularization of cosmology.

The English translation \"incroach upon\" introduces a negative connotation of transgression or trespassing, as \"to encroach\" means to advance beyond proper limits or to infringe upon another's domain. This subtly alters the perception of the \"foreign planets\" (Planetes étrangeres), making their entry into \"our\" vortex sound like an intrusion rather than a purely mechanical consequence. This change in connotation could resonate with contemporary English anxieties about foreign influences or encroachments on established order during the socio-political climate of the late 1680s, thus manipulating the reader's understanding of the comets' nature and actions as described by Fontenelle."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P101: J'entends, dit-elle..

In the original French, this sentence draws an analogy: 'We also have this in common with the Ottomans, I replied, that they receive Ambassadors without sending any back, & that we do not send any of our Planets to neighboring Worlds.' This omission removes a characteristic element of Fontenelle's style, where scientific concepts are connected to contemporary social or political observations (here, Ottoman diplomatic practices). By deleting the philosopher's witty reflection, the translation curtails his contribution to the dialogue, simplifies the comparison with the 'Grand Seigneur,' and deprives the reader of a nuanced layer of meaning. This manipulates the reader's understanding by presenting an incomplete and less intellectually playful version of the original exchange, potentially to avoid any sensitivities around comparisons involving the Ottoman Empire in the English socio-political context of the late 17th century or simply to abridge the text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P102: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">A en juger par toutes ces choses-là</span></span>, repliqua-t-elle,, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">nous sommes bien fiers</span></span>.

The translation to \"To speak my Opinion ... upon the whole matter\" (extracted from the fuller clause \"To speak my Opinion, said she, upon the whole matter,\") reframes her statement as a more general or spontaneous expression of personal opinion rather than a deduction. This shift subtly alters the perception of the Marquise's reasoning process, potentially downplaying the logical or rational basis of her reflections, which contrasts with Fontenelle's aim of popularizing reasoned inquiry and scientific thought during the early Enlightenment.","The French \"nous sommes bien fiers\" (we are very proud/arrogant) reflects a critique of human hubris or excessive self-esteem regarding humanity's cosmic significance, a relevant theme in a work popularizing Copernicanism which challenges anthropocentric views. The translation to \"we are very rude\" changes this critique to one of social impoliteness or ill-mannered behavior. This significantly alters the philosophical weight of the Marquise's statement, diverting it from a reflection on human self-importance in the universe to a more mundane comment on social conduct, thereby manipulating the reader's grasp of the text's engagement with key Enlightenment themes.","The French phrase \"ne seroient pas si propres à se faire craindre\" uses the conditional tense ('seraient' - would not be), suggesting a hypothetical or potential quality of 'our' planets—that they would prove less apt or suitable to inspire fear if they were to travel to other worlds. The English translation \"are not so proper to cause Fear\" uses the present indicative ('are not'), stating this lack of fear-inducing quality as a current, inherent characteristic of 'our' planets. While the subsequent clause \"should they be sent into other Worlds\" introduces conditionality for the travel, the property itself is presented as a more definitive, fixed attribute in English. This grammatical shift subtly manipulates the reader's understanding by making 'our' planets seem intrinsically less threatening, rather than conditionally or potentially so, thus altering the nuance of the comparison being made."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P103: Les queües &amp; les barbes, répondis-je, ne sont que de pures apparences..

This lessens the intensity of the described human reaction to comets, manipulating the reader's perception of the emotional weight of the statement by understating the distress.","The omission of 'bien' (very) from 'bien malheureuse' (very unhappy) reduces the expressed degree of the comet's suffering. This understates the philosopher's vivid portrayal of the comet's misfortune, manipulating the reader's perception by softening the empathetic tone of the comparison and thus the impact of the philosophical point being made.","The French 'ennuyeuse' (boring, tedious) is translated as 'uneasie enough' (sufficiently uncomfortable, anxious).

Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoistre, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons-nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mesmes? Vous estes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en vostre faveur. Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantost plus grandes, tantost plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus legers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur, il y a des Etoiles fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroistre &amp; disparoistre, &amp; enfin disparoissent entierement, des demi Soleils reparoîtroient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoistroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoistre de longtemps. Prenez vostre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'estre visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en luy-mesme une source de lumiere? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, répondis-je, nostre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des broüillards, ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces taches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toujours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée belle, dit-on. Le Soleil a esté tres-pasle pendant des années entieres, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'estoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire, la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa; mais si elle eust continué, nous estions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je sçay les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pasle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris-je: Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changemens: soit lents, soit prompts, mais toujours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Les Anciens estoient plaisans de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais,</span></span> parce qu'ils ne les avoyent pas encore vû changer.

Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se laissoient des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoyent suivre, n'y auroient rien changé.

Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroistroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir nostre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque-autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses mêmes qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attens bien que s'il disparoist des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroist de nouvelles, il faut que l'espece se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir esté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démeslez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je croy aisément que tout cela peut estre, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir esté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir esté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différens, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondemens d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naistre &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'estes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage.

How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</p> <p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</p> <p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature. Has not she the secret of causing Herbs and Plants to spring and dye in a continual Revolution? I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it.</p> <p>P111: In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that I have e'en left them.</p> <p>P112: Let us leave them more yet, said I, if you'l be persuaded by me, and talk no more of them; for you are now come to the highest Roof of Heaven, and to tell you whether there be Stars beyond that or not, will require more knowledge than I have. Place Worlds there, or place them not, 'twill depend upon your self. The Empire of Philosophers is properly in those great invisible Country's, which may be or not be, according as they please, and be such as they please to make them.

Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">That Idea, said he, is too sad,</span></span> can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable.

This omission removes a vivid and dire consequence of a sun extinguishing, thereby softening the catastrophic imagery and potentially reducing the reader's perception of the severity of such an event.","The French \"funeste\" (meaning fatal, dire, disastrous) is translated as \"sad.\" This significantly weakens the intensity of the Marquise's reaction, changing her expression of profound dread to mere sadness, thus altering the tone and downplaying the perceived gravity of the concept being discussed.","The French phrase \"estoient plaisans de s'imaginer\" (were amusing/ridiculous to imagine) carries a gently mocking or critical tone towards the Ancients' naivety. Translating this as \"had a pleasant fancy\" neutralizes the critique, making the Ancients' belief seem merely quaint rather than scientifically misguided. This softens Fontenelle's challenge to outdated authority, a key aspect of early Enlightenment thought.","The original French \"de memoire de Rose\" (in the memory of a Rose) is a poetic and whimsical phrase that powerfully emphasizes the extremely limited lifespan and perspective of the roses in the analogy. The translation \"our History tells us of no other\" is more formal and prosaic. This change loses the specific charm and the poignant connotation of an individual, fleeting memory, replacing it with a suggestion of collective, recorded knowledge, thereby altering the tone and imaginative quality of Fontenelle's argument.","The French phrase \"que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë\" indicates that the Marquise has completely changed her mind, overcome her previous misconceptions, or achieved a new understanding regarding the heavens. The translation \"that I have e'en left them\" incorrectly suggests she has simply abandoned or dismissed the topic. This fundamentally alters the portrayal of her intellectual development and the conclusion of her learning journey in the dialogue."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Quoi, s'écria-t-elle</span></span>, j'ay dans la teste tout le systeme de l'Univers! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Je suis sçavante!</span></span> Oüy, repliquay-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">vous l'estes assez raisonnablement</span></span>, &amp; vous l'estes avec la commodité de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">dés que l'envie vous en prendra</span></span>.

The translation \"So, says she\" is significantly more subdued and purely narrative, drastically reducing the intensity of the Marquise's reaction. This manipulation flattens her character's expressiveness and lessens the dramatic impact of her intellectual awakening.","The French \"Je suis sçavante!\" is an emphatic, exclaimed assertion (indicated by the exclamation mark) of achieving a significant intellectual status. \"Sçavante\" implies a high degree of learnedness or erudition, a notable claim for a woman in that historical period. The English translation \"I am now a knowing Woman.\" (ending with a period instead of an exclamation mark) presents this as a much calmer, more matter-of-fact statement. This change in tone, coupled with the potentially less weighty connotation of \"knowing\" compared to \"sçavante,\" downplays the significance and emotional force of the Marquise's declaration of her newfound scientific understanding.","The French phrase \"vous l'estes assez raisonnablement\" means \"you are it [sçavante/learned] to a quite reasonable/sensible degree,\" which positively affirms the extent and quality of her learning. The English translation \"reasonable enough,\" particularly in the construction \"You are, said I, reasonable enough,\" can carry a connotation of being merely adequate, passable, or meeting a minimum standard, rather than being impressively or thoroughly learned. This subtly alters the philosopher's affirmation, potentially making it sound more qualified, slightly condescending, or less enthusiastic about her achievement.","The French \"dés que l'envie vous en prendra\" translates to \"as soon as the whim/fancy/desire (for it) takes you.\" This phrasing emphasizes that the Marquise is free to reject the learned material based on a sudden, capricious feeling, highlighting the non-dogmatic and perhaps even gallant or light-hearted way the knowledge is offered. The English translation \"till you please your self\" (which can mean \"until it pleases you\" or \"for as long as it pleases you\") suggests a more sustained state of choice or a condition lasting for a period determined by her general inclination, rather than being triggered by an immediate, specific whim. This shifts the nuance of the intellectual freedom offered, making it seem less about an immediate, capricious dismissal and more about a general, ongoing permission to disbelieve or a deferred decision."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">FIN</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P115: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P115: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">FINIS.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French original uses \"FIN,\" the simple vernacular term for \"THE END.\" The translation uses \"FINIS.\", a Latin term. While \"FINIS.\" was a common convention for concluding books in English during that period, its use instead of the direct English equivalent \"THE END\" introduces a layer of classical formality. This subtly shifts the tone from the straightforward accessibility implied by Fontenelle's use of \"FIN\" in a work explicitly aimed at popularization and written in the vernacular (French), potentially making the English version's conclusion seem slightly more learned or aligned with traditional scholarly works than the original's simple closing."]}],"counts":{"manual":12,"ai":341}}
