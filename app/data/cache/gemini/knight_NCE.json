Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description</span></span>, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune estoit levée il y avoit Page 8] peut-estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moyndre Etoile; elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">une Beauté brune</span></span> qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">aux Brunes,</span></span> vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée. Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">Helas,</span></span> repliquay-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">qui me réjoüit,</span></span> &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Et bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la-moy, je croiray sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, repliquay-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self. Well, says she, since your Folly is so delightful, pray let me have a share in it, I'l believe what you please of the Stars, provided I find pleasure in it. Ah! Madam, said I, 'tis not a pleasure like that which you find in a Comedy of Moliere; 'tis a pleasure, I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind. And pray, says she, do you think me incapable of pleasures that are only in the Reason; bring me acquainted with your Stars, and you shall presently see the contrary. No, said I, it shall never be laid to my charge, that in a Grove, at ten of clock at night, I entertain'd the most lovely person in the World with nothing but Philosophy, look out for such Philosophers elsewhere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">I find I am falling into a Description</span></span>, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it.

This omission adapts the French authorial voice, which often included such direct interpellations, by removing a specifically French form of address. This makes the text's presentation conform more to common English narrative practices of the period, thereby eliminating a foreign socio-literary marker.","The French phrase \"une Beauté brune\" (a dark-haired beauty, or beauty associated with dark/brown hues) is translated as \"a black beauty.\" While \"black\" in 17th-century English could denote dark hair or complexion, \"black beauty\" is an intensified and poetically charged term compared to the relatively standard French \"Beauté brune.\" This choice aligns the description with English literary conventions that often employed a starker \"fair\" versus \"black/dark\" dichotomy, thus domesticating the concept by fitting it into a familiar target-culture aesthetic framework.","The French noun phrase \"aux Brunes,\" (to the dark-haired/complexioned women) is translated as \"to the black,\". This choice, similar to translating \"Beauté brune\" as \"black beauty,\" employs a term (\"the black\") that, particularly in contrast to \"fair,\" resonates with established English literary tropes. It domesticates by translating the French category of person into an English conceptual category carrying specific cultural and literary connotations familiar to the target audience of the time.","The French interjection \"Helas,\" (Alas!), an expression of lament or regret, is translated as \"Faith,\". \"Faith\" (often \"i'faith\") was a common English interjection in the 17th century, typically expressing assertion, surprise, or functioning as a mild oath, rather than sorrow. This substitution domesticates the exclamation by replacing a widely understood expression of regret with a period-specific English colloquialism that alters the emotional tone to one more idiomatic in English speech of that era, aligning with target culture conversational norms.","The French clause \"qui me réjoüit,\" (which delights me/makes me rejoice) is translated as \"that tickles,\". While \"réjouir\" expresses pleasure, the English verb \"tickles\" introduces a more colloquial, playful, and physical sensation. This choice domesticates by replacing a general term for joy with a vivid English idiom that makes the philosopher's intellectual pleasure more concrete and familiarly amusing to the target audience, adapting the concept to align with target culture metaphorical norms."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne sçavois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle qui ne sçavoit rien en matiere de Phisique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit estre une Planete; &amp; les Planetes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des Mondes. J'en revenois toûjours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en nostre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes; &amp; si d'un autre costé vous étiez moins curieuse, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le sçavoir</span></span>, ce qui reviendrait au mesme. Mais on veut sçavoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est-là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera. Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">s'inquiete</span></span> d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien, qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers; car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">tous ces Gens</span></span> dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyoient le Vol de Phaëton <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">que les Vents enlevent</span></span>, qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre</span></span>; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"5\">laisser le haut du Theatre vuide</span></span>; &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"6\">cent autres resveries</span></span>, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique? Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"7\">On veut que</span></span> l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties.

When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\">you would not care two pence</span></span> to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret.

Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">beat his brains</span></span> about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">all that learned crew</span></span>, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">born upon the Wings of the Wind</span></span>, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre</span></span>, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"5\">a vacuity in the top of the Theatre</span></span>, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"6\">a thousand other extravagancies</span></span>, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"7\">Some will have it, that</span></span> the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"8\">We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads</span></span> a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</p>","explanations":["The French \"vous ne vous soucieriez pas\" expresses general indifference ('you would not care/bother'). The English translation substitutes this with the colloquial idiom \"not care two pence,\" which is specific to English currency and expression. This makes the philosopher's speech more vernacular and familiar to an English audience, adapting the expression to align with target culture norms.","The French `s'inquiète` (from `qui s'inquiete d'un Vol`), meaning 'is concerned/puzzles over', is rendered by the vivid English idiom \"beat his brains\" (from `who would beat his brains about a Turn`). This substitution employs a colloquialism rooted in English, making the description of the machinist's efforts more intense and familiar to the target audience than the more neutral French original.","The French \"tous ces Gens\" (all these people) is a neutral and general term. The English \"all that learned crew\" uses \"crew,\" which, while capable of describing a group, introduces a more informal and vivid English colloquialism. This choice subtly alters the tone by using a more specific and characterful English noun phrase than the original's general term, making it more aligned with English vernacular.","The French \"que les Vents enlevent\" (from `le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent`), meaning 'that/which the Winds lift up', is a direct description. The English translation \"born upon the Wings of the Wind\" (from `the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind`) employs a well-known, more poetic, and established literary phrase in English. This substitution domesticates the original's plainer phrasing by elevating the style in accordance with English literary conventions.","The French uses \"amitié\" (friendship), an anthropomorphic and somewhat whimsical term, to describe Phaeton's supposed attraction to the top of the theatre. The English translation replaces this with \"natural Propensity,\" a more formal, pseudo-scientific term common in English philosophical and early scientific discourse of the period. This adaptation aligns the ancient philosopher's flawed explanation with conceptual language more familiar or deemed more appropriate within the target culture's intellectual traditions, reducing the foreignness of the original's personification.","The French \"laisser le haut du Theatre vuide\" (leave the top of the theatre empty) uses the common word \"vuide\" (empty). The English translation uses \"a vacuity in the top of the Theatre.\" \"Vacuity\" is a more Latinate, formal, and less common term than \"empty space.\" This lexical choice elevates the register, aligning the description of the ancient philosopher's flawed reasoning with a more learned or formal English style, potentially conforming to target culture expectations for philosophical discourse.","The French \"cent autres resveries\" (a hundred other reveries/fantasies) is translated as \"a thousand other extravagancies.\" The number is hyperbolically increased from \"a hundred\" to \"a thousand,\" a common practice in English for emphasis. Furthermore, \"resveries\" (fantasies/daydreams) is replaced by \"extravagancies,\" a stronger term implying greater irrationality or absurdity. This dual shift intensifies the criticism using English rhetorical conventions and word choice.","The French \"On veut que\" (from `On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand`), an impersonal construction meaning 'The idea/theory is that' or 'It is proposed that', is translated as \"Some will have it, that\" (from `Some will have it, that the Universe is in great`). This English phrasing attributes the idea to a specific, though unnamed, group ('some people'). This personification makes the philosophical proposition more concrete and aligns with a common English rhetorical style of presenting ideas as viewpoints held by particular parties.","The French \"Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la teste\" (Many people always have in their head) is a general observational statement. The English \"We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads\" transforms this into a more direct, experiential framing ('We... daily meet'). This makes the observation more immediate and relatable by framing it as a common, shared experience for the speaker and English reader, a pragmatic adaptation to engage the target audience more directly."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

The English translation uses \"with it\" in \"Heaven which wheels them along with it\", rendering the motion as a more neutral, mechanical process. This change reduces the original's metaphorical or potential theological nuance, aligning the text with a more secularized or 'rational' scientific discourse, potentially seen as more appropriate for the English target audience of the early Enlightenment and avoiding sensitive religious connotations during a period of religious tension in Britain.","The French source uses \"Le Chariot\", the common French name for the asterism known in English as the Big Dipper or The Plough (part of Ursa Major). The English translation substitutes this with \"The Waign\", an archaic English term for the same asterism (related to \"Charles's Wain\"). This is a clear instance of domestication, replacing a source-culture-specific astronomical term with its then-current target-culture equivalent to ensure familiarity and accessibility for English readers.","The French \"l'Astronomie est fille de l'Oisiveté\" (Astronomy is daughter of Idleness) employs a direct and vivid personification. The English translation \"Astronomy derives it self from Idleness\" rephrases this as a more abstract and analytical statement. This domestication softens the overt allegorical style of the original, adapting the metaphor to what might have been considered a more sober or formal register for popular scientific writing in English at the time, thus aligning with target culture literary norms.","Similar to the previous instance, the direct personification in the French \"la Geometrie est fille de l'Interest\" (Geometry is daughter of Interest) is rendered more abstractly in English as \"Geometry from Interest\" (with \"derives it self\" implied from the preceding clause: \"Astronomy derives it self from Idleness, and Geometry from Interest\"). This continued shift away from direct personification domesticates Fontenelle's literary flair, making the expression more conventional and less poetically intense for the English readership of the period.","The French \"qu'elle est fille de l'Amour\" (that she [Poetry] is daughter of Love) continues the pattern of direct personification. The English translation \"it draws its Original from Love\" opts for a more formal and detached expression. This change domesticates the original's metaphorical vivacity by transforming it into a more conventional, analytical statement about origins, aligning with perceived target culture preferences for a less overtly figurative style in such discussions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien-aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie. La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus interessée que je ne l'ay, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne, &amp; nous y menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraye vie pastorale que de parler des Planetes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaist, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">fort peu devot</span></span>, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">La pensée est trop libertine</span></span>, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter</span></span>. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis</span></span>, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">une espece d'enchere</span></span>, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"5\">Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire</span></span>; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"6\">Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde</span></span> avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"7\">l'épargne dans l'execution</span></span>. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoyent esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pieces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvemens qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">something irreligious</span></span>, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">'Twas the expression of a Libertine</span></span>; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">it was no longer to be doubted</span></span>. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice</span></span>; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference.

'Irreligious' is a stronger term than 'peu devot' and may have been chosen to make the King's character more clearly problematic to an English audience in the 1680s, where 'irreligion' was a significant concern amidst heightened religious tensions, thereby aligning the characterization with potent target culture anxieties.","The French 'La pensée est trop libertine' (The thought is too libertine) is rendered as ''Twas the expression of a Libertine'. This shifts the focus from the abstract quality of the thought to categorizing the speaker as 'a Libertine', a term with strong negative moral and social connotations in 17th-century England. This personification makes the condemnation more direct and aligns with potential target culture tendencies to judge controversial statements by labeling the individual.","The French 'on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter' (one was careful not to want to doubt it/one wouldn't dream of doubting it), which implies a conscious social or intellectual pressure, is translated as 'it was no longer to be doubted'. This English phrasing presents the unquestioning acceptance of Aristotle's ideas as a more absolute, dogmatic, and externally imposed state, simplifying the psychological nuance. This might align with Enlightenment-era critiques of scholasticism prevalent in the target culture, making past intellectual subservience seem more starkly unreasonable.","The French 'mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis' (would make him unable to give advice/put him out of condition to advise) is translated with the common English idiom 'save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice'. This domestication replaces a more abstract French expression with a familiar, pragmatic English idiom, slightly shifting the nuance from intellectual inability to the convenience of not needing to expend effort, making the text more accessible and natural-sounding to the target audience.","The French 'une espece d'enchere' (a kind of auction) is translated as 'a kind of Chaffering'. 'Enchère' refers to a more formal auction process, while 'chaffering' (haggling, bargaining) denotes a more informal, everyday marketplace interaction. The translator opts for a term likely more colloquial and familiar to the English reader, thus adapting the metaphor to common target culture experience.","The French 'Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire' (She [Nature] is of an extraordinary thrift/saving) is translated as 'she's hugely provident'. While 'provident' includes thrift, it strongly introduces the concept of foresight and, in 17th-century English, often carried connotations of divine wisdom (Providence). This domesticates Fontenelle's purely economic term 'épargne' by aligning Nature's efficiency with a concept rich in English theological and philosophical discourse, potentially making it more palatable.","The French 'Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde' (This thrift/saving nevertheless agrees) is translated as 'yet this Providence agrees well'. The use of 'Providence' (often capitalized in English to refer to divine guidance) for the French 'épargne' (thrift) explicitly domesticates the concept by framing Nature's economy in terms resonant with English religious and philosophical thought, where Divine Providence in nature was a common theme.","The French 'l'épargne dans l'execution' (the thrift/saving in the execution) is translated as 'a sparing Providence in the Execution'. This continues the domestication strategy by consistently replacing the secular/economic term 'épargne' with 'Providence' when describing Nature's workings. This reinforces the interpretation of Nature's efficiency through a lens of wise, almost divine, oversight familiar and significant to the English target culture."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient.

In late 17th-century Protestant England, marked by religious tensions (Catholic/Protestant, Anglican/Dissenter), the casual French use of \"Mon Dieu\" might be perceived as inappropriate or even blasphemous by parts of the English audience. Omitting it domesticates the text by removing a potentially problematic foreign cultural-linguistic habit, making the dialogue more aligned with perceived English religious and social proprieties of the time.","The Marquise's French expression \"Je vous jure\" (I swear to you / I assure you strongly) is translated as \"I profess.\" In the socio-religious context of 17th-century England, where explicit \"swearing\" could be controversial (e.g., for Quakers and Puritans who objected to oaths), \"I profess\" offers a strong affirmation while avoiding the term \"swear.\" This choice domesticates the text by adapting the Marquise's language to better fit English cultural and religious sensibilities, aligning her speech with a more sober or cautious mode of expression deemed suitable for the target audience.","The direct French statement \"Il mourut\" (He died) is rendered as \"Faith he died;\" in the English translation. The addition of the interjection \"Faith\" (a colloquialism common in 17th-century English, short for \"by my faith\") domesticates the text.

The English translation uses \"Bowl\", which in 17th-century England would strongly evoke the game of bowls (lawn bowling), a popular English pastime. This choice domesticates the generic French term by linking the philosopher's analogy to a specific and familiar cultural reference for the English reader, making the scientific explanation more accessible and relatable through a common recreational image. This is an instance of adapting a concept to align with target culture norms and replacing a generic reference with one that has strong target culture connotations.","The French phrase \"on ne l'a guere ménagée,\" spoken by the Marquise, personifies the Earth and uses a colloquial, literary turn of phrase implying it hasn't been \"spared\" or \"treated gently\" in the new Copernican system. This reflects Fontenelle's characteristic blend of science with witty, charming French salon conversation. The English translation \"She is not easily movable\" rephrases this as a more objective, factual statement about Earth's physical properties. This act of domestication transforms the original's nuanced, personified complaint into a more straightforward observation, adapting the concept and tone to potentially align with different English cultural or stylistic expectations for female discourse on scientific topics or a preference for plainer prose, thereby reducing the distinctiveness of the source's literary and conversational style."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P010: Oh! repliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative.

This substitution domesticates the original by replacing a French-origin metaphor (even if \"pirouette\" is a loanword in English, its connotations might be more specific or less universally familiar than common toys/objects) with imagery drawn from everyday items well-known in English culture. This makes the Marquise's playful or apprehensive description of the Earth's spin more immediately vivid and relatable to the target audience by grounding it in common, tangible experiences, thus adapting the concept to align with target culture norms of metaphorical comparison."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P013: En verité, dit-elle, tout cela meriteroit bien <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">que l'on donnast vingt-quatre heures de son temps à le voir</span></span>.

This is a form of domestication as it recasts the original French phrasing into a common English idiomatic structure, prioritizing fluency in the target language.

While 'Hole' conveys darkness and confinement, it also carries stronger connotations of being primitive, undignified, or squalid, particularly for a dwelling. This choice transforms the more neutral French description of the 'Grand Prestre's' (Great Priest's) abode into something that could align with 17th-century English Protestant perceptions of non-Christian religious figures or practices as 'heathenish' or uncivilized. By rendering the 'obscure place' as 'a Hole,' the translator makes the foreign element more concretely and perhaps contemptuously imaginable, fitting it into a target-culture framework that might view such practices with disdain or a sense of superiority.","The French 'debiterons peut-estre encore des resveries' (we will perhaps again be uttering/spouting ... reveries/fancies/musings) is translated as 'possibly shall yet find other extravagant Inventions.' This represents a significant conceptual shift. 'Resveries' in Fontenelle's usage often carries a light, playful, self-deprecating tone, referring to imaginative or speculative thoughts. The translation changes the act from 'uttering/spouting' (débiter) pre-existing or whimsical thoughts to actively 'finding Inventions.' 'Inventions' suggests concrete novel ideas, discoveries, or creations, aligning better with the proactive spirit of the Scientific Revolution and the high value placed on ingenuity and discovery in late 17th-century England. This adaptation makes the protagonists' intellectual discussions sound more purposeful and productive according to target culture norms, domesticating the original's more nuanced and characteristically French literary style."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P015: Il est assez plaisant, dit la Marquise, d'imaginer ce que vous venez de me dire; mais si je voyois tout cela d'en haut, je voudrais avoir la liberté de hâter ou d'arrêter le mouvement de la Terre, selon que les objets me plairoient plus ou moins, &amp; je vous assure que je ferais passer bien viste ceux qui s'embarrassent de Politique, ou qui mangent leurs Ennemis; mais il y en a d'autres pour qui j'aurois de la curiosité.

The English translation \"this Country\" would be naturally understood by a late 17th-century English readership as referring to England. This substitution domesticates the original by re-localizing the Marquise's social commentary, making it appear as a direct observation about English society rather than French or broader European society, thereby aligning the text more closely with the target audience's cultural context.","The French phrase \"cela s'appelle baailler\" means \"that's called yawning,\" indicating that the Marquise finds the philosopher's moralizing digression boring or tedious. The English translation substitutes this with \"that's call'd Bantring.\" \"Banter\" or \"Bantring\" in late 17th-century England referred to a witty, teasing, or playful mode of conversation. This change significantly alters the Marquise's expressed reaction, replacing an indication of boredom with an accusation of playful or evasive speech, a concept ('Banter') that had particular cultural resonance in English society of the time. This adaptation aligns the Marquise's response with target culture norms of social interaction and wit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: En retournant au Château je luy dis <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes</span></span>, qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Ticho- Brahé qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fust immobile, la plaçoit au centre du Monde, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planetes, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planetes autour de la Terre.

The English translation \"to carry on the business of Systems\" suggests merely continuing with the topic or dealing with it as a matter of course, rather than bringing it to an exhaustive conclusion. This shift alters the perceived scope and formality of the philosopher's discourse, making it sound less like a formal, exhaustive treatment and more like an ongoing, perhaps more accessible or colloquial, engagement. This domestication aligns the presentation of the intellectual endeavor with potentially less formal stylistic norms in English popular writing of the period, reducing the \"foreign\" intellectual weight of the original phrasing.","The French \"riant\" (literally \"smiling\" or \"laughing\") attributes a cheerful, personified quality to Copernicus's system, reflecting a particular French literary and intellectual style of \"esprit\" (wit, vivacity). The English translation \"more delightful,\" while conveying positive sentiment, is a more general and less metaphorically vivid term. This adaptation tones down the specific French imagery, making the description of the scientific system more conventional and perhaps less whimsical for an English audience of the period, thereby aligning a potentially \"foreign\" metaphorical concept with target culture norms for discussing scientific ideas."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: SECOND SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P014: THE Second Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P014: THE Second Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P021: Le lendemain au matin dés que l'on pût entrer dans l'Appartement de la Marquise, j'envoyay sçavoir de ses nouvelles, &amp; luy demander si elle avoit pû dormir en tournant.

The English translation renders this as 'maintain an Intrigue with the very Enemy'. In the late 17th-century English socio-political context—marked by events such as the Popish Plot, the Exclusion Crisis, intense factionalism (Whigs vs. Tories), and the broader anxieties leading to the Glorious Revolution in 1688—the word 'Intrigue' carried strong connotations of secret plotting, scheming, and clandestine political maneuvering. By choosing 'Intrigue' over a more direct rendering of 'ménagements' (e.g., 'careful dealings', 'prudent measures'), the translator adapts Fontenelle's more general concept of cautious interaction. This choice frames the philosopher's analogy in terms of behavior and anxieties specifically recognizable and resonant within the English readers' contemporary political climate, thus domesticating the text by aligning it with target culture norms and preoccupations, making the analogy more vivid and immediately relatable."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P022: Suposons qu'il n'y ait jamais eu nul commerce entre Paris &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">Saint-Denis</span></span>, &amp; qu'un Bourgeois de Paris qui ne sera jamais sorty de sa Ville, soit sur les Tours de Nostre Dame, &amp; voye Saint Denis de loin, on luy demandera s'il croit que Saint Denis soit habité comme Paris.

The English translation renders this as 'to feed Cattel'. While 'Cattel' (cattle) in 17th-century English could refer to livestock more broadly, it still narrows the meaning from potentially any grazing animals (wild or domestic) to specifically domesticated farm animals. This substitution domesticates the text by making the imagery more concrete and familiar within an English agricultural and pastoral context, aligning it more closely with target culture norms and experiences.","The translator significantly expands and reworks Fontenelle's concise explanation of synchronous lunar rotation, its visual consequences, and lunar libration. The French text presents these concepts in a single, somewhat condensed sentence. The English translation transforms this into a lengthy, multi-part pedagogical explanation. It elaborates on how synchronous rotation results in the same lunar face being visible (the 'one Cheek' example), describes the Moon's differing views of other celestial bodies versus the Earth, and explicitly introduces lunar libration as a 'wavering motion' accompanied by the Latin technical term '(motus libratorius)' – a term likely absent in Fontenelle's French original aimed at a popular audience. This extensive clarification and restructuring makes the complex scientific ideas more accessible and didactic for the English reader, transforming Fontenelle's more elliptical style into one that aligns with a potential target-culture preference for explicit scientific popularization and the use of scholarly terminology, thereby reducing the 'foreignness' of the original presentation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P026: Toutes ces Planetes, dit la Marquise, sont faites comme nous, qui rejettons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mesmes.

The English translation uses \"a Reformation\" (with a capital 'R' as given in the target text). In the English socio-political context of the late 17th century, \"Reformation\" was a highly resonant term, almost invariably evoking the Protestant Reformation and the ongoing religious and political turmoils. By choosing this specific, loaded term instead of a more neutral one like \"to correct them,\" the translator adapts the general concept to carry specific historical and cultural weight for the English audience, making the philosopher's caution resonate with contemporary anxieties. This aligns the text with target culture values and historical sensitivities.","The French \"nous sommes en Decours pour elles\" means \"we (the Earth) are in a waning phase for them (the Moon's inhabitants),\" extending the concept of lunar phases (like \"Pleine Lune\" or Full Moon, just used for \"Pleine Terre\" or Full Earth) to the Earth as seen from the Moon. The English translation \"and we are running from them\" changes this specific astronomical analogy of a diminishing phase of illumination into a generic image of movement or departure. This transformation simplifies the original scientific analogy, eliminating the precise parallelism Fontenelle was building, likely because the concept of Earth having \"phases\" was considered too novel or unfamiliar for the target audience, thus making the text more accessible by using a common, albeit less accurate, image."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je sçauray tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.

This aligns her speech with target culture linguistic norms for her social standing, domesticating her dialogue to resonate more naturally with an English audience of the late 17th/early 18th century.","The translator adds the word \"pray\" to the Marquise's question, which in the French source is a direct \"comment vont-elles?\" (how do they go/happen?). The interjection \"pray\" was common in 17th/18th century English to add politeness or emphasis to a question or request. Its insertion here domesticates the dialogue by adapting the Marquise's speech to conform more closely to English conversational etiquette and stylistic norms of the period, making her sound more like an English gentlewoman.","The French phrase \"pendant le jour dont elle joüissoit\" (literally \"during the day which it was enjoying\") includes the verb \"joüir\" (to enjoy), adding a subtle personification and literary charm by suggesting the Moon (or its inhabitants) actively experiences its daylight. The English translation \"in her day\" is more concise and neutral, eliminating this nuance of enjoyment. This simplification is a form of domestication, as it transforms a slightly more poetic or \"foreign\" stylistic element of Fontenelle's original French into a plainer, more direct English expression, potentially to align with target readership's stylistic expectations or to streamline the text.","The French verb \"dérober\" (to steal, to rob from) used in \"elle luy dérobe le Soleil\" (it steals the Sun from it/her) is vivid and metaphorical, implying a forceful taking. The English translation uses \"hides the Sun from that luminous half,\" where \"hides\" is a less intense and more common verb. This choice tones down the metaphorical strength and personification present in the original French. This is a domestication strategy that adapts the original's stylistic flair to a more restrained or standard English expression, making the text potentially smoother but less striking for the target audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P028: Je suis fort étonnée, dit la Marquise, qu'il y ait si peu de mystere aux Eclipses, &amp; que tout le monde n'en devine pas la cause.

The English translation uses \"Paws,\" a term for an animal's foot which is a different image and can be perceived as less directly threatening or more generalized than \"claws.\" This substitution slightly alters and potentially softens the demon's description, possibly to make the imagery less grotesque or more familiar to an English audience, thus reducing a 'foreign' visual element of the source text.","The French phrase \"ne la devineroient encore de long-temps\" (literally, 'would not guess/divine it for a long time yet') uses the conditional and suggests a prolonged difficulty rather than an absolute impossibility. The English translation \"will never understand them\" presents a more definitive and absolute statement of perpetual inability. This intensification is a form of domestication as it heightens the perceived ignorance of these 'Peuples,' potentially aligning with target culture stereotypes of 'primitive' societies as inherently incapable of scientific reasoning, thereby reinforcing the 'enlightened' reader's perspective.","The French source uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" (one) with the imperfect tense \"estoit persuadé\" (was persuaded/it was believed), indicating a past or reported belief concerning people in America. The English translation changes this to \"The Americans think,\" using a specific, generalized subject (\"The Americans\") and the present tense. This shift from a reported past belief of an unspecified group to an asserted current, general characteristic of \"The Americans\" is a domesticating strategy. It can reinforce colonial-era stereotypes within the target culture by presenting the beliefs of indigenous peoples as timeless, unchanging, and perpetually 'primitive,' thus fitting them into a familiar 'othering' framework.","The French term \"Magiciennes\" specifically refers to female magicians, sorceresses, or enchantresses, aligning with classical accounts of Thessalian witches who were believed to draw down the moon. The English translation uses the gender-neutral term \"Magicians,\" which, in the historical context, often defaulted to a male connotation or, at the very least, erases the specific female gendering of the original. This neutralization is a form of domestication as it might adapt the text to a target culture with different gender norms regarding magic, or it could generalize a specific cultural reference to avoid connotations (e.g., loaded associations with contemporary witchcraft, a sensitive topic) that might be unfamiliar or uncomfortable for the English readership, thereby making the reference less culturally specific."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P029: En verité, reprit-elle, tout cela est trop honteux pour les hommes, il devroit y avoir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">un Arrest du Genre humain</span></span> qui défendît qu'on parlast jamais d'Eclipse, de peur que l'on ne conserve la memoyre des sotises qui ont esté faites ou dites sur ce Chapitre-là.

In 17th-century France, 'Arrêts' were significant instruments of governance and law, issued by bodies such as the Parlements (high courts) or the King's Council. The English translation uses 'a general Edict.' The term 'Edict' denoted a sovereign's proclamation and would have been particularly resonant in late 17th-century England, given King James II's controversial use of royal declarations (like the Declaration of Indulgence) that functioned as edicts and notably bypassed Parliamentary authority. By selecting 'Edict,' the translator substitutes a concept tied to French institutional practice with one more familiar and politically charged within the contemporary English target culture. This act of domestication aligns the notion of a sweeping decree with the target reader's socio-political and legal framework, rendering it immediately accessible through a term ('Edict') that carried significant contemporary weight and associations in England. The addition of 'general' adapts 'du Genre humain' to fit an English phrasing that conveys wide applicability.","Consistent with the previous instance, the French phrase 'le mesme Arrest' (the same Decree) is translated as 'the same Edict.' This repetition reinforces the domesticating strategy of replacing the French institutional term 'Arrest' with 'Edict.' This choice consistently aligns the text with the target culture's familiar legal and political vocabulary, specifically invoking a term ('Edict') deeply embedded in the contemporary English discourse concerning sovereign pronouncements and their potential for overreach. This reduces the foreignness of the French original's terminology and enhances relatability for the English readership of that period by using a term directly relevant to their own political experiences."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P030: Dites-moy, je vous prie, une chose, dit la Marquise.

The translator changes \"un nombre prodigieux\" (a prodigious/vast number) to \"an infinite number,\" which is a hyperbole. More significantly, \"hommes... assez fous\" (men... foolish enough) is translated directly and emphatically as \"Fools.\" This shift from a descriptive qualification to a direct, somewhat harsher noun label, combined with the exaggeration of \"infinite,\" creates a more polemical tone. This could be a form of domestication by adapting the rhetorical style to what might have been perceived as more direct or common in English moral or satirical discourse of the late 17th century, particularly in a Protestant England where direct condemnation of perceived 'idolatry' (like adoring the Moon) would resonate. The change makes the statement more absolute and the condemnation more blunt, potentially aligning it with target culture rhetorical norms."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P031: Ne craignez rien, répondis-je, il n'y a pas d'apparence que nous soyons <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">la seule sotte espece de l'Univers.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à estre generalement répanduë</span></span>, &amp; quoy que je ne fasse que deviner celle des Gens de la Lune, je n'en doute non plus que des Nouvelles les plus seures qui nous viennent de là.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P026: Fear not, said I, it doth not appear that we are the only foolish Species in the World.

The English translation 'the World,' while potentially meaning 'cosmos' in older English, more commonly evoked the Earth or human society in the late 17th century. This substitution domesticates the original by reducing the grand and potentially unsettling cosmic scale of Fontenelle's statement ('la seule sotte espece de l'Univers') to a more familiar and contained concept ('the only foolish Species in the World'). This makes the idea more accessible to the target audience by framing it in terms less explicitly tied to the radical vastness of the new cosmology being popularized.","The French phrase 'L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à estre generalement répanduë' translates to 'Ignorance is something well-suited/apt to be generally widespread,' a witty but relatively straightforward observation.

This introduces a layer of ironic philosophical moralizing, framing ignorance almost as a paradoxical virtue or commodity.

This shift from a nuanced statement about the process of recognition (qualified by 'apparemment') to a more assertive declaration of a state of being ('is apparent') reduces the original's scientific cautiousness. This simplification makes the scientific observation sound more definitive, potentially to align with a perceived preference for more assertive scientific claims in the target culture or to make the information more straightforward for a popular audience.

Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les airs jusque dans la Lune, mon esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur vostre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en resaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdist jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sçachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le ratrape pas quand on veut. En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-estre icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne. Mais pour achever de m'oster le mien, dites-moy, &amp; dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune, car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une maniere assez positive. Moy, repris-je: Je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune. Voyez combien la face de la Nature est changée d'icy à la Chine; d'autres Visages, d'autres Figures, d'autres Moeurs, &amp; presque d'autres Principes de raisonnement. D'icy à la Lune le changement doit estre bien plus considerable. Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine; qui pourroit pousser jusqu'à la Lune, assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P030: As for the Sighs of Lovers, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, I know not whether in the days of Ariosto they were lost or not, but now adays I know none that go to the Moon. Were there none but you, Madam, said I, all those that have been address'd to you, are fled thither, and they are enough to make a considerable body. In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it. But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon. They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable.

The English translation uses 'Astolphus,' a Latinized form of the name. This is an instance of domestication where the form of a proper name is altered to conform to the linguistic and stylistic conventions more familiar to the target English readership of the period, which often employed Latinized versions for figures from romance literature. This change makes the name less foreign-sounding (specifically, less French) and assimilates it into an English literary context, thereby reducing a foreign element to receiving cultural values."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience?

It suggests a general, almost universal reluctant conclusion. The English translation 'It made some say' alters this by: 1. Replacing the general 'On' with the more specific 'some,' thereby attributing the saying to a particular, albeit undefined, group rather than people in general. 2. Shifting the construction from a passive sense of being 'reduced to saying' to an active 'It made... say,' where 'It' refers to the previously described nature of mankind. This change domesticates the original French philosophical generality by making the statement more concrete and anecdotal, potentially aligning it with English narrative or empirical stylistic preferences of the period. Furthermore, attributing a whimsical or pagan-derived explanation about 'the Gods' to 'some' rather than a universal 'On' (which might include the narrator or reader) could also be a subtle strategy to navigate the religious sensitivities of the late 17th-century English audience, making the idea less direct or universally endorsed."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoistra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connoistra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois serieusement, repliquay-je, qu'on ne sçait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moy, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres-ridicule, qui a un air de vraysemblance qui me surprend, je ne sçay où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'estat où estoit l'Amerique avant qu'elle eust esté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eust dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Ameriquains plus propres à estre traversées? En verité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous estes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siecles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mestier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont esté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune sçavent peut-estre déja faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sçait quelle surprise. Vous estes insuportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celuy-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sçay bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien seurs que la Zone Torride, &amp; les Zones Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur, &amp; du temps des Romains la Carte generale de la Terre n'estoit guere plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez-bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens. Le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous, on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu nostre habitation, il nous sera permis de connoistre celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la verité qui persuade, mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans l'esprit, qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois.

If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it. Ah! says the Marchioness, you now give me some comfort; your fallacious reasoning made me sick. I am now in a better condition to go to bed and sleep quietly, if you think fit that we retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P033: Oh! says she I reckon the Inhabitants of the Terra Australis as known; for 'tis certain they must needs resemble us very much, and in fine, we may know them when ever we take the pains to go see them, there they are and cannot avoid us; but the people of the Moon, we shall never know, 'tis that I despair of. If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple.

The English translation uses the idiom 'made me sick.' While the French describes a state of discomfort and pain, the English 'made me sick' is a common, more visceral idiom in English to express strong aversion, disgust, or exasperation. This adaptation makes the Marquise's emotional response more direct and idiomatically familiar to an English-speaking audience of the period, thereby domesticating the expression by aligning it with target culture linguistic norms for conveying such a strong negative reaction."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P034: THE Third Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P034: THE Third Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P039: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">La Marquise</span></span> voulut mégager pendant le jour à poursuivre <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">nos Entretiens</span></span>, mais je luy representay que nous ne devions confier nos chimeres qu'à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles, puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet.

This is a standard form of domestication, replacing a source-culture specific term (a French aristocratic title) with its direct target-culture counterpart, making it immediately recognizable and natural-sounding to an English reader of the period.","The French term \"Entretiens\" (conversations/discussions) in this context refers to the series of learned, philosophical, and scientific dialogues that are central to Fontenelle's work. Translating this as \"Entertainments\" shifts the emphasis primarily towards amusement and diversion. While Fontenelle's work is designed to be pleasurable and accessible, this choice adapts the concept of these intellectual exchanges to align more closely with potential English cultural norms and expectations for leisurely aristocratic pastimes of the era. This framing makes the activity seem more familiar to the target audience but may reduce the specific nuance of \"entretiens\" as a recognized French mode of focused, albeit charming, intellectual discourse, thereby domesticating its cultural specificity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences estoit habitée, pourroit bien ne l'être point; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril. Je ne soufriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'huy ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espece que l'on croit, &amp; en reserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse estre admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paye point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint Denis ressemble à Paris. Le Soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost un Païs, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mesmes changemens sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voila le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'éleve point de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que nostre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement ou il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoy, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-estre que de grandes cavitez. De la distance ou nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, repliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la verité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantost une partie, tantost une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes. Mais ces mesmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mesmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour estre imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mesmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-mesme, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme nostre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de nostre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied-là, il faudra que la matiere étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voila ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance. Cela nous fournira des fruits, des bleds, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons. J'entends des fruits, des bleds, des eaux à la maniere de la Lune que je fais profession de ne pas connoistre, le tout proportionné aux besoins de ses Habitans que je ne connais pas non plus.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P036: I have News to tell you, said I. The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not. From the moment that we have an interior motion in the parts of the Moon, or produc'd found by foreign causes, the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd, and we have a fund necessary for their subsistance.

The English translation \"but we must be content\" shifts this to a state of being satisfied or accepting. This adaptation domesticates the Marquise's reaction by potentially aligning it more closely with English cultural norms of the late 17th/early 18th century, which might have favored expressions of rational acceptance or composure over more explicit acknowledgements of needing or seeking emotional consolation.","The French phrase \"encore trop heureuse\" (still/even very happy) uses \"trop\" as a common intensifier meaning \"very.\" A literal English translation like \"too happy\" would imply excess. The translator uses the English idiom \"but too happy,\" an emphatic expression meaning \"very glad indeed\" or \"only too pleased.\" This is a domestication because it adapts the French manner of expressing strong happiness to a specific, somewhat formal English idiomatic convention of the period, thereby making the Marquise's speech conform to target culture's linguistic norms for expressing such sentiment."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empescher la communication des deux Planetes.

This domesticating move makes the imagined scene more directly experienced from the audience's viewpoint, enhancing its vividness and personal impact.

The English translation 'lay before us' employs a common English idiom that connotes a more orderly presentation, as if the aliens are arranged for convenient observation. This adaptation subtly alters the imagery from a scattering to a more direct offering for viewing, making the text smoother and perhaps more aligned with a genteel expectation for the target audience by using a familiar, less chaotic phrasing.","The French 'ils nous peschassent comme des Poissons' (they would fish us like fish) is translated with more concrete and elaborated imagery. The general act of 'fishing' (peschassent) is specified by the translator as 'lay Nets and Hooks,' adding details of method not explicit in the source verb. Furthermore, the simple comparison 'comme des Poissons' (like fish, focusing on the state of the fished) is rephrased to 'as we do for Fishes,' shifting the comparative focus to the human action of fishing. These changes transform a general concept into a more detailed scenario, making the image more vivid and potentially more immediately relatable by grounding it in familiar actions and details, a common domesticating strategy to enhance accessibility for the target audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P044: Songez, repliquay-je, que vous n'arriveriez que bien malade au haut de nostre Air, il n'est pas respirable pour nous dans toute son étenduë, il s'en faut bien, il ne l'est déjà presque plus au haut de certaines Montagnes, &amp; je m'étonne bien que ceux qui ont la folie de croire que des Genies corporels habitent l'air le plus pur, ne disent aussi que ce qui fait que ces Genies ne nous rendent que des visites &amp; tres-rares &amp; tres-courtes, c'est qu'il y en a peu d'entre eux qui sçachent plonger, &amp; que ceux-la mesme ne peuvent faire jusqu'au fond de cet air épais où nous sommes, que des plongeons de tres-peu de durée.

The translation to \"Perspectives\" (which could mean more complex optical instruments like telescopes/spyglasses – \"perspective glasses\" – or abstract viewpoints in 17th-century English) shifts the metaphor. This choice moves away from the simplicity of \"eyeglasses,\" potentially adapting the text to a perceived English preference for more formal, learned, or abstract terminology in philosophical or scientific discourse, thereby domesticating the original's direct, everyday imagery.","As with the previous instance, translating \"Lunettes\" (likely \"eyeglasses\" in the context of Fontenelle's popular style) as \"Perspectives\" alters Fontenelle's accessible metaphor. By choosing \"Perspectives\"—a term that could suggest more specialized optical devices or abstract \"viewpoints\"—over a more direct equivalent like \"glasses\" (used by other contemporary translators), the translator may be domesticating the text by elevating its register or abstracting its imagery to conform to perceived stylistic norms or expectations of the English intellectual audience for such works, rather than preserving the original's reliance on a common, everyday object.","The original French refers to \"Astrée,\" a central character in Honoré d'Urfé's pastoral romance \"L'Astrée,\" deeply familiar to Fontenelle's French audience, where Astrée is the beloved of Celadon. The English translation adds the possessive \"his\" (\"his Astrea\"). This addition serves as a clarification, making the specific relationship between Celadon and Astrea immediately explicit for an English readership potentially less intimately acquainted with the nuances of this prominent French cultural reference. This subtle insertion domesticates by enhancing the accessibility of the foreign cultural reference, ensuring its intended meaning is grasped without requiring the same depth of source-culture knowledge."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de Spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, repliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mesmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

The English translation strengthens this to the more assertive ''tis certain.' More significantly, the translator adds the phrase 'as to their Paradice,' introducing a specific Christian eschatological concept (Paradise) not present in Fontenelle's original. Fontenelle's text speaks of souls being transported to 'un autre Monde' (another World) and deriving happiness from this, drawing on classical philosophical ideas. The addition of 'Paradice' domesticates the text by adapting this philosophical speculation to align with a religious concept highly familiar and resonant within the 17th-century English Protestant cultural context. This makes the idea more accessible or perhaps less challenging to target readers by framing it within their established cultural-religious vocabulary."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut.

('it would still be necessary to find the model...' or 'one would still have to find the model...') expresses an impersonal, logical necessity to identify a specific, implied pattern as the next step in reasoning.

The translation \"'Tis most certain\" transforms this into a definitive assertion. This domestication alters the original's tentative, philosophical tone to one of greater certainty, potentially to align with a perceived English preference for more authoritative statements in scientific discourse or to make the novel ideas more assertively convincing to the target audience.","The French \"On dit\" (it is said/people say), from the phrase 'On dit qu'il pourroit bien nous manquer un sixiéme Sens naturel', grounds the idea in common discourse or general opinion.

This domestication elevates the register, lending the idea more philosophical weight, possibly to suit the expectations of a learned English readership for whom established thought might carry more authority than popular conjecture.","The French \"apparemment\" (apparently, seemingly), in the phrase 'Ce sixiéme Sens est apparemment dans quelque autre Monde', reflects Fontenelle's speculative approach to the possibility of a sixth sense on other worlds. The translation \"doubtless\" (certainly, without doubt) converts this conjecture into a strong assertion. This domestication reinforces the pattern of reducing the original's exploratory and nuanced tone in favor of a more assertive and definitive presentation, possibly to make the philosophical speculations appear more factual or authoritative to the English reader.","The French \"on s'ennuye\", from the phrase 'on ne connoist point l'Amour, & on s'ennuye', conveys \"ennui,\" a specific state of listless boredom and dissatisfaction with particular cultural resonance. The translation \"are uneasie\" shifts this to a more general sense of restlessness or anxiety.

This is an instance of domestication because it simplifies and concretizes a potentially abstract or multifaceted concept, making the speculation more tangible and perhaps aligning it with a more empirical or visually-oriented expectation within the target culture during the Scientific Revolution. By reducing the scope from a general inquiry about their being to a specific attribute ('Shape'), the translator makes the idea less philosophically open-ended and potentially more palatable or less challenging to the target audience, thereby reducing a 'foreign' speculative element to a more familiar, concrete term."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P054: QUATRIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P050: THE Fourth Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P050: THE Fourth Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P055: Les songes ne furent point heureux: ils representerent toûjours quelque chose qui ressembloit à ce que l'on voit icy.

The English translation renders this as 'the Voyage we had began about the World', where 'des Mondes' (of the Worlds) effectively becomes 'the World' (singular). Even if 'World' is interpreted broadly as 'cosmos' or 'universe', this change from the plural and specific 'Mondes' to the singular and more general 'World' diminishes the explicit emphasis on plurality. This generalization can be seen as a domesticating strategy, softening the controversial and 'foreign' idea of many distinct worlds by rephrasing it in terms of a more conventional, singular 'World' (e.g., the Creation or the cosmos). This would make the concept less direct and potentially more aligned with the target culture's norms, which might have been less receptive to the radical implications of numerous Earth-like worlds, especially in the given religio-political climate of England. The translator's ability (evidenced in prompt examples) to translate 'mondes' (plural) as 'Worlds' (plural) elsewhere makes this singular rendition a significant and deliberate choice.","The French 'certains Peuples' (certain peoples/nations) suggests specific, although unnamed, cultural groups. In the 17th-century French context, this could allude to non-European societies (e.g., as described in travel literature) whose artistic tastes for 'peintures bizarres & grotesques' contrasted with European realist art. The English translation 'those people' (followed by the defining relative clause 'who never draw any thing but what is extravagant and grotesque') transforms this into a more generic, abstract category of individuals defined by their artistic practice, rather than referring to specific cultural entities. This generalization domesticates the original by removing the potentially more concrete and 'foreign' allusion to actual, distinct cultures. Such specific ethnographic references might have been familiar or carried particular connotations for Fontenelle's French audience but could have been less familiar, or differently interpreted, by the English readership. The change makes the reference less tied to specific 'foreign' cultures and more of a general human typology, thereby reducing its cultural distinctiveness and potential unfamiliarity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: Vous m'affligez, dit la Marquise.

The English translation renders this as \"the most polite of Clelia\". While politeness was a component of these \"belles conversations\", the translation narrows the broader aesthetic and intellectual ideal of 'beautiful' (encompassing charm, eloquence, wit) to the more specific social virtue of 'polite'. This can be seen as domestication by adapting the French concept of ideal conversation to align more closely with English Restoration cultural values, where 'politeness' was a highly emphasized and specific ideal of refined social conduct and discourse.","The French phrase \"presider aux Amours\" suggests the Moon actively 'presiding over' or directing the love affairs of Venus's inhabitants, evoking a somewhat mythological or personified role, akin to a deity governing a domain, which aligns with the playful, 'précieux' literary style Fontenelle often employed. The English translation \"to influence the Loves\" shifts this to a more general and impersonal power, akin to astrological or natural philosophical concepts of celestial bodies 'influencing' terrestrial events. This change domesticates the text by toning down the more fanciful or overtly mythological French expression to one that might be more compatible with the empirical and perhaps more sober intellectual and religious sensibilities of the late 17th-century English audience, making the Moon's role sound less like active mythological governance and more like a natural, albeit subtle, force."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, interrompit la Marquise, comment sont faits les Habitans de Venus.

The English translation 'Feasting' narrows this to the specific activity of eating sumptuously. This is an instance of domestication because it adapts the broader cultural concept of 'Festes' by focusing on a more concrete and perhaps universally, or specifically English-resonating, aspect of celebration ('Feasting'). This choice, possibly also influenced by achieving stylistic parallelism in the English list ('Feasting, Dancing and Tilting'), makes the description more immediately accessible to the target audience but reduces the original scope which could include diverse entertainments beyond just eating.","The French 'des Tournois' refers to tournaments, which were complex chivalric events involving various games, pageantry, and contests.

As for the other Planets, they being beyond the Earth toward the Firmament, seem less to them than they do to us, and they receive but little or perhaps no Light at all from thence. The fixed Stars likewise seem less to them, and many are not seen at all, which in my opinion is a loss. I am not well pleas'd to see that great Arch adorn'd with lesser Stars, and not to see the rest but in a less proportion and a duller colour.</p>","explanations":["The French source text uses 'les Petites Maisons', which was a common name for a well-known Parisian asylum (Hôpital des Petites-Maisons) in the 17th century, thus serving as a culturally specific reference for a madhouse. The English translation replaces this with 'Bedlam', referring to the Bethlem Royal Hospital in London, an equally notorious asylum and a familiar reference for madness in English culture. This substitution of a French cultural-institutional reference with its English equivalent is a clear instance of domestication, making the concept more immediately accessible and resonant for the English-speaking audience of the time but replacing the original French cultural marker."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P059: Je ne suis pas si touchée, dit la Marquise, de cette perte-là que sont les Habitans de Mercure, que de l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de la chaleur.

The English translation 'therefore pray let us allow in Mercury long and abundant Rain to refresh them' domesticates this original expression. This domestication is achieved through several alterations: 1. The addition of 'pray,' a common marker of politeness in English speech of that period, which is not present in the French source. 2. The change from the active and assertive verb 'Donnons' (Let's give) to the more permissive and slightly less agentive phrase 'let us allow.' 3. The inclusion of the explicit logical connector 'therefore,' which creates a more formal and reasoned tone typical of English prose style. Collectively, these changes adapt the Marquise's manner of speaking to conform more closely with contemporary English cultural norms for genteel, polite, and perhaps more deferential discourse, especially for an educated female character. This potentially softens the vivacious and direct imaginative agency of the Marquise as portrayed in Fontenelle's original French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P060: Cela se peut, repris-je, &amp; mesme nous pouvons rafraîchir encore Mercure d'une autre façon.

The English translation alters this significantly: 1. It changes the source of the remedy: 'the Sun shall produce from it self a remedy,' implying the Sun, not Mercury, is the origin of the corrective measure. 2. It changes the Sun's impact from potential harm ('pourroit faire') to a definite past action ('that it caused') and intensifies 'mal' (harm) to 'evil'. This dual alteration domesticates Fontenelle's speculative scientific concept. By making the Sun the source of both the problem (now a definite 'evil it caused') and its solution (produced 'from it self'), the translation transforms Fontenelle's idea of planetary self-regulation (where Mercury's own composition reacts to solar heat). This change could make the concept seem more straightforward or align it with a perspective where a primary celestial body like the Sun has a more direct and encompassing agency, potentially more familiar or less challenging to the English reader of the late 17th century than Fontenelle's nuanced depiction of interdependent natural processes.","The French 'agréablement' suggests a pleasant or agreeable existence for the hypothetical inhabitants of Mercury. The English translation 'well enough' significantly tones down this positive connotation to imply a merely adequate, tolerable, or passable existence. This reduction in the level of optimism and charm, which is characteristic of Fontenelle's style, can be seen as a domestication. It adapts the speculative depiction of alien life to what might have been perceived as a more sober, less fanciful, or more 'reasonable' perspective for the English audience of the time, potentially making the text more aligned with a less effusive cultural or literary norm in England compared to the French original's optimistic speculation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P061: Aprés Mercure vous sçavez qu'on trouve le Soleil.

The English translation 'the cause is clear.' removes this rhetorical subtlety, opting for directness. This domestication aligns the philosopher's tone with a more straightforward explanatory style, potentially perceived as more suitable for an English audience by making the scientific discourse less playfully indirect.","The French 'Sçavans' (savants) is a general term for learned individuals or scholars. The English translation uses 'the Virtuoso's,' a term that in late 17th-century England specifically denoted individuals, often gentlemen, engaged in the new experimental philosophy and scientific inquiry, frequently associated with the Royal Society. This is a domestication that replaces a general source-culture term with a historically specific and evocative target-culture equivalent, making the described figures more familiar and resonant to the contemporary English reader.","The French 'faisoient leur Cour' (literally 'paid their court') describes the act of seeking favor or patronage, a nuanced social maneuver. The English translation 'began their Flattery' offers a more specific and pejorative interpretation of this action. This domestication adapts the concept by simplifying the motivation to 'flattery,' a readily understood, and perhaps more satirically pointed, behavior within the target culture, making the courtiers' actions more transparently negative.","The French describes a quarrel over 'who would remain master of the spots to name them as he wished,' emphasizing authority and control in naming. The English translation recasts this as a dispute over 'what Prince should be Godfather to the chief of those Spots.' The term 'Godfather' introduces a powerful and specific cultural metaphor from Christian (and particularly English) baptismal and naming traditions. This domestication adapts the original concept by using a vivid, target-culture-specific analogy, making the scenario more relatable and colorful for English readers but also imbues it with connotations from English religious and social customs."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

The English translation \"But to prevent all that, it is not made to be inhabited\" changes this by introducing a teleological explanation. It suggests that the Sun's uninhabitability is a purposeful design intended *to prevent* the negative consequence of its inhabitants being blind. This adaptation aligns the reasoning with the argument from design prevalent in natural theology, a significant aspect of the English intellectual and cultural context of the late 17th century, thereby domesticating the philosophical nuance by implying a benevolent purpose rather than a mere consequential state.","The French source text \"Mais la jolie chose que Jupiter avec ses quatre Lunes ou Satellites!\" is a direct and spontaneous exclamation expressing aesthetic wonder and admiration (akin to 'But what a fine/lovely thing Jupiter is with its four Moons or Satellites!'). The English translation \"But the jolly Iupiter with his four Moons or Satellits is worth a Visit.\" domesticates this by transforming the exclamation into a more measured, descriptive statement combined with a recommendation. The use of the epithet \"jolly Iupiter\" (where \"jolly\" in the period could mean fine or splendid, but also carried connotations of cheerfulness, potentially personifying the planet) and the additional phrase \"is worth a Visit\" alters the original's immediate expressive force. This aligns the passage with a potentially more reserved or conventionally evaluative English rhetorical style of the period, making the expression of wonder less direct and more mediated."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P064: Ah!

The translation \"pray make an end of fooling me\" domesticates this by recasting her impassioned plea as a more conventional, reserved request to stop being teased, thereby toning down her exuberance to align with potentially more subdued English norms of feminine expression and rationality.","The French \"je ne connois plus de retenuë sur la Philosophie\" is a bold declaration by the Marquise of abandoning all personal and social restraint in her pursuit of philosophical knowledge. The translation \"nor muse longer upon Philosophy\" domesticates this by changing her assertive stance into a mere expression of impatience with pondering, thereby reducing her intellectual audacity and passionate commitment to a more passive, conventional desire for information, fitting a more restrained female archetype.","The French idiom \"laissons parler le monde\" signifies \"let people gossip\" or \"let society say what it will,\" highlighting the Marquise's defiance of social norms that discouraged women from deep intellectual pursuits. The translation \"let us leave talking of the World\" (i.e., the cosmos) domesticates by misinterpreting this idiom, thereby eliminating the Marquise's bold, culturally distinct challenge to societal expectations and replacing it with a neutral suggestion to shift the topic of conversation.","The philosopher's French remark, \"c'est dommage qu'ils [her enthusiastic outbursts] n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet,\" carries a light, gallant tone, suggesting her passion might be wished for other (perhaps personal) objects, characteristic of French polite discourse. The English \"'tis pity there is any other Objects than Vortices\" shifts the focus to the supreme importance of Vortices. This domesticates by removing the nuanced French gallantry, making the dialogue more direct and less flirtatious, potentially aligning it with more reserved English conversational norms of the period between sexes in an intellectual context."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P065: Voila quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme le Maistre; mais en mesme temps les Planetes se composent de petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de celuy du Soleil.

This domesticates the original by adapting the personification of the Moon's relationship to Earth into a metaphor of social hierarchy that would be highly resonant and familiar within the English cultural context of the late 17th century, making the scientific explanation more vivid through established societal imagery.","The French \"de sa dépendance\" describes a state of dependency. The English translation \"attending on him\" transforms this into an active role of service or courtly attendance. This personification uses a social metaphor (like a courtier \"attending on\" a king) that would be familiar to an English audience of the period. It domesticates the concept by framing the planet-moon relationship in terms of a specific type of hierarchical social interaction prevalent in the target culture, thereby making the abstract idea of celestial dependency more concrete and relatable through a familiar social lens.","The French uses the impersonal pronoun \"on,\" equivalent to \"one\" or \"people in general,\" making the concluding philosophical remark universal. The English translation narrows this to \"a man.\" In the late 17th century, while \"man\" could be used generically, this choice reflects the prevailing patriarchal norms of English society and language, where the male was often the default representative of humanity. Given Fontenelle's work specifically aimed to include women in scientific discourse (being framed as a conversation with a Marquise), this translation domesticates the text by aligning it with a more male-centric perspective common in the target culture, potentially reducing the inclusivity intended or perceived in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes?

The English translation renders this as \"were design'd,\" a phrase that strongly suggests intentional creation by an intelligent agent. This choice domesticates the text by aligning it more closely with the prevalent teleological arguments within 17th-century English natural philosophy, particularly influential in Britain where figures like Newton interpreted scientific laws as evidence of divine design. This adaptation could make Fontenelle's work, which sometimes subtly challenged continuous divine intervention, more palatable or familiar to a target audience accustomed to reconciling science with religious belief in a divine designer.","The French source uses the metaphorical and evocative phrase \"ce jeu perpetuel d'Eclipses qu'elles font\" (this perpetual game of Eclipses that they make), which contributes to Fontenelle's characteristic literary charm and presents the astronomical phenomenon with a sense of wonder and playfulness. The English translation simplifies this to the more direct and factual \"their Eclipses,\" omitting the \"jeu perpetuel\" (perpetual game) metaphor. This alteration is a form of domestication as it tones down the original's distinctive literary embellishment and vivid imagery, potentially adapting the text to a more sober stylistic expectation for popular scientific discourse in the English context of the time, thereby reducing a nuance of Fontenelle's original voice which blended science with literary artistry."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P070: Et vous ne manquerez pas, dit la Marquise, à faire habiter ces quatre Lunes, quoy que ce ne foient que de petites Planetes subalternes, destinées seulement à en éclairer une autre pendant ces nuits?

This single source sentence corresponds to a much longer passage in the target text. This English passage introduces an elaborate political and colonial analogy, initiated by the Marquise (moons as 'Colonies drawn from him', receiving 'Laws and Customs', rendering 'Homage') and significantly amplified by the philosopher/narrator (moons sending 'Deputies' to Jupiter, making an 'Oath of Fidelity', and discussion of 'Superiority'). These concepts of colonial governance, allegiance, and political hierarchy were highly familiar and resonant within the late 17th-century British socio-political context, particularly given England's colonial activities and internal political dynamics concerning authority and loyalty. By reframing the Marquise's speculative thought through this lens, the translator makes the dialogue more concrete and relatable to the target audience by aligning it with their contemporary experiences and political discourse. The original French idea of the planet hanging overhead is only conveyed at the very end of this extended, domesticated passage."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit-elle, aprés que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la crainte des Eclipses, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The English translation uses 'the Common Law', which, particularly capitalized as it is in the target text, strongly evokes the specific English legal system derived from custom and judicial precedent. This system was a cornerstone of English identity and legal thought in the 17th century. By using this term, the translator domesticates Fontenelle's more general or philosophical concept by grounding it in a concrete, culturally significant, and familiar institution of the target (English) culture. This would make the Marquise's statement more resonant and possibly more authoritative for English readers of the period.","The French phrase 'je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner' (literally, 'I do not pride myself on being able to guess it' or 'I don't claim to be able to guess it') conveys a somewhat refined, possibly ironic, refusal to speculate, hinting at not wanting to appear pretentious. The English translation, 'I trouble not my head to guess,' is a more direct, colloquial, and informal expression, indicating a lack of concern or unwillingness to bother with guessing. This shift in tone and expression adapts the Marquise's speech. It makes her sound more like a plain-spoken English lady of the period, aligning her character's expression with target culture conversational norms and making her more familiar or relatable to an English audience, while potentially losing the social nuance of the original French phrasing."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P073: De bonne foy, je croy que cela est, répondis-je.

This shift from a future indicative, which can carry a tone of confident assertion or vivid imagining, to the more overtly modal and tentative phrasing ('may be') domesticates the original's speculative style. It potentially aligns the text with English cultural or intellectual norms of the late 17th century that might have favored a more cautious or epistemically modest presentation of radical scientific conjectures, especially those with philosophical or theological implications that challenged orthodoxy, thereby making the idea more conventional or palatable to the target readership.","The French term 'les Sçavans' (scholars, learned men, scientists) is translated as 'the Virtuoso's'. In late 17th-century England, 'virtuoso' was a culturally specific term referring to a gentleman scholar or scientist, often an amateur experimenter or collector associated with institutions like the Royal Society, characterized by wide-ranging intellectual curiosity in natural philosophy. This substitution replaces the more general French term with an English archetype deeply embedded in the target culture's contemporary scientific and intellectual scene.

This phrasing, particularly 'Being in Nature,' evokes the discourse of Natural Philosophy, which was highly influential in late 17th-century England (e.g., the work of Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton, and the Royal Society). This is an instance of domestication as it adapts the original's straightforward expression to align with the intellectual and linguistic norms prevalent in the target English culture, making the hypothetical Jovian philosophers' concerns resonate more directly with contemporary English scientific and philosophical discussions about existence within the natural world.","The French source refers to explorers on Jupiter as 'leurs Cristophles Colombs,' using the French form of Christopher Columbus's name, pluralized.

While Christopher Columbus is an international figure, the act of changing the French spelling and form of the name to a recognizably English one domesticates the reference.

Translating it to the more secular and general term \"kindness\" domesticates the text by neutralizing a problematic term, thereby aligning it with target culture religious sensibilities and ensuring broader acceptability.","The French \"une assez grande faveur\" (a considerable favour/a favour great enough) is translated as \"a great kindness.\" Using \"kindness\" for \"faveur\" (though \"favour\" is a direct English equivalent and lacks the primary theological charge of \"grace\") and simplifying \"assez grande\" to just \"great\" domesticates the text. This choice creates a plainer, more uniform vocabulary than the French original, which uses two distinct terms (\"grace\" and \"faveur\") and a more nuanced qualifier (\"assez grande\"). This reduces stylistic variation, likely aiming for broader accessibility or for consistency with the prior substitution of \"kindness\" for \"grace.\""]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P077: Je voy, reprit-elle, par ce nombre de seize Planetes qu'il faut que Saturne ait cinq Lunes.

The English translation opts for the more formal and elevated verb \"bestowing.\" \"Bestow\" implies a grand, deliberate, and gracious act of giving, often used for honors or significant gifts. This choice elevates Nature's act of providing moons to Saturn, aligning it with a potentially more reverent or teleological view of Nature's workings that might have been prevalent or preferred in the English cultural and religious context of the time (e.g., through the lens of Natural Theology). This makes Nature's actions seem more purposeful and majestic, adapting the tone to target culture expectations for discussing such grand natural phenomena.","In this clause from the French source, the pronoun \"le\" refers to \"le Soleil\" (the Sun), which is a grammatically masculine noun in French. The English translation renders this pronoun as \"him.\" While \"it\" would be a grammatically correct and more neutral translation for the Sun in English, the deliberate choice of \"him\" actively personifies the Sun. This aligns the text with a strong and established English literary and poetic tradition of personifying the Sun as male (e.g., as seen in the King James Bible and prevalent in poetry of the era). This adaptation makes the concept of the Sun more resonant and familiar within the target culture's established literary norms, thereby domesticating the text by appealing to target cultural stylistic preferences for personification.","The French source states \"il [Saturne] a des Pays,\" meaning \"it/he (Saturn) has countries/lands,\" a straightforward expression of possession. The English translation renders the core of this idea related to Saturn as \"Countreys in him.\" This phrasing changes the relationship from simple possession (\"has\") to the countries being located or inherent *within* Saturn (\"in him\"). This adaptation could make the concept of planets as worlds more vivid or align with a metaphorical understanding in the target culture where celestial bodies are envisioned as encompassing realms. It makes Saturn a more direct container of these lands, potentially enhancing the literary charm or popular appeal by using a more immersive image than simple possession, thereby aligning the concept with target culture preferences for vivid imagery in popular science."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P078: En verité, dit la Marquise, de l'air d'une personne qui rentroit en elle-mesme avec étonnement, tout cela est d'un grand ordre; il paroist bien que la Nature a eu en veüe les besoins de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">quelques Estres vivans</span></span>, &amp; que la distribution des Lunes n'a pas esté faite au hazard.

The English translation \"every living Being\" universalizes this provision. This adaptation domesticates the concept by aligning it more closely with prevailing teleological arguments in the target culture, such as the idea of a universally benevolent Providence or a perfectly ordered Nature, which were prominent in 17th-century English intellectual and religious thought. This makes Nature's design seem more complete and familiar, reducing the potential \"foreignness\" of a Nature with more selective or incompletely understood purposes.","The French source includes \"apparemment\" (apparently), which qualifies the verb phrase \"comptent pour\" (count/consider as) and explicitly marks the philosopher's statement about the inhabitants of Venus and Mercury as a conjecture regarding their perspective. The English translation, \"which they esteem...\", omits this crucial adverb of speculation. This omission renders the assertion about alien perspectives more direct and seemingly factual. This domestication reduces the \"foreignness\" of explicit conjecture about alien psychology by presenting the idea with greater certainty, potentially aligning the text with a more authoritative or didactic tone expected in popular science by the target audience of the era."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oyseaux.

The translation changes this to \"I,\" making the philosopher the proposer. This personalizes the scenario, shifting from a general temptation to a direct test by the philosopher. This simplification of the impersonal \"on\" to a specific \"I\" makes the dialogue more direct and focused on the two main characters, a common domesticating tactic to suit target literary expectations of the time by making the interaction less abstract.","The French \"vous vous borneriez à nous\" means \"you would limit yourself to us\" or \"you would content yourself with us\" (the philosopher and his philosophy/Vortices). The English translation \"and will be of our side\" introduces a common English idiom suggesting allegiance or taking a side. This reframes the Marquise's commitment in terms of partisanship, a concept highly resonant with the English socio-political context of the late 17th century (e.g., political factions). This adaptation domesticates the original nuance of self-restriction/contentment into one of active alliance more familiar to the target culture."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: CINQUIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P078: THE Fifth Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P078: THE Fifth Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P086:.

The English translation \"I am not out of the way\" uses a declarative English idiom of the period meaning \"I am correct\" or \"I am not mistaken.\" This shift from a questioning and somewhat formal tone to a more direct assertion, along with the use of a native English idiom, domesticates the Marquise's speech by adapting it to be more direct and conform to English idiomatic expression, potentially altering the nuance of her original tentative inquiry to suit target culture conversational norms.","The French proper names \"Phedre\" (for Phèdre) and \"Enone\" (for Oenone), characters from Jean Racine's tragedy, are anglicized to \"Phedra\" and \"Enone\" in the English translation.

It makes the dialogue immediately accessible and comprehensible to an English-speaking audience who might not understand French or be intimately familiar with the specific line, thereby prioritizing readability and narrative flow within this popular science work.

The English translation renders this part of the phrase 'voila l'Univers si grand' as 'why there's the Universe so big'. The introduction of 'why' as a colloquial interjection (e.g., 'Why, it's...!') adapts the Marquise's speech to a pattern more idiomatic and familiar in English conversational style, domesticating the original French exclamation to align with target language norms for expressing surprise or emphasis.","The French 'm'épouvante' conveys a strong emotional reaction of being terrified, dismayed, or filled with dread. The English translation 'astonishes me' significantly weakens this emotion to mean 'surprises me greatly' or 'fills me with wonder'. This domestication moderates the Marquise's expressed fear, possibly to align her reaction with perceived English cultural norms of female sensibility and rationality during the late 17th century, making her response to the vastness of the universe less visceral and more intellectually contained for the target audience.","In Fontenelle's astronomical context, 'le Ciel' primarily refers to 'the sky' or 'the heavens' in a relatively secular sense. The English translation uses 'Heaven' (capitalized), a term which, for a late 17th-century English audience, carried more immediate and potent religious connotations than simply 'sky'. Given the religious sensitivities and the prominence of the Anglican Church in England at the time, this choice domesticates the text by framing the cosmological discussion with language more resonant with the target culture's often religiously-infused discourse about the cosmos, subtly aligning Fontenelle's work with English cultural values."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P089: Vous m'offrez, dit-elle, une espece de Perspective si longue, que la veuë n'en peut attraper le bout.

The English \"drown'd\" (drowned) replaces this metaphor of visual depth with a different, more vivid English metaphor of being submerged or overwhelmed. This adaptation makes the idea of them being lost to perception more aligned with target culture's imagistic and metaphorical norms.","The French \"Je pretends bien que ma paresse profite de mes nouvelles lumieres\" (I fully intend for my laziness to benefit from my new insights) is rephrased as \"These new Lights I intend shall apologize for me.\" This shifts the conceptual structure from 'laziness benefiting' (where \"paresse\" is the subject of \"profite\") to 'insights apologizing/justifying' (where \"Lights\" is the subject of \"apologize\"). This adaptation aligns the Marquise's witty expression with a common English rhetorical strategy, making it sound more natural within English literary conventions of the time.","The French direct and strong expression of vexation \"je suis bien fâché\" (I am very annoyed/vexed) is translated with the predicate \"am not a little concern'd,\" which employs the English idiomatic understatement (litotes). This adapts the emotional expression to a stylistic norm common in English, especially in polite or more formal discourse of the period, thereby domesticating the philosopher's sentiment (linked to the subject \"I\" in the full English sentence) to sound more characteristically English.","The French noun phrase \"Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau\" (a little weakness for what is beautiful) is rendered as \"a little foolish inclination for the thing that's fair.\" The translator's addition of \"foolish\" to describe \"inclination\" (for \"foiblesse\") is not present in the source and subtly reframes the Marquise's self-assessment. This addition aligns the expression with a potential English societal tendency of the period to characterize such sentiments with a degree of conventional mild censure or trivialization, particularly when voiced by women or in polite self-deprecation, thus domesticating it to target culture norms of self-expression.","The French \"de beaux yeux\" (beautiful eyes) and \"une belle bouche\" (a beautiful mouth) within the clause \"ils ne vous gâtent point de beaux yeux, ou une belle bouche\" are translated as \"the Lustre of your Eyes\" and \"that pretty Mouth\" in the corresponding English clause. The term \"Lustre\" adds a specific quality of shine or radiance not explicit in the general \"beaux\" (beautiful) and was a conventional poetic descriptor for eyes in English. \"Pretty\" for \"belle\" (beautiful) is a common, sometimes slightly less intense, English term often used in contexts of gallantry. These choices adapt the compliment to more conventional English literary and social expressions of the period, making the philosopher's gallant remark sound more native to an English-speaking audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle en riant; il se sauve de tout, &amp; il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal.

The English translation replaces this general expression with the vivid and culturally specific English idiom 'and so to the Worlds end.' This idiom, meaning indefinitely or to a great extent, adapts the original by employing a familiar and forceful target language expression, making the philosopher's point more striking for an English audience of the period.","The French phrase 'il faut franchir le pas de bonne grace' (one must take the plunge / make the decisive step willingly or with good grace) is a moderately figurative idiom. The English translation 'you must e'en go on' (with 'e'en' as a contemporary contraction for 'even') is more direct, colloquial, and less metaphorical. This simplification of the French idiom transforms a somewhat foreign figurative expression into plainer English, making the text more immediately accessible to the target reader.","The French source, within the clause 'De là j'ay tiré que la Lune estoit habitée...' (From there I concluded that the Moon was inhabited...), uses the imperfect tense 'estoit habitée' (was inhabited). This frames the philosopher's past conclusion about the Moon's state at that specific time of reasoning. The English translation shifts to the present tense 'is inhabited' ('From hence I concluded that the Moon is inhabited...'). This alteration presents the speculative idea of lunar habitation as an ongoing, current state from the narrative's present, rather than strictly a past deduction about a past-perceived state. This makes the claim more direct and assertive, potentially to enhance its impact on a target audience engaging with these novel scientific ideas."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P091: Cela est hors de doute, répondis-je.

The translator domesticates this by specifying 'The people there' as the agent, referring concretely to hypothetical inhabitants of another world. This choice transforms Fontenelle's more detached or philosophically ambiguous statement about perception and classification into a specific, narrative action performed by imagined beings. Additionally, the verb 'attache' (attach, fix) is rendered as 'seat,' which, in conjunction with 'The people there,' can suggest a more deliberate, formal, or even anthropomorphized act of placement. This makes the concept more immediately accessible and vivid for the target reader by grounding it in concrete agency, but it reduces the abstraction and potential range of interpretation inherent in the original French 'On l'attache,' thereby aligning the text more closely with a potentially more narrative-driven expectation in popular writing for the English audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est de deviner.

The translation 'his Sun' introduces a masculine personification for the Sun, or for the Vortex as possessing the Sun. This aligns with common English literary and cultural conventions of personifying the Sun (or powerful natural entities) as male, adapting the text to target culture norms and making the imagery more familiar to English readers.","The French reflexive pronoun 'soy' (itself), referring to 'le Soleil' (the Sun as the agent: 'le Soleil...emporte ses Planetes avec soy'), is translated as 'with him.' While 'le Soleil' is grammatically masculine in French, 'soy' could be rendered neutrally as 'with itself' in English. The explicit choice of 'with him' personifies the Sun as male. This adaptation to a common English literary trope (male Sun) is a form of domestication, making the concept more aligned with target culture imagery.","The French idiomatic expression 'En voila bien assez' (That's quite enough / That's certainly enough) is translated using the English colloquialism 'There's e'en enough.' The use of 'e'en' (a contemporary contraction for 'even,' often used as an intensifier meaning 'indeed' or 'quite') makes the philosopher's speech sound more natural, familiar, and idiomatic to an English audience of the late 17th/early 18th century.

This change is an instance of domestication, where the translator likely opted for \"a million\" to create a more pronounced rhetorical impact on the English-speaking audience of the late 17th century. By employing a considerably larger and possibly more common hyperbolic figure for vastness in English popular discourse of the time, the translator aimed to render the Marquise's sense of awe more striking, thereby adapting the text for greater effect within the target culture, albeit at the cost of altering the specific scale and nuance of Fontenelle's original expression."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P094: Que serait-ce donc, repris-je, si je vous disois qu'il y a bien d'autres Etoiles Fixes, que celles que vous voyez; qu'avec des Lunettes on en découvre un nombre infiny qui ne se montrent point aux yeux, &amp; que dans une seule Constellation, où <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">l'on en comptoit</span></span> peut-estre douze ou quinze, il s'en trouve autant que l'on en voyoit auparavant dans tout le Ciel?</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P089: What would it be then, said I, if I should tell you that there are many more fixed Stars than those that you see, and that wirh a Telescope an infinite number are discover'd that did not appear to the eye, and that in one sole Constellation, where we usually reckon perhaps twelve, or fifteen, there are found to be as many as were seen before in the whole Heaven.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P089: What would it be then, said I, if I should tell you that there are many more fixed Stars than those that you see, and that wirh a Telescope an infinite number are discover'd that did not appear to the eye, and that in one sole Constellation, where <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">we usually reckon</span></span> perhaps twelve, or fifteen, there are found to be as many as were seen before in the whole Heaven.</p>","explanations":["The French source uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" with the verb \"comptoit\" (imperfect tense, meaning \"one counted,\" \"people counted,\" or \"one used to count\"), which presents the information in a more detached or generalized manner.

It makes the statement feel more immediate, familiar, and part of a shared understanding or common practice for the English-speaking audience (\"we\").

This is achieved by linking an abstract geometric concept to a concrete, familiar object from the target culture's recreational life, thereby making the idea more accessible and relatable to an English audience, consistent with Fontenelle's aim of popularizing science. This adaptation aligns the concept with target culture norms by using a familiar cultural item."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P097: Il y a beaucoup d'esprit, répondis-je, à avoir cette difficulté-là, &amp; mesme à ne la pouvoir résoudre; car elle est tres-bonne en soy, &amp; de la maniere dont vous la concevez, elle est sans réponse, &amp; c'est avoir bien peu d'esprit que de trouver des réponses à ce qui n'en a point.

This adaptation aligns the expression with target culture idiomatic norms, common in English polite or philosophical discourse of the period. It makes the text more accessible by using a familiar English phrasing but potentially smooths over the slightly more concrete, possibly rustic or practical nuance of the French idiom, thereby reducing a shade of its source culture distinctiveness.","The French term 'Ballon', referring to a generally inflated ball (often a game ball), is translated as 'Bladder', which specifically denotes an inflated animal organ. In the 17th-18th century, an animal bladder was a very common, tangible item in English daily life, used in games or as a float. By choosing 'Bladder' over a more direct equivalent like 'balloon' (in its older game-ball sense, which existed) or 'inflated ball,' the translator grounds the simile in a highly specific and familiar object of the target culture. This makes the image very vivid and accessible to English readers by linking it to their everyday experience, but it also imbues the simile with the particular connotations of a 'bladder' (organic, perhaps less 'elegant' or manufactured than 'ballon'), potentially altering the nuance of Fontenelle's original, more general term."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">J'aime fort</span></span> toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

The English translation \"I have a great kindness\" significantly tones down this emotion to a much milder, more formal, and somewhat indirect sentiment. This alteration can be seen as domesticating the Marquise's character by making her expression more reserved, potentially aligning her with perceived English societal norms of female decorum and modesty in intellectual discussions during the late 17th century.","The French term \"Balons\" (balloons, or large inflated balls) is used metaphorically by Fontenelle in the phrase \"J'aime ces Balons qui s'enflent & se desenflent à chaque moment\" to explain phenomena like Cartesian vortices. The English translation renders \"ces Balons\" as \"these Bladders.\" While \"balloons\" was an available word in English, \"bladders\" specifically refers to animal organs or bags made from them—common, everyday objects. This substitution grounds the scientific metaphor in a very familiar, concrete, and arguably more mundane or visceral image for the English reader. This choice makes the abstract concept more tangible but alters the original's imagery, potentially sacrificing some of its elegance or abstraction to enhance relatability within the target culture.","The French phrase \"j'aime à voir\" (I love to see), used by the Marquise to express her enjoyment of understanding the 'commerce de lumiere' (intercourse of Light) between worlds, indicates strong pleasure and delight in observation and comprehension. The English translation \"I am pleas'd to see\" conveys a more moderate level of satisfaction. This reduction in the intensity of the Marquise's expressed enthusiasm for learning and scientific discovery is another instance of toning down her character's overt passion, potentially to make her conform more closely to target culture expectations of subdued female expressiveness, especially in intellectual domains."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P099: Non, non, repris-je, ce n'est pas le seul.

The English translation \"we'l judge more certainly of it\" shifts the tone towards a more empirical, cautious, and evidence-based approach to knowledge. This aligns with the rising influence of Baconian empiricism and Newtonian science in England, which emphasized observation and certain judgment over speculation. This domestication adapts the original's epistemological nuance to resonate better with the prevailing English scientific cultural values that prized certainty and methodical judgment.","The French \"ennuyeuse\" primarily means \"boring\" or \"tedious,\" reflecting the Marquise's light-hearted desire for the \"diverting\" experience of cosmic travel. The English translation \"uneasie enough\" alters this to suggest discomfort, anxiety, or restlessness. This domestication likely aims to align the Marquise's sentiment with late 17th-century English cultural sensibilities. Simple \"boredom\" might have been perceived as frivolous or a sign of idleness (potentially viewed negatively within a culture with Puritan influences), whereas \"unease\" could be seen as a more profound, relatable, or morally acceptable human condition, possibly resonating with contemporary English discussions of melancholy or general existential restlessness, thereby making the character's reflection more serious or accessible to the target audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P104: Il ne faut donc plus songer, luy dis-je, à vous donner de la pitié pour les habitans d'une Comète, mais j'espere du moins que vous plaindrez ceux qui vivent dans un Tourbillon dont le Soleil vient à s'éteindre, &amp; qui demeurent dans une nuit éternelle. Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumiere; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; car que faire sans Soleil? Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? Je vous diray si vous voulez, répondis-je, ce que disent de fort habiles gens, que les Etoiles fixes qui ont disparu ne se sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est à dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mesmes, tantost ils nous presentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantost la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoistre, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons-nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mesmes? Vous estes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en vostre faveur. Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantost plus grandes, tantost plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus legers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur, il y a des Etoiles fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroistre &amp; disparoistre, &amp; enfin disparoissent entierement, des demi Soleils reparoîtroient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoistroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoistre de longtemps. Prenez vostre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'estre visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en luy-mesme une source de lumiere? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, répondis-je, nostre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des broüillards, ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces taches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toujours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée belle, dit-on. Le Soleil a esté tres-pasle pendant des années entieres, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'estoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire, la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa; mais si elle eust continué, nous estions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je sçay les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pasle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris-je: Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changemens: soit lents, soit prompts, mais toujours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens estoient plaisans de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoyent pas encore vû changer. Avoyent-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'experience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se laissoient des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoyent suivre</span></span>, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela elles diroient, nous avons toûjours vû le mesme Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours esté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroistroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir nostre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque-autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses mêmes qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attens bien que s'il disparoist des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroist de nouvelles, il faut que l'espece se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir esté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démeslez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je croy aisément que tout cela peut estre, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir esté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir esté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différens, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondemens d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naistre &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'estes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, repliquay-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au delà, il faudroit estre plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent estre ou n'estre pas si on veut, ou estre tels que l'on veut, il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P106: I need not then, continued I, think any more of persuading you to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, but I hope, at least, you will compassionate those that live in a Vortex where the Sun is extinct. How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd.

This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature.

The English translation replaces this with \"Posterity,\" a more abstract, formal, and somewhat grander term common in English literary and philosophical discourse when discussing long-term legacies. Additionally, the object being left, implied by \"l'\" (it) in the French (referring back to \"portrait\" or \"Mémoires\"), is specified as \"their Story\" in the English. The phrase \"leave their Story to Posterity\" is a recognizable English trope. This adaptation shifts the concept from a direct succession of record-keepers to a more generalized bequeathing of a narrative to future generations at large. This aligns the analogy with English literary and rhetorical norms of the period, potentially making the concept more familiar, resonant, or conventionally 'elevated' for the target audience by framing it in a style common for discussions of historical legacy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la teste tout le systeme de l'Univers! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">Je suis sçavante!</span></span> Oüy, repliquay-je, vous l'estes assez raisonnablement, &amp; vous l'estes avec la commodité de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra.

The translation to 'a knowing Woman' employs a more colloquial and less formal English expression. This domestication adapts the Marquise's declaration of her newfound knowledge to contemporary English social norms, potentially making her appear less overtly academic or 'foreign' in her expression. 'A knowing woman' frames her intelligence in terms that might have been perceived as more fitting or accessible for a female character within the English socio-cultural context of the late 17th century, emphasizing practical understanding rather than formal scholarly status.","The French 'le Ciel,' in the context of 'le Soleil, ny le Ciel, ny les Etoiles' (the Sun, nor the Sky, nor the Stars), most directly translates to 'the sky.' The English translation uses 'Heaven.' While 'Heaven' can refer to the sky, it also carries stronger religious and theological connotations, particularly significant in the highly religious socio-political atmosphere of late 17th-century England. Fontenelle's work often aimed to popularize a more rational, scientific view of the universe. By choosing 'Heaven' over the more neutral 'sky,' the translator may be subtly aligning the text with the target culture's prevailing discourse, where discussions of the cosmos were frequently intertwined with religious perspectives. This domesticates Fontenelle's potentially more secular term by framing the celestial realm in language more familiar and resonant with English religious and poetic sensibilities of the period."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">FIN</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P115: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P115: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">FINIS.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French source uses 'FIN', the French word for 'end'. The English translation uses 'FINIS.', a Latin term that was a standard conventional marker for the conclusion of printed books in England during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This choice domesticates the text by replacing the simple French word with a formal marker that aligns the book's presentation with the common publishing practices and expectations of the English target culture, making it appear more 'native' to that context, rather than using a direct English translation like 'THE END'."]}],"counts":{"manual":4,"ai":193}}
