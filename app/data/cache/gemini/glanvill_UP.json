Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">qui est plus touchante.</span></span> Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination,</span></span> sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je.</span></span> Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">j'aime les Etoiles,</span></span> &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle.</span></span> Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison?</span></span> Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, répliquai-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

But 'tis the Night, said she, that hears their Complaints, and how comes it to pass, the day is so little trusted with their secrets? I confess, Madam, said I, the night hath somewhat a more melancholly Air, than the day; we fancy the Stars march more silently than the Sun, and our thoughts wander with the more liberty, whilst we think all the world at rest but our selves: Besides, the day is more uniform, we see nothing but the Sun, and light in the Firmament; whilst the night gives us variety of Objects, and shews us ten thousand Stars, which inspire us with as many pleasant Ideas.

This addition makes the narrator's internal monologue more explicit and expansive, emphasizing the distraction caused by the lady's presence in a manner suited to English conversational style.","The translator added the adjective 'soft' to the description of the 'brown Beauty.' While the source uses 'plus touchante' (more moving/touching), the addition of 'soft' provides an extra layer of sensory detail, possibly to create a richer contrast with the 'fair Beauty' described as 'clear and dazzling'.","The translator significantly elaborated on the source's simple negation 'vous qui ne l'estes pas' (you who are not [brown-haired]). The added phrase 'that have all the Charms that belong to the Fair:' turns the narrator's observation into an explicit and gallant compliment about the Marquise's (Countess's) fairness and associated charms.","The translator added the clause 'and that Beauty must be perfect,' to the description of heroines of romances. While the source states that these heroines represent 'what is most beautiful in imagination,' the target text inserts an additional assertion that this beauty, derived from imagination, is inherently perfect.","The translator replaced the Marquise's original line (where she comments on the narrator's reverie being induced by the night) with an entirely new question about why lovers address the night in their songs and elegies. This constitutes a significant addition of content that redirects the conversation, introducing a new topic not present at this point in the source.","The translator added the clause 'that crowns their Joys, and therefore' to the narrator's response. The source simply states that the night deserves lovers' thanks; this addition provides an explicit reason for these thanks, making the narrator's point more developed.","The translator added 'and shews us ten thousand Stars,' introducing a vivid, though figurative, numerical detail not present in the source's description of stars. Furthermore, the clause 'which inspire us with as many pleasant Ideas.' is an addition that offers a more direct and positively framed cognitive outcome than the source's more nuanced 'favors reverie, & a certain disorder of thoughts'.","The translator elaborated on the Marquise's statement 'j'aime les Etoiles' (I love the stars) by adding the clause ', there is somewhat charming in them'. This addition provides a brief reason or an expansion of her expressed affection for the stars.","The translator added the phrase ', I discover none?' to the Marquise's question about the narrator's 'folly'. This addition makes her response more engaging and encouraging, suggesting she does not perceive his ideas negatively and is curious to hear them.","The translator inserted the phrase 'I fear you will not relish,' before the narrator's comparison of the pleasure of his ideas to that of a Moliere play. This addition introduces an element of the narrator's apprehension or polite deference concerning the Marquise's tastes, a nuance not explicitly stated in the source.","The translator characterized the pleasure derived from the narrator's ideas as being 'rather of the fancy than of the Judgment.' This replaces the source's vaguer 'one that is I know not where in reason, & which only makes the mind laugh' with a specific English philosophical or aesthetic distinction, thereby contextualizing the idea for the target audience.","The translator added 'I hope, ' at the beginning of the Marquise's speech. This addition softens her subsequent question about being incapable of rational pleasures, making her tone more polite and less abrupt than the source's 'Quoy donc' (What then)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder.</span></span> Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière de Physique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; &amp; les Planètes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des mondes. J'en revenois toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais;</span></span> car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes: &amp; si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">ce qui reviendrait au même.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Mais on veut savoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est là la difficulté.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyait bien, ce serait toujours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voient point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier.</span></span> Sur cela je me figure toujours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opéra. Du lieu où vous êtes à l'Opéra, vous ne voyez pas le Théâtre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à votre veue ces roues &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvements. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner comment tout cela joue.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté.</span></span></span></span> Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien qu'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers;</span></span> car représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Suposons qu'ils voyaient le Vol de Phaéton que les Vents enlèvent, qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé.</span></span></span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">L'autre, Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas.</span></span> L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">&amp; cent autres rêveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité.</span></span> A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps;</span></span> &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenue bien mécanique? Si mécanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bientôt honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvements régléz qui dépendent de l'arrangement des parties. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">Avouez la vérité.</span></span> N'avez-vous pas eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne méritoit? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">J'ay vu des gens qui l'en estimoient moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoient connu.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">Et moy, répliqua-t'elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sais qu'il ressemble à une Montre.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P004: But in vain I excus'd my self, who could resist so many Charms? I was forc'd to yield, and yet I knew not where to begin; for to a Person who understood nothing of Natural Philosophy you must go a great way about to prove that the Earth may be a Planet, the Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars worlds; however to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I at last resolv'd on this Method. All Philosophy, said I, Madam, is founded upon two things, either that we are too short sighted, or that we are too curious; for if our eyes were better than they are, we should soon see whether the Stars were worlds or not; and if on the other side we were less curious, we should not care whether the Stars are Worlds or not, which I think is much to the same purpose. But the business is, we have a mind to know more than we see: And again, if we could discern well what we do see, it would be so much known to us: But we see things quite otherwise than they are. So that your true Philosopher will not believe what he doth see, and is alwaies conjecturing at what he doth not, which is a Life I think not much to be envy'd: Upon this I fancy to my self, that Nature very much resembleth an Opera, where you stand, you do not see the Stage as really it is; but it is plac'd with advantage, and all the Wheels and Movements are hid, to make the Representation the more agreeable: Nor do you trouble your self how, or by what means the Machines are moved, tho' certainly an Engineer in the Pit is affected with what doth not touch you; he is pleas'd with the motion, and is demonstrating to himself on what it depends, and how it comes to pass. This Engineer then is like a Philosopher, tho' the difficulty is greater on the Philosophers part, the Machines of the Theatre being nothing so curious as those of Nature, which disposeth her Wheels and Springs so out of sight, that we have been long a guessing at the movement of the Universe. Suppose then the Sages at an Opera, the Pithagoras's, the Plato's, the Aristotles, and all the Wise Men who have made such a noise in the World, for these many Ages: We will suppose 'em at the Representation of Phaeton, where they see the aspiring Youth lifted up by the Winds, but do not discover the Wires by which he mounts, nor know they any thing of what is done behind the Scenes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">Would you have all these Philosophers own themselves to be stark Fools, and confess ingenuously they know not how it comes to pass: No, no, they are not called Wise Men for nothing; tho', let me tell you, most of their Wisdom depends upon the ignorance of their Neighbours. Every man presently gives his Opinion, and how improbable so ever, there are Fools enough of all sorts to believe 'em</span></span>: One tells you Phaeton is drawn up by a hidden Magnetick Vertue, no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question. Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra: A third tells you, Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company, with an hundred such extravagant fancies, that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers: But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera. I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it; they will have the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement. But pray tell me, Madam, had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe? Do you not think you did then honour it more than it deserv'd? For most have the less esteem of it since they have pretended to know it.

So that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">your</span></span> true Philosopher will not believe what he doth see, and is alwaies conjecturing at what he doth not, which is a Life I think not much to be envy'd: Upon this I fancy to my self, that Nature very much resembleth an Opera, where you stand, you do not see the Stage as really it is; but it is plac'd with advantage, and all the Wheels and Movements are hid, to make the Representation the more agreeable: Nor do you trouble your self how, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">or by what means the Machines are moved,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">tho' certainly</span></span> an Engineer in the Pit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">is affected with what doth not touch you; he is pleas'd with the motion, and is demonstrating to himself on what it depends, and how it comes to pass.</span></span> This Engineer then is like a Philosopher, tho' the difficulty is greater on the Philosophers part, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">the Machines of the Theatre being nothing so curious as those of Nature,</span></span> which disposeth her Wheels and Springs so out of sight, that we have been long a guessing at the movement of the Universe. Suppose then the Sages at an Opera, the Pithagoras's, the Plato's, the Aristotles, and all the Wise Men who have made such a noise in the World, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">for these many Ages:</span></span> We will suppose 'em at the Representation of Phaeton, where they see the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">aspiring Youth</span></span> lifted up by the Winds, but do not discover the Wires by which he mounts, nor know they any thing of what is done behind the Scenes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Would you have all these Philosophers own themselves to be stark Fools, and confess ingenuously they know not how it comes to pass: No, no, they are not called Wise Men for nothing; tho', let me tell you, most of their Wisdom depends upon the ignorance of their Neighbours. Every man presently gives his Opinion, and how improbable so ever, there are Fools enough of all sorts to believe 'em:</span></span> One tells you Phaeton is drawn up by a hidden Magnetick Vertue, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question.</span></span> Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra:</span></span> A third tells you, Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company,</span></span> with an hundred such extravagant fancies, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers:</span></span> But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">and forc'd</span></span> by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera. I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it; they will have the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">But pray tell me, Madam,</span></span> had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe?

While the source describes the engineer as being 'concerned' ('s'inquiète') and wanting to 'untangle' ('démêler') an extraordinary mechanism, the target text adds that he 'is affected with what doth not touch you,' 'is pleas'd with the motion,' and 'is demonstrating to himself on what it depends, and how it comes to pass.' This addition elaborates on the engineer's intellectual engagement and pleasure in understanding the mechanics, adding layers not present in the source.","The translator inserted a comparative clause, 'the Machines of the Theatre being nothing so curious as those of Nature,' which is not present in the source. This addition serves to emphasize the greater complexity and inscrutability of Nature's mechanisms compared to man-made theatrical devices, thereby highlighting the philosopher's challenge.","The translator added 'for these many Ages' to elaborate on the enduring fame of the ancient philosophers. While the source text's 'aujourd'huy' (today) implies current renown, the addition extends this recognition explicitly over a long historical period.","The translator added the epithet 'aspiring Youth' to describe Phaeton. This provides a descriptive characterization not present in the source's simple mention of 'Phaéton,' likely to add literary color or remind the audience of Phaeton's mythological characteristic ambition.","The translator inserted a substantial commentary on the nature of these 'Sages' and their pronouncements. This passage, which satirizes the philosophers' pretense of knowledge and the credulity of their audience, is entirely absent from the source text and reflects the translator's own interpretative layer or desire to add a more cynical/humorous tone.","The translator added a sarcastic commentary 'no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question' after the first philosopher's explanation. This embellishment introduces a humorous and critical tone towards the vague pronouncements of ancient philosophers, which is not present in Fontenelle's more straightforward reporting.","Following the second philosopher's theory, the translator inserted the derisive comment 'and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra.' This addition serves to ridicule the numerological explanation by highlighting the philosopher's supposed ignorance, a critique absent from the original text.","The translator expanded on Phaeton's 'amitié' (friendship/liking) for the top of the theatre ('il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas' - he is not at ease when he is not there) by adding the simile 'and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company.' This poetic elaboration personifies Phaeton more vividly and romantically.","The translator replaced Fontenelle's expression of astonishment ('que je m'étonne') that such 'rêveries' (daydreams/fantasies) hadn't ruined Antiquity's reputation with the assertion 'that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers.' This changes the original sentiment to a conclusion that the Sages were intentionally jesting, an interpretative addition.","The translator used a doublet 'push'd and forc'd' to render the French 'poussé' (pushed). 'Forc'd' adds emphasis or a slightly different nuance of compulsion not strictly present in the single word 'poussé,' common in English rhetoric of the period.","The translator replaced the direct 'Avouez la vérité.' (Admit the truth.) with the more polite and conventional English conversational phrase 'But pray tell me, Madam,', softening the demand and adding a customary address.","The translator changed 'J'ay vu des gens qui l'en estimoient moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoient connu.' (I have seen people who esteemed it less, since they had known it.) to 'For most have the less esteem of it since they have pretended to know it.' This alteration generalizes 'some people' to 'most' and critically adds 'pretended to know it,' implying their diminished esteem comes from a superficial or false understanding.","The translator added the phrase 'I am not of their opinion,' at the beginning of the Marquise's (Countess's) reply. This explicitly links her statement as a counterpoint to the previously mentioned 'most' who esteem the universe less, providing a clearer argumentative connection not explicitly phrased this way in the source.","The translator replaced the source's 'Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples.' (It is surprising that the order of Nature, as admirable as it is, only turns on such simple things.) with 'and the whole order of Nature the more plain and easie it is, to me it appears the more admirable.' This shifts the emphasis from the surprise at simplicity to a direct correlation where simplicity ('plain and easie') itself becomes a reason for admiration, using a 'the more...the more...' construction for rhetorical effect."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P005: Je ne sais pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">mais en vérité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir.</span></span> Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la tête un faux Merveilleux envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent.

The source text's 'il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir' (it is not too common to have them) is less direct. This addition enhances the politeness and directness of the compliment for the target audience.","The translator added 'below Legerdemain' to specify and intensify the disdain for understood nature. The source 'deshonorée' (dishonored) is general; 'Legerdemain' (sleight of hand/conjuring tricks) introduces a concrete, culturally familiar comparison for the English reader, suggesting that easily understood Nature is valued less than a common trick.","The source 'De la Terre où nous sommes,' (From the Earth where we are) integrates the locational information.

Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question?</span></span></span></span> Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême.</span></span> Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible.</span></span></span></span> Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries.</span></span> L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">il lui eust donné de bons avis.</span></span> La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes.</span></span> Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs.</span></span> Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal.

Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire;</span></span> tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces.</span></span> Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle.</span></span> Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës.</span></span></span></span></span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit?</span></span> C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\">Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre?</span></span> Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre</span></span></span></span>, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\">Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut.</span></span> Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation. Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"29\">Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion.</span></span> Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire. Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours</span></span>; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, 'tis not a true Shepherds life to talk of the Stars and Planets: See if they pass their time so in Astrea. That sort of Shepherds Craft, reply'd she, is too dangerous for me to learn: I love the honest Caldaeans, and you must teach me their Rules, if you would have me improve in their Science. But let us proceed, When they had rank'd the Heavens in that manner you tell me, pray, what is the next Question? The next, said I, is the disposing the several parts of the Universe, which the Learned call making a Systeme; but before I expound the first Systeme, I would have you observe, we are all naturally like that Mad man at Athens, who fancy'd all the Ships were his that came into the Port Pyroeum: Nor is our Folly less extravagant, we believe all things in Nature design'd for our use; and do but ask a Philosopher, to what purpose there is that prodigious company of fix'd Stars, when a far less number would perform the service they do us? He answers coldly, they were made to please our Sight. Upon this Principle they imagin'd the Earth rested in the Centre of the Universe, while all the Celestial Bodies (which were made for it) took the Page 15 pains to turn round to give light to it. They plac'd the Moon above the Earth, Mercury above the Moon, after Venus the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, above all these they set the Heaven of fix'd Stars, the Earth was just in the middle of those Circles which contain the Planets, and the greater the Circles were, they were the farther distant from the Earth, and by consequence the farthest Planets took up the most time in finishing their course, which in effect is true: But why, said the Countess, interrupting me, do you dislike this Systeme? It seems to me very Clear and Intelligible. However, Madam, said I, I will make it plainer; for should I give it you as it came from Ptolomy its Author, or from some who have since study'd it, I should fright you, I fancy, instead of diverting you. Since the Motions of the Planets are not so regular, but that sometimes they go faster, sometimes slower, sometimes are nearer the Earth, and sometimes farther from it; the Ancients did invent I do not know how many Orbs or Circles involv'd one within another, which they thought would salve all Objections; this confusion of Circles was so great, that at that time when they knew no better, a certain King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but not much troubled with Religion, said, That had God consulted him when he made the World, he would have told him how to have fram'd it better. The fancy was very Atheistical, and no doubt the Instructions he would have given the Almighty, was the suppressing those Circles with which they had clog'd the Celestial Motions, and the taking away two or three superfluous Heavens which they had placed above the fixed Stars; for these Philosophers to explain the Motion of the Celestial Bodies, had above the uppermost Heaven (which we see,) found another of Crystal, to influence and give Motion to the inferiour Heavens; and wherever they heard of another Motion, they presently clapp'd up a Crystal Heaven which cost 'em Page 17 nothing. But why must their Heaven be of Crystal, said the Countess, would nothing else serve as well? No, no, I reply'd, nothing so well; for the Light was to come thro' them, and yet they were to be solid. Aristotle would have it so, he had found Solidity to be one of their Excellencies, and when he had once said it, no body would be so rude as to question it. But it seems there were Comets much higher than the Philosophers expected, which as they pass'd along brake the Crystal Heavens, and confounded the Universe. But to make the best of a bad Market, they presently melt down their broken Glass, and to Aristotles Confusion, made the heavens fluid; and by the observations of these latter Ages it is now out of doubt, that Venus and Mercury turn round the Sun, and not round the Earth, according to the Antient Systeme, which is now every where exploded, and all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush. But that which I am going to lay down, will salve all, and is so clear, that the King of Arragon himself may spare his Advice. Methinks, saith the Countess, your Philosophy is a kind of Out-cry, where he that offers to do the work cheapest, carries it from all the rest. 'Tis very true, said I, Nature is a great Huswife, she always makes use of what costs least, let the difference be never so inconsiderable; and yet this frugality is accompany'd with an extraordinary magnificence, which shines thro' all her works; that is, she is magnificent in the design, but frugal in the Execution; and what can be more praise worthy, than a great design accomplish'd with a little Expence? But in our Ideas we turn things topsy-turvy, we place our thrift in the design, and are at ten times more charge in Workmanship than it requires, which is very ridiculous: Imitate Nature then, saith she, in your Systeme, and give me as little trouble as you can to comprehend you. Fear it not, Madam, said I, we have done with our impertinencies: Imagine then a German all'd Copernicus confounding every thing, earing in pieces the beloved Circles of Antiquity, and shattering their Crystal Heavens like so many Glass Windows, seiz'd with the noble Rage of Astronomy, he snatcheth up the Earth from the Centre of the Universe, sends her packing, and placeth the Sun in the Centre to which it did more justly belong, the Planets no longer turn round the Earth, and do not inclose it in the Circles they describe; if they give us light, it is but by chance, and as they meet us in their way. All now turns round the Sun, the Earth her self goes round the Sun, and Copernicus to punish the Earth for her former Lazyness, makes her contribute all he can to the motion of the Planets and Heavens, and now stripp'd of all the heavenly Equipage with which she was so gloriously attended, she hath nothing left her but the Moon, which still turns round about her: Fair and softly, saith the Countess, I fancy you your self are seiz'd with the Noble Fury of Astronomy; a little less Rapture, and I shall understand you the better. The Sun You say is in the Centre of the Universe, and is immovable; what follows next? It is Mercury, said I, he turns round the Sun, so that the Sun is the Centre of the Circle wherein Mercury moves; above Mercury is Venus, who turns also round the Sun; after comes the Earth, which being placed higher than Mercury and Venus, makes a greater circle round the Sun than either of them; at last come Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, in the same order I name 'em, so that Saturn hath the greatest circle round the Sun, which is the reason he is a longer time in making his Revolution than any of the other Planets. And the Moon, you have forgot her, said she: We shall quickly find her again, said I; the Moon turns round the Earth, and doth not leave her, but as the Earth advanceth in the Circle, which she describes about the Sun, and if the Moon turns round the Sun, it is because she will not quit the Earth; I understand you, said she, and I love the Moon for staying with us when all the other Planets do abandon us; nay, I fear your German would have willingly taken her away too if he could, for in all his proceedings, I find he had a great spight to the Earth. 'Twas well done of him, said I, to abate the Vanity of Mankind, who had taken up the best place in the Universe, and it pleaseth me to see the Earth in the croud of the Planets. Sure, said she, you do not think their Vanity extends it self as far as Astronomy! Do you believe you have humbled me, in telling me the Earth goes round the Sun? For my part I do not think my self at all the worse for't. I confess, said I, Madam, I believe a Fair Lady would be much more concern'd for her place at a Ball, than for her rank in the Universe; and the Precedence of two Planets will not make half such a noise in the World, as that of two Ambassadours; however the same inclination which reigns at a Ceremony, governs in a Systeme, and if you love the uppermost place in the one, the Philosopher desires the Centre in the other; he flatters himself that all things were made for him, and insensibly believes a matter of pure speculation to be a point of Interest. This is a Calumny, said she, you have invented against Mankind; why did they receive this Systeme if it was so abasing? I know not, said I, but I am sure Copernicus himself distrusted the success of his Opinion, he was a long time before he would venture to publish it, nor had he done it then without the importunity of his Friends. But do you know what became of him? the very day they brought him the first Proof of his Book, he dy'd; he foresaw he should never be able to clear all the contradictions, and very wisely slipt out of the way. I would be just to all the World, said the Countess; but 'tis hard to fancy we move and yet see we do not change our place; we find our selves in the Morning where we lay down at Night: Perhaps you will tell me the whole Earth moves-Yes certainly, said I, it is the same case as if you fell asleep in a Boat upon the River, when you awake you find your self in the same place, and the same situation in respect of all the parts of the Boat. 'Tis true, she reply'd, but here's a great difference when I awake I find another shoar, and that shows me, my Boat hath chang'd place. But 'tis not the same with the Earth, I find all things as I left 'em. No, no, said I, there is another Shoar too; You know that beyond the circles of the Planets are fix'd Stars, there is our Shoar. I am upon the Earth, and the Earh makes a great circle round the Sun, I look for the centre of the circle and see the Sun there, I then direct my sight beyond the Sun in a right Line, and should certainly discover the fix'd Stars which answer to the Sun, but that the light of the Sun effaceth 'em: But at Night I easily perceive the Stars which corresponded with him in the day, which is exactly the same thing; if the Earth did not change its place in the Circle where it is, I should see the Sun always against the same fix'd Stars, but when the Earth doth change its place, the Sun must answer to other Stars and there again is your Shoar, which is always changing. And seeing the Earth makes her circle in a year, I see the Sun likewise in the space of a year answer successively to the whole Circle of the fix'd Stars, which Circle is call'd the Zodiack: I will draw you the Figure of it, if you please, on the Sand? 'Tis no matter, said she, I can do well enough without it; beside, it will give an Air of Learning to my Park which I would not have in it: For I have heard of a certain Philosopher, who being Shipwrack'd, and cast upon an unknown Island, seeing several Mathematical Figures trac'd on the Sea-shore, cry'd out to those that follow'd him, Courage, Courage, my Companions, the Isle is inhabited, behold the Footsteps of Men; But you may spare your Figures, such Footsteps are not decent here.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy.

I am upon the Earth, and the Earh makes a great circle round the Sun, I look for the centre of the circle and see the Sun there, I then direct my sight beyond the Sun in a right Line, and should certainly discover the fix'd Stars which answer to the Sun, but that the light of the Sun effaceth 'em: But at Night I easily perceive the Stars which corresponded with him in the day, which is exactly the same thing; if the Earth did not change its place in the Circle where it is, I should see the Sun always against the same fix'd Stars, but when the Earth doth change its place, the Sun must answer to other Stars and there <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">again is your</span></span> Shoar, which is always changing. And seeing the Earth makes her circle in a year, I see the Sun likewise in the space of a year answer successively to the whole Circle of the fix'd Stars, which Circle is call'd the Zodiack: I will draw you the Figure of it, if you please, on the Sand? 'Tis no matter, said she, I can do well enough without it; beside, it will give an Air of Learning to my Park which I would not have in it: For I have heard of a certain Philosopher, who being Shipwrack'd, and cast upon an unknown Island, seeing several Mathematical Figures trac'd on the Sea-shore, cry'd out to those that follow'd him, Courage, Courage, my Companions, the Isle is inhabited, behold the Footsteps of Men; But you may spare your Figures, such Footsteps are not decent here.</p>","explanations":["This phrase adds a motivation for the Marquise's request (to improve in their science), making her desire to learn more explicit and goal-oriented, which is not directly present in the source's more general 'parler Caldéen' (speak Chaldean).","This phrase is added as a conversational transition to move the dialogue forward, enhancing naturalness in English.","This word is added to the question as a polite emphasis, common in English conversational style.","This phrase is added as a polite transitional marker, common in English dialogue to soften the introduction of a point.","This colloquial English phrase is added by the narrator to express his supposition in a more personal and conversational tone.","This phrase is added to clarify the speaker's primary intent (to divert/entertain) and contrasts it with the potential negative effect of the complex explanation, enhancing the rhetorical point.","The addition of 'they thought' introduces a layer of skepticism or historical perspective from the narrator, suggesting that the Ancients' solution ('salve all Objections') was based on their belief rather than guaranteed success, a nuance not explicit in the source's 'ils sauvoient' (they accounted for/saved).","The translator elaborates on the source's 'de bons avis' (good advice) by specifying that the advice would have been about 'how to have fram'd it better,' making the King's criticism more concrete.","The phrase 'he would have given the Almighty' specifies the recipient of the King's advice using a particular term for God ('the Almighty') and re-emphasizes the act of giving advice, making the King's hypothetical critique of creation more direct and vivid than the source's more indirect phrasing.","The source states the crystal heaven 'imprimoit ce mouvement' (imparted/gave motion). The target expands this to 'influence and give Motion,' adding the concept of 'influence,' which subtly broadens the described role of the crystal heaven.","This phrase is added as a direct and concise response ('nothing so well;') to the Countess's preceding question ('would nothing else serve as well?'), making the dialogue more interactive before the narrator proceeds to the full explanation.","This phrase is added to frame the following statement about comets, perhaps to indicate it's a generally accepted observation, a development in understanding, or to lend a slightly less assertive tone to the observation.","The translator specifies 'the Philosophers' as those whose beliefs ('croyoit autrefois' - was formerly believed) were challenged by the comets and uses 'expected,' which adds a nuance of anticipation and specific agency not present in the more general French phrasing.","This is a substantial addition. 'But to make the best of a bad Market' is a colloquial idiom adding color. 'they presently melt down their broken Glass' vividly describes the action based on the 'crystal heavens' breaking. 'and to Aristotles Confusion' adds a dramatic, almost gleeful, commentary on the downfall of Aristotelian physics, none of which is in the source's simpler statement about resolving to make the heavens fluid.","This clause is added to explicitly clarify what the new observations about Venus and Mercury disprove about the ancient system, by stating 'and not round the Earth' and directly linking this error to 'according to the Antient Systeme.'","This is a significant addition that strongly emphasizes the complete rejection of the ancient system ('every where exploded') and contemptuously dismisses ancient authorities ('all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush'), reflecting a more strident pro-modern science stance than the source's 'absolument insoûtenable' (absolutely untenable).","This phrase personifies Nature with a culturally specific and vivid image ('a great Huswife') to explain her thriftiness ('épargne extraordinaire'), making the concept more relatable and colorful for the target audience.","This phrase is added at the beginning of the philosopher's speech to reassure the Marquise ('Fear it not, Madam,'), enhancing the conversational and personal tone of the dialogue.","The adjective 'beloved' is added to 'Circles of Antiquity,' introducing an emotional or ironic layer. It suggests these ancient concepts were cherished, making their destruction by Copernicus seem more dramatic or poignant.","The simile 'like so many Glass Windows' is added by the translator to make Copernicus's destruction of the 'Crystal Heavens' (source: 'Cieux solides') more graphic, vivid, and relatable for the reader.","The addition of 'so gloriously' intensifies the description of Earth's former 'heavenly Equipage,' emphasizing its splendor and heightening the contrast with its new, humbler status in the Copernican system.","This colloquial English phrase 'I fancy' is a characteristic addition by this translator, making the Countess's speech more personal and conjectural when observing the narrator's enthusiasm.","The translator has the Countess cleverly echo the narrator's earlier phrase ('noble fureur d'Astronome' / 'noble Rage of Astronomy') used for Copernicus, applying it ('Noble Fury of Astronomy') to the narrator himself. This adds a layer of playful irony and thematic connection not explicitly in the source's simpler 'un enthousiasme...si pompeusement'.","This phrase replaces the Countess's simple statement of not understanding ('que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës') with a polite request for a change in the narrator's delivery style ('a little less Rapture') and an optimistic outlook on future comprehension ('and I shall understand you the better'), making her intervention more constructive and conversational.","The phrase 'You say' is added by the Countess when she reiterates the narrator's point about the Sun's position, attributing the statement back to him and emphasizing she is recalling his explanation.","The interjection 'nay' adds emphasis, and 'I fear' introduces the Countess's personal apprehension or suspicion regarding Copernicus's intentions towards the Moon. This changes the tone from the source's direct challenge ('Avoüez que' - Admit that) to a more subjective expression of concern.","The translator specifies the general 'on' (one/people) from the source as 'a Fair Lady,' tailoring the example about vanity to the presumed interests of the Marquise and making it more concrete and culturally specific for the target audience.","The translator changes the general setting 'dans une chambre' (in a room, implying a social gathering) to the more specific and culturally resonant 'at a Ball,' making the comparison about social precedence more vivid for English readers of the period.","The translator shifts from the impersonal 'on veut' (one wants) in the source to a direct address 'if you love the uppermost place in the one,' personalizing the example of seeking high status and connecting it to the earlier 'Fair Lady at a Ball' image, thereby making the argument more engaging.","This phrase ('I know not, said I, but I am sure') is added by the narrator to directly respond to the Marquise's preceding skeptical question about the acceptance of Copernicus's system. He admits ignorance on one aspect before pivoting to what he is certain about regarding Copernicus's own doubts.","The addition of 'again is your' (for 'C'est-là le rivage' - That is the shore) serves to reinforce the narrator's argument to the Countess about the changing 'shore' (the fixed stars) and personalizes the metaphor ('your Shoar') for her, making the explanation more direct and engaging."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs.</span></span> Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">&amp; parlons du Soleil.</span></span></span></span> J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an</span></span>, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il?

Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination?

Tell not me, said she, of Lovers and Adorers, I am for my beloved Sun and Planets. But how comes it to pass that the Sun as to the fixed Stars compleats his course but in a year, and yet goes over our Heads every day? Did you never, I reply'd, observe a Bowl on a Bowling-green? It runs towards the Block, and at the same time turns very often round it self, so that the Parts which were above are below, and those which were below are above; just so it is with the Earth, at the same time that she advanceth on the Circle which in a years space she makes round the Sun, in twenty four hours she turns round her self; so that in twenty four hours every part of the Earth loseth the Sun, and recovers him again, and as it turns towards the Sun, it seems to rise, and as it turns from him, it seems to fall. It is very pleasant, said she, that the Earth must take all upon her self, and the Sun do nothing. And when the Moon, the other Planets, and the fix'd Stars seem to go over our Heads every twenty four hours, you'll say that too is only Fancy? Pure Fancy, said I, which proceeds from the same cause, for the Planets compleat their courses round the Sun at unequal times, according to their unequal distances, and that which we see to day answer to a certain Point in the Zodiack or Circle of the fix'd Stars, to morrow we see answer to another Point, because it is advanced on its own Circle as well as we are advanced upon ours. We move, and the Planets move too, which must make a great alteration; so that what seems irregular in the Planets, proceeds only from our motion, when in truth they are all very regular: I will suppose 'em so, said the Countess, but I would not have their Regularity put the Earth to so great trouble; methinks you exact too much Activity from so ponderous a Mass. But, said I, had you rather that the Sun and all the Stars, which are vast great Bodies, should in twenty four hours travel such an infinity of Miles, and make so prodigious a Tour as they needs must, if the Earth did not turn round it self every twenty four hours? Oh, said she, the Sun and the Stars are all Fire, their Motion is not very difficult; but the Earth, I fancy, is a little unweildy: That signifies nothing, I reply'd, for what do you think of a first rate Ship, which carries near an hundred Guns, and a thousand Men, beside her Provisions and other Furniture? you see one puff of Wind makes it sail on the Water, because the Water is liquid, and being easily separated doth very little resist the motion of the Ship: So the Earth tho' never so Massive is as easily born up by the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water, and fills all that great Space where the Planets float; for where would you the Earth should be fastned to resist the motion of the Celestial Matter, and not be driven by it? You may as well fancy a little block of Wood can withstand the current of a River. But pray, said she, how can the Earth with all its weight be born up by your Celestial Matter, which must be very light, because it is so fluid? It doth not argue, said I, that what is most fluid is most light: for what think you of the great Vessel I mention'd but now, which with all its Burthen is yet lighter than the Water it floats on? I will have nothing to do with that great Vessel, said she, and I begin to apprehend my self in some danger on such a whirlegigg as you have made of the Earth: There is no danger, I reply'd; but Madam, if you are afraid, we will have the Earth supported by four Elephants, as the Indians believe it. Hey day, cry'd she, here's another Systeme; however I love those People for taking care of themselves, they have a good Foundation to trust to, while you Copernicans are a little too venturous with the Celestial Matter; and yet I fancy if the Indians thought the Earth in the least danger of sinking, they would double their number of Elephants. They do well, said I, laughing at her fancy, who would sleep in Fear? and if you have occasion for 'em to night, we will put as many as you please in our Systeme, we can take 'em away again by degrees as you grow better confirm'd. I do not think 'em very necessary, said she, I have courage enough to turn. You shall turn with pleasure, Madam, said I, and shall find delightful Ideas in this Systeme. For Example, sometimes I fancy my self suspended in the Air, without any motion, while the Earth turns round me in twenty four hours; I see I know not how many different Faces pass under me, some white, some black, and some tauny; sometimes I see Hats, and sometimes Turbants, now Heads with Hair, and then shav'd Heads; here I see Cities with Steeples, others with Spires and Crescents, others with Towers of Purcelain, and anon great Countreys with nothing but Cottages; here. I see vast Oceans, and there most horrible Desarts; in short, I discover the infinite variety which is upon the surface of the Earth.

The translator replaces the French locations 'Paris & Saint-Denis' with 'London and Greenwich' (London and its then-separate nearby town) to make the analogy more immediate and relevant for the English-speaking audience of the time.","Cultural adaptation and specification. 'a Cockney,' a term for a specific type of Londoner, is used instead of the more general 'un Bourgeois de Paris' (a citizen of Paris), thereby creating a more concrete and culturally resonant character for English readers.","Specificity and cultural adaptation. The phrase 'who was never beyond the Walls of London' replaces the more general 'qui ne sera jamais sorty de sa Ville' (who has never left his city). This provides a concrete historical and geographical image tied to London, aligning with other cultural substitutions for an English audience.","Cultural adaptation. The Parisian landmark 'sur les Tours de Notre Dame' (on the Towers of Notre Dame) is replaced with 'from the top of the Pyramid' (likely The Monument in London), a high vantage point familiar to Londoners, to maintain the analogy's local relevance for English readers.","Cultural elaboration and specification. This phrase, which idiomatically defines a Cockney, is added to the description of the untraveled city dweller. It further grounds the analogy in London culture by providing a well-known localizing detail that has no direct equivalent in the source's simpler 'qui n'est jamais sorty de sa Ville' (who has never left his city).","Clarification. The source's pronoun 'nous' (us) in 'vous nous faites tort' (you do us wrong) is ambiguous. The translator adds 'upon your Fellow-Citizens' to specify that the Marquise feels the philosopher is being unjust to her peers (likely Parisians or the French in general), making her objection more explicit.","Elaboration. The source phrase 'je vous vois un air de confiance qui me fait déjà peur.' (I see in you an air of confidence that already scares me.) implies a reluctant yielding. The addition 'whether I will or no.' makes this sense of being persuaded or compelled against one's initial inclination more explicit.","Added polite/ironic commentary. This phrase is an additional remark by the narrator that is not present in the source sentence. It injects a light, courtly, or perhaps slightly teasing tone into his observation about the Marquise's partiality for the Moon.","Discourse marker addition. The translator introduces the scientific explanation about the nature of light with the phrase 'but you must know that'. This common English introductory phrase is not in the source and likely serves to engage the reader more directly or to ensure a smoother transition into the expository passage.","Rhetorical amplification and elaboration. The source states a mild belief ('Or je croy que vous ne contesterez pas...' - Now I believe you will not dispute...). The target transforms this into a much stronger, more philosophical assertion that *not* allowing Earth's solidity would be 'to deny our Senses,' adding a layer of argumentative force and a specific consequence not explicit in the French.","Discourse marker addition. The phrase 'in short,' is added by the translator before summarizing the point about advantageous positioning. It signals a concise restatement or conclusion, enhancing the logical flow of the argument for the English reader.","Specification. The source phrase 'Cela va de la même maniere' (It goes the same way) is general. The addition 'with us all,' clarifies that the Marquise is extending the analogy to apply universally to all people's perceptions of status and appearances.","Elaboration and specification. The French 'l'éclat des Conditions; élevées au-dessus des nôtres' (the brilliance/splendor of conditions elevated above ours) is somewhat abstract. The target's 'Quality and Fortune' provides more concrete examples of what these 'conditions' might entail (referring to social standing and wealth), making the Marquise's comparison more accessible and readily understandable.","Restoration of missing explanation. This substantial passage, detailing the consequences of the Moon's synchronous rotation (why it shows the same face to Earth and how celestial bodies appear to move from the Moon's perspective), is present in the target text but is absent from the provided source text snippet which omits it after 'c'est à dire, en un mois;'.

'Countess' is the added element replacing 'Marquise' within the phrase 'saith the Countess'. This substitution alters the specific noble rank of the character, possibly to make the title more familiar or resonant with an English audience of the period, thus serving cultural relevance.","The French 'une lumiere blanchâtre' translates to 'a whitish light' or 'a pale light'. The translator rendered this as 'pale and weak', adding 'and weak'. This elaboration likely emphasizes the diminished intensity of the reflected light, consistent with the preceding discussion of light losing 'force & de la vivacité' upon reflection, a qualitative descriptor not strictly present in 'blanchâtre'.","The source phrase 'que nous recevons du Soleil' (that we receive from the Sun) is translated as 'which shines directly upon us from the Sun'. The addition of 'directly upon us' provides more specific information about the manner and direction of the sunlight, making the description more vivid and emphatic for the reader.","The source phrase 'qui n'a aucune lumière pour se faire voir' (which has no light to make itself seen/to be seen) is rendered in the target as 'because it hath no Light upon it'. The addition of 'upon it' specifies the location of the absence of light (i.e., on the Moon's surface itself), offering a more concrete image and enhancing clarity.","The source text begins the clause 'C'est alors pour les Gens de la Lune Pleine Terre' ('It is then for the People of the Moon Full Earth'). The target text introduces the corresponding clause with 'so that, as I may say, the People of the Moon have then a full Earth'. The addition of 'so that,' explicitly frames the statement as a consequence or result of the preceding astronomical explanation, strengthening the logical connection for the English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je saurai tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Je vois en gennral que dans la Lune ils ont un mois à rebours du nôtre</span></span>, &amp; je gage que quand nous avons pleine Lune, c'est que toute la moitié lumineuse de la Lune est tournée vers toute la moitié obscure de la Terre; qu'alors ils ne nous voyent point du tout, &amp; qu'ils comtent Nouvelle Terre.

The translator renders this as 'guess at the Folly of the People in the Moon.' By using 'the Folly of,' the translator not only makes the implicit reference explicit but also introduces a more specific and somewhat stronger concept ('Folly') than the original 'ignorance,' thereby elaborating on the source text's meaning for the English reader.","The source phrase 'avec des Lunettes de longue veuë' translates literally to 'with long-view glasses,' meaning telescopes. The English translation 'with their Tubes and Tellescopes' adds 'Tubes and.' In the 17th and 18th centuries, 'tube' was a common, sometimes simpler or more general, term for a telescope. The translator likely added 'Tubes and' to use familiar contemporary English terminology, possibly for emphasis or to suggest a range of viewing instruments, thus elaborating slightly on the singular concept in the French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P033: Vous me surprenez, reprit-elle.

It might serve to connect to a previous, unprovided part of the dialogue or to create a smoother conversational flow by establishing a premise (that previous information was 'exact') for her current inquiry.","The translator replaced the general French 'Messieurs de l'Observatoire' (Gentlemen of the Observatory) with the specific name of John Flamsteed, a prominent English astronomer of the time, and added a descriptive appositive. This cultural substitution makes the reference more concrete and recognizable for the English readership, enhancing its relevance.","The translator expanded the list of geographical features Astolfo observes on the Moon. While the source mentions 'fleuves' (rivers), 'Lacs' (lakes), 'Villes' (cities), and 'Forêts' (forests), the target text adds 'Seas, Mountains,' possibly to make the lunar landscape seem more diverse or grand, or simply as an elaboration for descriptive effect.","The translator inserted 'and in searching for the Philosophers Stone' into the list of lost things found on the Moon. This addition elaborates on the theme of wasted time and effort ('le temps qu'on donne au Jeu' - time spent in play/games), using an example highly resonant and familiar to a 17th-century audience, thereby adding a layer of contemporary cultural relevance.","This extensive passage is entirely an addition by the translator, as the provided source text (P034) concludes with 'les Soûpirs des Amans.' The translator has significantly expanded the dialogue, introducing new conversational turns, reflections on Ariosto's ideas (like the Donation of Constantine and lost wits in vials), and incorporating contemporary English social satire with references to specific types of figures ('my Lord-', 'Sir Tho.', etc.) and societal observations. This large addition serves to further anglicize the text, making it more engaging and satirical for the target audience of late 17th-century England."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune.

Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin.

It appears before the translation of the corresponding French section begins, likely serving as a culturally relevant epigraph or commentary on the theme of 'lost wits' for the English audience.","In the poetic translation of Ariosto's speech (which Fontenelle summarizes in prose), the translator adds the specific detail 'in that fair Hair,' to the list of the beloved's features where the wit wanders. The source mentions only 'eyes' (yeux) and 'mouth' (bouche).","The interjection 'whip,' is added by the translator before 'they are gone into the Moon' to create a more vivid and sudden image of the wits' departure, an effect not present in the simpler French 'il va dans la Lune' (it goes to the Moon).","The translator significantly alters and expands the Marquise's (Countess's) reflection. The source has her suggesting that non-philosophical wits might wander over someone unworthy. The target text replaces this with a more elaborate and cynical remark: 'when 'tis forty to one, but Love fixeth our Wits on an Object we cannot but be asham'd of,' which is entirely new content.","The word 'pray' is added by the translator to the request 'tell me' (source: 'dites-moy'). This addition softens the imperative and adds a conventional English expression of politeness or earnestness.","The translator introduces 'methinks' where the source uses 'car' (for/because). 'Methinks' ('for methinks hitherto you have not been very positive') adds a subjective, personal tone ('it seems to me') to the Marquise's observation, which is presented more as a direct statement in the French.","The phrase 'do but' is added by the translator to the verb 'observe' (source: 'Voyez'). 'Voyez' means 'See' or 'Observe.' The addition of 'do but' acts as an intensifier, making the philosopher's exhortation more emphatic for the English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience?

The translator adds 'so strange a Composition, a Creature' to provide a more concrete and evocative image for the English reader, elaborating on the nature of this hypothetical being referenced by 'quelque chose'.","The French 'sur les plus importantes' (on the most important things) is general. The translator specifies this by adding 'of what most concerns him,' personalizing the object of ignorance and making its nature clearer and more impactful for the reader. This addition clarifies the vague 'les plus importantes'.","The translator added 'Well, well' as a conversational interjection at the beginning of the Countess's speech (which follows 'dit la Marquise' in the source). This element is not present in the source text and serves to make the dialogue sound more natural and idiomatic in English.","The source 'ils ne nous devineront pas' means 'they will not guess us' or 'they will not figure us out.' The target text 'they in the Moon know nothing of us' replaces this with a stronger and more absolute assertion. This introduces the concept of a complete lack of knowledge, a proposition not present in the source's idea of failing to guess.","The French 'que nous les pussions deviner' translates to 'that we could guess them' or 'figure them out.' The target phrase 'a little better acquainted with them' (part of 'I could wish we were a little better acquainted with them') introduces the concept of familiarity or direct knowledge. This is an elaboration adding a desire for a different kind of understanding than just 'guessing,' a nuance not in the source.","The French 'comment ils sont faits' refers to 'how they are made' or 'what they are like' (their nature, appearance, constitution). The target phrase 'what is done there.' (part of 'and yet not know what is done there.') shifts the focus. It introduces an inquiry about the actions or activities of the Moon's inhabitants, a category of unknown information different from the source's concern with their intrinsic nature.","The source text questions the Marquise's lack of concern about the inhabitants of the unknown Southern Land. The target text, after conveying this core idea, appends two explicit questions: 'What Creatures inhabit it, and what they do there?'. These questions are an elaboration, adding direct inquiries about the unknown inhabitants and their activities, which are not formulated as explicit questions in the source sentence.","The source text refers to the Moon as 'cet autre Vaisseau' (this other vessel). The translator's addition of the adjective 'great' (in the target phrase 'another great Vessel') is not present in the original French. This addition serves to emphasize the perceived scale or grandeur of the Moon imagined as a vessel.","The source states the Moon-vessel navigates 'loin de nous' (far from us). The translator's addition of 'vast' (in the target phrase 'at a vast distance from us') intensifies the idea of remoteness. This elaborates on the degree of 'far' beyond the simple statement in the original French, emphasizing the great separation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup</span></span>, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant.</span></span> Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute.

Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune.</span></span> Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites.

You would laugh at me, said I, if I should answer you seriously, perhaps I may deserve it, and yet, I fancy, I can say a great deal to justifie a ridiculous thought that is just now come into my Head; nay to use the Fools best Argument, I'll lay a wager I make you own (in spite of Reason) that one of these days there may be a Communication between the Earth and the Moon, and who knows what great Advantages we may procure by it? Do but consider America before it was discover'd by Columbus, how profoundly ignorant were those People, they knew nothing at all of Arts or Sciences, they went naked, had no other Arms but a Bow and Arrows, and did not conceive they might be carry'd by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a wide Space, forbidden to Man, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing: 'Tis true, after having spent whole years in making hollow the trunks of great Trees with sharp stones, they put themselves to Sea in these Trunks, and floated from Land to Land, as the Wind and Waves drove 'em; but how often was their Trough overset, and they forc'd to recover it again by swimming? So that (except when they were on the Land) it might be said they were continually swimming: And yet had any one but told 'em of another kind of Navigation incomparably more perfect and useful than their own, that they might easily pass over that infinite Space of Water, that they might stop in the middle of the Waves, and in some sense command the Winds, and make their Vessel go fast or slow as they pleas'd; in short, that this impassable Ocean should be no obstacle to their conversing with another different People; do you think they would have believed you? and yet at last that day is come; the unheard of and most surprizing Sight appears, vast great Bodies, with white Wings, are seen to fly upon the Sea, to vomit Fire from all Parts, and to cast on their Shoars an unknown People, all scaled with Iron, who dispose and govern Monsters as they please; carry Thunder in their Hands, and overthrow and destroy whoever resists 'em: From whence came they? Who brought 'em over the Sea? Who gave to 'em the Disposal of the Fire of Heaven? Are they Gods? Are they Sons of the Sun? for certainly they are not Men. Do but consider, Madam, the surprize of the Americans, there can be nothing greater; and after this, shall any one say there shall never be a Communication between the Moon and the Earth. Did the Americans believe there would ever be any between them and Europe, till it came to pass? 'Tis true, you must pass this great Space of Air and Heaven which is between the Earth and the Moon; but did not those vast Seas seem at first as impassable to the Americans? You rave, I think, said she, did you not own the Americans were so ignorant, that they had not the least conception of crossing the Sea; but we who know a great deal more then they, can imagine and fancy the going through the Air, tho' we are assur'd it is not to be done. There is somewhat more than Fancy, I reply'd, when it hath been already practis'd, for several have found the secret of fastning Wings, which bear them up in the Air, to move them as they please, and to fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple; I cannot say indeed they have yet made an Eagles Flight, or that it doth not cost now and then a Leg or an Arm to one of these new Birds; but this may serve to represent the first Planks that were launch'd on the Water, and which were the very beginning of Navigation; there were no Vessels then thought of to sail round the World, and yet you see what great Ships are grown by little and little from those first Planks. The Art of Flying is but newly invented, it will improve by degrees, and in time grow perfect; then we may fly as far as the Moon. We do not yet pretend to have discover'd all things, or that what we have discover'd can receive no addition; and therefore, pray let us agree, there are yet many things to be done in the Ages to come. Were you to live a thousand Ages, said the Countess, I can never believe you will fly, but you must endanger your Neck. I will not, I reply'd, be so unmannerly as to contradict a fair Lady, but tho' we cannot learn the Art here, I hope you will allow they may fly better in the Moon; 'tis no great matter whether we go to them, or they come to us, we shall then be the Americans, who knew nothing of Navigation, and yet there were very good Ships at t' other end of the World. Were it so, said she, the People in the Moon would have been here before now. All in good time, said I, the Europians were not in America till at the end of some thousands of years, they were so long in improving Navigation to the point of crossing the Ocean. The People in the Moon have already made some short Voyages in the Air; they are exercising continually, and by degrees will be more expert, then we shall see 'em, and God knows how we shall be surpriz'd. It is unsufferable, said she, you should banter me at this rate, and justifie your ridiculous Fancy by such false reasoning. I am going to demonstrate, said I, you reproach me very unjustly: Consider, Madam, that the World is unfolded by degrees; for the Ancients were very positive, that the Torrid and Frigid Zones were not inhabitable, by reason of their excessive Heat and Cold; and in the time of the Romans, the general Map of the World was but very little extended beyond that of their Empire; which tho' in one sense, express'd much Grandeur, in another sense, was a sign of as great Ignorance; however, there were Men found both in very hot and in very cold Countreys; so that you see the World is already encreas'd after that it was thought that the Ocean cover'd the whole Earth, except what was then discover'd; there was no talk then of the Antipodes, not so much as a thought of 'em, for who could fancy their Heels at top, and their Heads at bottom; and yet after all their fine reasoning, the Antipodes were discover'd; here's now another half of the World starts up, and a new Reformation of the Map; methinks this, Madam, should restrain us, and teach us not to be so positive in our Opinions, the World will unfold it self more to us hereafter; then we shall know the People in the Moon as well as we do now the Antipodes; but all things must be done in order, the whole Earth must be first discover'd, and till we are perfectly acquainted with our own Habitation, we shall never know that of our Neighbours. Without fooling, said the Countess, you are so very profoud in this Point, that I begin to think, you are in earnest, and believe what you say. Not so neither, said I, but I would shew you how easie it is to maintain a chymerical Notion, that may (like some opinions in Religion,) perplex a Man of understanding, but never perswade him; there is nothing perswades but Truth, it hath no need of all its proofs, but enters naturally into our Understanding; and when once we have learn'd it, we do nothing but think of it. I think you then, said she, for imposing on me no longer; for I confess your false reasoning disturb'd me, but now I sha�l sleep very quietly, if you think fit to go home.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P028: Oh, said she, for the Earth, I reckon it all as good as discover'd, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">and can guess at the People, tho' I never heard a word of 'em</span></span>; for certainly they all resemble us very much, and we may know 'em better when we have a mind to't; they will stay where they are, and 'tis no more but going to see 'em; but we cannot get into the Moon if we would, so that I despair <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">of knowing what they do there</span></span>.

Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voilà le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point.

Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle</span></span>, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire.

Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes.

Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature</span></span>, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées.

Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance. Cela nous fournira des fruits, des blés, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons.

I cannot suffer it, said she; yesterday you were preparing me to receive a Visit from 'em, and now there are no such People in Nature: Once you would have me believe the Moon was inhabited; I surmounted the Difficulty I had, and will now believe it. You are a little too nimble, I reply'd; did I not advise you never to be entirely convinc'd in things of this nature, but to reserve half of your understanding free and disengag'd, that you may admit of the contrary opinion, if there be any occasion. I care not for your Sentences, said she, let us come to matter of Fact. Are we not to consider the Moon as Greenwhich? No, said I, the Moon doth not so much resemble the Earth, as Greenwich doth London: The Sun draws from the Earth and Water, Exhalations and Vapours, which mounting to a certain height in the Air, do there assemble, and form the Clouds; these uncertain Clouds are driven irregularly round the Globe, sometimes shadowing one Countrey, and sometimes another; he then who beholds the Earth from a-far off, will see frequent alterations upon its surface, because a great Country overcast with Clouds, will appear dark or light, as the Clouds stay, or pass over it; he will see the Spots on the Earth often change their Place, and appear, or disappear as the Clouds remove; but we see none of these changes wrought upon the Moon, which would certainly be the same, were there but Clouds about her; but on the contrary, all her Spots are fix'd and certain, and her light parts continue where they were at first, which truly is a great misfortune; for by this reason, the Sun draws no Exhalations or Vapours above the Moon; so that it appears she is a Body infinitely more hard, and solid than the Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upwards as soon as Heat puts them in Motion: But it must be a heap of Rock and Marble, where there is no Evaporation; besides, Exhalations are so natural and necessary where there is Water, that there can be no Water at all, where there is no Exhalation; and what sort of Inhabitants must those be, whose Countrey affords no Water, is all Rock, and produceth nothing? Very fine, said she, you have forgot since, you assur'd me, we might from hence distinguish Seas in the Moon; nay, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">You or your Friends were Godfathers to some of 'em.

But will this suffice then, said she, to extirpate the People in the Moon? Not altogether, I reply'd, we will neither determine for, nor against them. I must own my weakness (if it be one) said she, I cannot be so perfectly undetermin'd as you would have me to be, but must believe one way, or the other; therefore pray fix me quickly in my opinion; as to the Inhabitants of the Moon; preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit; and yet methinks I have a strange inclination for 'em, and would not have 'em destroy'd, if it were possible to save 'em. You know, Madam, said I, I can deny you nothing; the Moon shall be no longer a Defart, but to do you service, we will repeople her. Since to all appearance, the Spots in the Moon do not change, I cannot conceive there are any Clouds about her, that sometimes obscure one part, and sometimes another; yet this doth not hinder, but that the Moon sends forth Exhalations, and Vapours. Our Clouds which we see in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their coming out of the Earth, were separated into such minute Particles, that they could not be discern'd; but as they ascend higher, they are condens'd by the Cold, and by the re- union of their Parts, are render'd visible; after which they become great Clouds, which fluctuate in the Air, till they return back again in Rain; however these Exhalations and Vapours do sometimes keep themselves so dispers'd, that they are imperceptible; or if they do assemble, it is in forming such subtile Dews, that they cannot be discern'd to fall from any Cloud. It may likewise happen, that the Vapours which go out of the Moon (for it is incredible that the Moon is such a Mass, that all its Parts are of an equal Solidity, all at rest one with another, and all incapable of any alteration from the efficacy of the Sun; I am sure we are yet unacquainted with such a Body: Marble it self is of another Nature, and even that which is most Solid, is subject to Change and Alteration; either from the secret and invisible motion it hath within it self, or from that which it receives from without) it may so happen then, that the Vapours which issue from the Moon, may not assemble round her in Clouds, and may not fall back again in Rain, but only in Dews. It is sufficient for this, that the Air with which the Moon is environ'd, (for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth) be a little different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon a little different from those of the Earth, which is very probable. Hereupon the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than on the Earth, the Effects must be different; tho' it is of no great consequence whether they are or no; for from the moment we have found an inward motion in the parts of the Moon, or produced by foreign Causes, here is enough for the new birth of its Inhabitants, and a sufficient and necessary fund for their Subsistence.

The target text 'cannot stay half so long in it' specifies the nature of the short duration, and the entirely new comparison 'as one of the worst of Sir Harry Blount's Sponge-gatherers' adds a culturally specific and vivid illustration to make the point more concrete and relatable for the English audience of the time.","The translator added 'and alter' to the verb 'change' (from the source 'change'), creating a doublet 'change and alter'. This was a common rhetorical device in English of the period, likely used for emphasis or stylistic variation, and is not present in the source text.","The translator added the word 'Philosophers' to specify the 'Quelques Modernes' (Some Moderns) mentioned in the source. This addition provides clarity and context for the English reader by identifying the group being referred to, an explicit detail not in the original French.","The translator added 'to us' in the phrase 'therefore to us it appears blue.' The French source 'il paraît bleu' (it appears blue) does not explicitly state for whom. This addition clarifies the observer's perspective, making it explicit for the reader.","The French 'des Genies corporels' (corporeal spirits/geniuses) is rendered as 'our Faries, whom they alow to be Corporeal'. The added clause 'whom they alow [assert/acknowledge] to be' elaborates on the simple adjective 'corporels' by explaining that their corporeality is an attribute ascribed to them by believers, adding a layer of interpretation not directly in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy.

'Petticoat' specifies a type of female garment, and 'a suit of Knots' (fashionable ribbon trimmings of the era) substitutes a contemporary fashion accessory for 'furniture'. This addition tailors both examples to feminine fashion, enhancing vividness and cultural relevance for the Marquise's comparison for the English audience.","The translator added 'as Mrs. Harrison', likely a contemporary cultural reference to a person known for good taste or 'Fancy' (a term of the period for ingenuity or taste). This addition makes the philosopher's abstract praise of Nature's ingenuity ('esprit') more concrete and relatable for the English audience by comparing it to a human exemplar.","The translator added 'nay,' as an emphatic discourse marker. While 'Il me paroît' (it seems to me/I think) is translated by 'I am of opinion,' the addition of 'nay,' serves to introduce the Countess's opinion with greater emphasis or as a stronger assertion than the French phrasing might suggest. It's a rhetorical addition to enhance the flow or persuasive force in English.","The French 'd'imagination à imagination' (from imagination to imagination) is an abstract formulation. The translator has rendered this as 'between one Man's Fancy and anothers,' which personalizes and concretizes the idea. By specifying 'one Man's... and anothers,' the translator adds an element of individual human perspective and possession of 'Fancy' (imagination), making the concept more direct and perhaps more readily understood by the English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, répliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mêmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.</span></span> Peut-être ne connaissent-ils point en ce Pays-là l'Aurore, ny les Crepuscules, avant che le Soleil se leve, ou après qu'il est couché.

Tho' I fancy 'tis for this reason that Nature hath made great Cavities in the Moon; we can discern 'em easily with our Tellescopes, for they are not Mountains, but so many Wells or Vaults in the middle of a Plain; and what do we know but the Inhabitants of the Moon, being continually broil'd by the excessive heat of the Sun, do retire into those great Wells; perhaps they live no where else, and 'tis there they build 'em Cities; for we still see in the Ruines of old Rome, that that part of the City which was under ground, was almost as large as that which was above ground. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">I fancy, during the late siege of Buda, they liv'd there as they do in the Moon, or 'tis but going to the Fountain Tavern Cellar, where the several Vaults are as so many high Streets, the Vats, Pipes, Hogsheads, so many different Edifices, and the Drawers and Coopers, like so many Troglodites.</span></span> I perceive you laugh at me, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">yet if I may be so free with a fair Lady, you deserve it much better than I;</span></span> for you believe the People in the Moon must live upon the surface of their Planet, because we do so upon ours; but quite contrary, since we dwell upon the Superficies of our Planet, they should not dwell upon the superficies of their Planet; if things differ so much in this World, what must they do in another?</p>","explanations":["The translator significantly expands the Marquise's brief comment about 'comparisons.' The source phrase expresses that she wouldn't miss earthly things for comparison. The target text transforms this into an assertion about Moon inhabitants' skill at making similes, adding a list of earthly items (Pearls, Rubies, Roses, Lillies not mentioned in this context in source) and contemporary English cultural references (Covent-Garden, Visor-Mask, Puppet Show) to provide vivid examples. This addition makes the dialogue more culturally specific and potentially humorous for the English audience of the late 17th/early 18th century.","The translator replaces Fontenelle's more general elaboration on the idea of underground cities on the Moon (which involved imagining removing Rome's surface and people living in interconnected wells) with highly specific and contemporary analogies. The references to the 'late siege of Buda' and the detailed description of the 'Fountain Tavern Cellar' serve to make the speculative concept more concrete and relatable for an English readership through cultural normalization, using examples that would have been current and familiar at the time of translation.","The translator alters the philosopher's response to the Marquise's laughter. In the source, the philosopher agrees she's laughing at his vision and states he will now speak seriously ('j'y consens de tout mon cœur; cependant, à vous parler tres serieusement,'). The English version replaces this with a polite, gallant interjection ('if I may be so free with a fair Lady') and a playful retort ('you deserve it much better than I'). This addition changes the tone from earnest preparation for a serious point to a more bantering, suave exchange, possibly to better suit English conversational styles of the period or to enhance the philosopher's character with a touch of wit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle.

This extensive section, including the explicit 'and return to the Countess,' which frames it as a digression, is entirely absent in the source text. It likely serves to engage the English reader with a curious story or to provide a more conversational and perhaps culturally resonant opening before addressing the Countess's dreams.","The source text states 'Les songes ne furent point heureux: ils representerent toûjours quelque chose qui ressembloit à ce que l'on voit iciy' (The dreams were not successful/happy: they always represented something that resembled what one sees here). The target text replaces this description with 'who either did not dream at all, or nothing to the purpose;'. The specific proposition 'either did not dream at all' is an addition, as the source implies dreams did occur ('ils representerent'). The phrase 'nothing to the purpose' is a concise, interpretative summary of the source's more detailed reason for the dreams' lack of success. This entire clause represents a significant alteration and addition by the translator.","The source text states 'la Terre de dedans Venus paroît' (the Earth from within Venus appears / the Earth viewed from Venus appears). The translator adds '(to them in Venus)' to explicitly clarify that the observers perceiving Earth from Venus are its hypothetical inhabitants. This addition enhances clarity for the target audience by specifying the perspective.","The source text states 'elle paroît dedans Venus' (it [the Moon] appears from within Venus). Similar to the previous instance, the translator adds 'to the Inhabitants of Venus' to make explicit who the observers are. This provides consistency with the earlier clarification regarding Earth's appearance and ensures the reader understands who is perceiving the Moon's magnitude from Venus."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Vous m'affligez, dit la Marquise.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Je voy bien que la Terre n'est pas pour Vénus l'Etoile du Berger, &amp; la Mere des Amours, comme Vénus l'est pour la Terre; car la Terre de dedans Vénus paroît trop grande,</span></span> mais la Lune qui y paroît de la même grandeur dont Vénus nous paroît d'icy, est justement taillée comme il faut pour y être Mere des Amours, &amp; Etoile du Berger. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Ces noms ne peuvent convenir qu'à une Planete qui soit jolie, claire, brillante, &amp; qui ait un air galant.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">C'est asseurément une destinée agréable pour notre Lune que de presider aux Amours des Habitans de Vénus; ces Gens là doivent nien entendre la galanterie.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Oh! sans doute, répondis-je, le menu Peuple de Vénus n'est composé que de Celadons &amp; de Silvandres, &amp; leurs Conversations le plus communes valent les plus belles de Clesie.</span></span></span></span></span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Le climat est très favorable aux Amours. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Vénus est plus proche que nous du Soleil, &amp; elle en reçoit une lumiere plus vive &amp; plus de chaleur.</span></span></span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P046: I see then, says the Countess, that the Earth is not to Venus, what Venus is to the Earth; I mean, that the Earth is too bigg to be the Mother of Love, or the Shepherd's Star to Venus; but the Moon, which appears to Venus, of the same bigness that Venus appears to us, is assign'd to be the Mother of Love, and Shepherds Star to Venus; for such names are only proper for a little brisk airy Planet, bright, and shining as the Goddess her self.

This alters the character's immediate reaction, possibly to make her seem more intellectually reflective.","The translator inserted 'I mean,' as an explanatory discourse marker before the Countess clarifies why Earth is too big to be Venus's 'Mother of Love', enhancing conversational flow and clarity for the English reader.","The translator added 'as the Goddess her self' to explicitly link the planet's described attributes to its namesake, the goddess Venus, thereby enriching the mythological allusion and providing immediate cultural context for an audience familiar with classical mythology.","This extensive addition significantly expands the Countess's original lines. The translator introduces an apostrophe ('Oh, blessed Moon...') and a lengthy satirical comparison between the supposed refined gallantry of Venusians and the perceived coarseness of English manners and courtship ('from the dross of our Wits...'). This adds substantial cultural commentary and humor specific to the English Restoration context, transforming a simple statement about Venusian gallantry into a social critique.","This phrase is added by the translator as the philosopher's initial reaction to the Countess's preceding (largely added) critical remarks about English society. It serves as a polite moderating comment and a bridge to the philosopher's subsequent arguments, which are also heavily expanded by the translator, thus maintaining conversational coherence.","This substantial passage is an addition by the translator, offering a defense or contextualization of English courtship manners within the philosopher's speech. It employs contemporary English social types ('Beaux,' 'Belles'), a witty comparison to modern warfare, and a satirical dismissal of outdated romantic poetic conventions. This injects Restoration-era wit and social commentary, anglicizing the dialogue significantly for the target audience.","While the source mentions French literary examples of refinement ('Celadons,' 'Silvandres,' 'Clesie'), the translator extensively adapts and expands this for an English audience. The addition of 'Parthenissa' (an English romance character), the comparison to 'Grooms and Chamber Maids,' and the reference to 'every Porter and Car-Man a perfect Sir Courtly' (a contemporary English dramatic character) serve to anglicize and vividly illustrate the concept of extreme Venusian refinement using culturally resonant examples.","This is an added transitional phrase ('but then consider') by the translator. It serves to smoothly pivot the conversation back to the original point about the influence of climate after the lengthy interpolated discussions on courtship and manners, ensuring logical progression in the dialogue.","The source specifies Venus receiving 'une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur' (brighter light and more heat). The target's phrase 'a more vigorous and active influence' is a more abstract and interpretative addition, broadening the specific physical effects of light and heat to a more general 'influence,' which could imply vital or even subtle astrological forces, thereby subtly altering the nuance of the scientific explanation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, interrompit la Marquise, comment sont faits les Habitans de Vénus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Ils ressemblent aux Mores Grenadins</span></span>; un petit Peuple noir, brûlé du Soleil, plein d'esprit &amp; de feu, toûjours amoureux, faisant des Vers, aimant la Musique, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">inventant tous les jours des Fêtes, des Danses, &amp; des Tournois.</span></span> Permettez-moy de vous dire, Madame, répliquai-je, que vous ne connaissez guère bien les Habitans de Vénus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Nos Mores Grenadins</span></span></span></span> n'auroient été auprés d'eux que des Lappons &amp; des Groënlandois pour la froideur &amp; pour la stupidité.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P047: I find, says the Countess, it is easie enough to guess at the Inhabitants of Venus; they resemble what I have read of the Moors of Granada, who were a little black People, scorch'd with the Sun, witty, full of Fire, very Amorous, much inclin'd to Musick and Poetry, and ever inventing Masques and Turnaments in honour of their Mistresses.

The addition of \"do you think then\" makes the request for the philosopher's opinion more explicit and conversationally natural in English, with \"then\" serving as a discourse connector.","The translator adds \"so full of Fire,\" when describing the inhabitants of Mercury. The source states \"il faut qu'ils soient fous à force de vivacité\" (they must be mad from sheer vivacity/liveliness). The addition \"so full of Fire,\" elaborates on \"vivacité\" by providing a more vivid and explicit cause (fiery temperament) for their madness, a common association for things related to the Sun.","The translator adds \"vast and\" to the description of light. The source says \"Il leur envoie une lumière si forte\" (It sends them such a strong light). The target renders this as \"it sends them so vast and strong a light\". The word \"vast\" is an addition that intensifies the description of the light's quantity or extent beyond just its strength.","The translator adds \"declining\" to describe the twilight on Mercury. The source text states \"de très foibles Crepuscules\" (very faint twilights). The target text's \"a declining Page 97 twilight\" uses \"declining\" to specify a type or process of twilight (fading, likely evening), an attribute not explicitly present in the source's \"très foibles\" (very faint).","The translator adds the phrase \"(as it were)\" when describing Mercury's visibility. The source says Mercury \"est presque toûjours perdu\" (is almost always lost) in the Sun's rays. The target translates this as \"it is, (as it were) lost in his Rays\". The addition of \"(as it were)\" softens the statement, introducing a figurative or qualifying nuance to the idea of Mercury being 'lost'.","The translator adds \"vast\" to the description of the Sun as seen from Mercury. The source describes the Sun as \"un grand poële ardent\" (a large burning stove/pan). The target text describes it as \"a vast fiery Furnace\". While \"grand\" means large, the addition of \"vast\" significantly amplifies the scale, suggesting immense size for the English reader.","The translator adds \"in Mercury\" for clarity. The source says, referring to other planets, \"ils les voyent plus petites que nous ne les voyons\" (they see them smaller than we see them).

This is a common practice of 'doublet' translation, used for emphasis, clarification, or to provide a more familiar or evocative term for the English audience.","This phrase introduces a new detail about the light changing ('receives several alterations') during its transit between planets, a proposition not present in the source text, which only states that planets send light to each other after receiving it from the sun.","The French text uses 'pour ainsi dire' earlier in a different context ('Elles ne peuvent faire, pour ainsi dire, des échanges entre elles').

It adds the elements of 'often,' 'better heads,' and the personal, self-deprecating 'than mine,' all of which are new propositions not found in the original, making the text more conversational.","The source states 'On avoit toûjours crû... mais on s'en desabusa' (One had always believed... but one was disabused of it). The target phrase 'and that Opinion passed currant' is an addition that elaborates on the prior widespread acceptance and authority of the belief before its refutation, providing extra contextual detail not explicitly stated in the concise French.","The source text uses 'peut-être il y auroit eu querelle' (perhaps there would have been a quarrel), indicating possibility.

This provides an additional keyword familiar to the English-speaking audience of the time, enhancing comprehension by linking to existing scientific terminology.","The French 'Achevez de me rendre folle' (Finish making me mad/crazy) is significantly expanded into the more dramatic question 'or must I become a perfect Fool to understand the misteries of Philosophy?'. This addition explicitly links the idea of 'going mad' to the effort of understanding philosophy, making the Marquise's statement more elaborate and perhaps more emphatic for an English audience.","This entire sentence in the target text is an addition that replaces the original French sentence. The source sentence is an observation by the narrator about the Marquise's enthusiasm ('I didn't know you had such outbursts...it's a shame they only have whirlpools as their object.'). The target sentence offers a direct, encouraging response from the narrator ('I will...and you shall see the Whirlpools are worthy of these transports:'), changing the dynamic of the dialogue.","Similar to the first instance, 'or Vortex' is added after 'Whirlpool' (translating 'Tourbillon') as a synonymous term to ensure the reader connects with the concept using familiar terminology from English scientific discourse of the period.","The French 'Tourbillon de vent' translates to 'Whirlwind'. The translator adds 'Vortex of Wind, or' before 'Whirlwind' to consistently use the term 'Vortex' and explicitly link it to the more common English term 'Whirlwind', reinforcing the equivalence for the reader.","The French 'grand amas de matiere celeste' (great mass of celestial matter) is translated as 'great Mass, or Ocean of Celestial Matter'. The addition of 'or Ocean' provides a more vivid and expansive metaphor, potentially making the abstract concept more accessible or engaging for the reader.","The French 'plus ou moins éloignées' means 'more or less distant/far'. The target 'farther or nearer' already conveys this. The addition of 'in distance' explicitly includes the noun, possibly for emphasis or to ensure complete clarity of the concept of spatial separation, normalizing the expression for the target language conventions of the time.","The source states that if the Earth were in the Sun's place, it would turn on itself ('tourner sur elle- même'). The target adds the comparative phrase 'as the Sun does', which explicitly clarifies that this hypothetical rotation would be similar to the Sun's actual rotation (mentioned just prior), thereby reinforcing the analogy for the reader.","The French 'proches de luy' means 'close to him/it'. The target text elaborates this into 'within the Sphere of his Activity'. This phrase adds the contextual detail of being within Jupiter's range of influence, not just physical proximity, thus providing a clearer explanation for why such closeness would lead to subjugation.","The French 'qui est dans la nôtre' means 'which is in ours' (referring to being in Earth's dependency or vortex). The target translates this as 'to wait on us', an idiomatic expression which adds a nuance of service or attendance, personifying the Moon's relationship to Earth in a way that elaborates on the simple possessive nature of the original.","The source 'toute la fortune qu'on doit avoir' translates to 'all the fortune one is to have'. The target text specifies this as 'all our good Fortune'. The addition of 'good' qualifies the type of fortune, adding a positive connotation that clarifies the contrast being made with a less desirable fate."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P066: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise,</span></span> que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes?

This word is not present in the French source ('Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise,'). 'Pray' is an English discourse marker used here to make the question sound more colloquial, perhaps more urgent or pleading, which normalizes the speech for an English audience of the period.","The translator added 'so ambitious' to describe Jupiter's potential action ('or he so ambitious as to approach us'). The source text describes Jupiter generally as 'entreprenante' (enterprising/daring) earlier in the sentence, but for the specific action of approaching Earth ('ou qu'il ne vienne vers nous pour nous absorber'), it does not explicitly state 'ambitious'. This addition elaborates on Jupiter's motivation for this hypothetical action, adding a specific characteristic not directly present in this part of the source.","The translator added 'in this particular, Madam,' to the philosopher's response ('but in this particular, Madam, we need not hope or fear'). The French source is more concise ('Mais nous n'avons rien à esperer ny à craindre;'). 'In this particular' adds clarification by specifying the context (the preceding discussion about planetary movements).

Jupiter's Year is as much as twelve of ours, so that there must be two opposite extremities in that Planet, where their Night and their Day are six Years each.

A Night six Years long, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">is a little disconsolate</span></span>, and 'tis for that reason, I suppose, they have four Moons; that which (in regard to Jupiter) is uppermost, finisheth its course about him in seventeen days, the second in seven, the third in three days and an half, and the fourth in two and forty hours; and tho' they are so unfortunate as to have six years Night, yet their course being exactly divided into halves, they never pass above one and twenty hours, wherein they do not see at least the last Moon, which is a great comfort in so tedious a darkness; so that be where you will, these four Moons are sometimes the prettiest sight imaginable; sometimes they rise all four together, and then separate according to the inequality of their course; sometimes they are all in their Meridian, rang'd one above another, sometimes you see 'em at equal distances on the Horizon, sometimes when two rise, the other two go down.

This specifies the nature of a previously implied concern or potential threat from Jupiter, making the Countess's relief more vivid for the reader.","The translator replaced the descriptive phrase \"sont bien longues\" (are very long) with the interpretative \"is a little disconsolate\". This adds an emotional dimension to the description of Jupiter's six-year-long nights, elaborating on their impact in a way not explicit in the source's simple statement of length.","The translator added a specific, contemporary English cultural reference concerning George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and his play \"The Rehearsal\", along with a comment on the French origin of dances. This substantial addition, which replaces Fontenelle's original concluding contrast (\"and not of fear, as in this one\"), aims to provide cultural relevance and a familiar, humorous illustration for the English audience of the late 17th century."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P070: Et vous ne manquerez pas, dit la Marquise, à faire habiter ces quatre Lunes, quoy que ce ne foient que de petites Planetes subalternes, destinées seulement à en éclairer une autre pendant ces nuits?

Instead of her original wish (that they always see Jupiter suspended above them), the translator has her express a desire for them 'to be so many Colonies under Jupiter's Government; they should receive their Laws and Customs from him.' This introduces a socio-political dimension entirely absent from the source text's description of her wish, possibly reflecting contemporary English colonial and political thought.","The translator inserts a substantial speech by the philosopher ('I') that has no direct equivalent in the source at this point in the dialogue. This added speech introduces new themes of political representation ('Deputies with Addresses'), the nature of Jupiter's 'command' over its moons (absolute yet imaginary, based on fear), and includes specific astronomical calculations about Jupiter's apparent size and proximity as seen from its moons. This addition significantly expands the dialogue, adding layers of political analogy and scientific-sounding detail not present in the original French.","The source features the Marquise rhetorically asking if the moon inhabitants' lack of fear of eclipses needs to be 'replaced by some other foolishness.' The translator expands this into a more definitive statement by her: 'Every one has their due folly,' and then explicitly articulates the contrasting fears: 'we are afraid of an Eclipse, and they, that Jupiter will fall on their Heads.' This addition provides a concrete elaboration of the 'other foolishness' and makes the comparison more explicit and impactful for the English reader.","The source explains that Tycho Brahe did not fear eclipses 'as the common people fear them' ('comme le Vulgaire les craint'). The translation intensifies this contrast by stating he was unafraid 'when every body else was under the greatest consternation.' This addition heightens the drama of the general reaction to eclipses and emphasizes Brahe's divergent attitude more strongly.","The source says Tycho Brahe would promptly return to shut himself in his home, 'without daring to start the slightest thing.' The translator adds the specific duration 'for that day' to clarify how long Brahe’s self-imposed confinement due to superstition would last. This adds a small temporal detail for increased clarity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit- elle, après que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la</span></span>, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The source describes 'that man' as unable to free himself from an error ('la'). The translation reframes this by suggesting he be left to 'defend his Superstition,' adding a layer of active, potentially stubborn defense and a negative characterization ('Superstition') not present in the source. This addition also serves to curtail a longer philosophical reflection by the Marquise in the source.","The translator changes the source's direct statement ('That's too little, he doesn't see it at all.') into an imperative phrase ('judge you if there be any possibility:') that directly addresses the Countess, inviting her to make the judgment. This adds an interactive element to the dialogue, making it more engaging for the reader.","The source states that the people of Jupiter laugh at the discovery ('n'en fait que rire' - just laugh at it/them). The translator adds 'for Fools' to the phrase 'laugh at 'em for Fools', specifying the implied reason for their laughter and explicitly characterizing the astronomers as foolish in the eyes of the people, a detail not explicitly stated in the source.","The source text uses 'Les Lurieux,' meaning 'the curious ones' or 'those who are curious,' referring to a specific group of people interested in seeing the newly discovered planet.

This introduces a vivid, culturally specific image (musketeers) to embellish the description of telescopes being aimed at each other, likely for an English audience.","The translator inserted \"that is,\" as an explanatory conjunction to clarify the preceding clause (\"they may not know us\") by linking it to a more specific explanation (\"they may not have the least suspicion it is inhabited\"). The source text presents these as two related but separate statements.","The translator added the introductory phrase \"for my part,\" to frame the narrator's belief. While the source \"Cependant je croirois plus volontiers\" (However, I would more willingly believe) conveys a personal opinion, \"for my part,\" adds a common English conversational marker for emphasizing a personal viewpoint.","The translator added \"Sir Francis Drake and\" before \"Columbus\" (which translates \"Colombs\" from the source's \"leurs Christophe Colombs\"). This is a cultural adaptation, including a prominent English explorer to resonate with the target English-speaking audience.","The translator inserted the colloquial interjection \"why, I warrant you,\", which has no equivalent in the source. This addition lends a more informal, emphatic, and conversational tone to the narrator's assertion.","The translator added the parenthetical phrase \"(as it were)\" when describing the inhabitants of Mercury as \"near Neighbours.\" This common English qualifier softens the statement or suggests a figurative interpretation of \"voisins\" (neighbours), a nuance not explicitly present in the source's direct statement \"ils sont tous voisins les uns des autres\" (they are all neighbours to each other).","The translator added \"this I think\" before \"is work enough for their Astronomers.\" The source's \"Voilà assez de Planetes pour embarrasser ceux d'entre eux qui sont Astronomes\" (There are enough planets to perplex those among them who are astronomers) is a more objective statement. The addition makes the narrator's assessment more explicitly subjective and personal.","The translator added \"which I think\" in the phrase \"which I think is very obliging.\" The source expresses a similar idea as a rhetorical question (\"n'est-ce pas là une assez grande faveur?\" - isn't that a rather great favor?). The addition recasts this as a personal opinion of the narrator, making the tone more declarative and subjective.","The translator added the clause \"than Nature design'd it.\" to elaborate on how rendering astronomy more difficult constitutes a punishment. The source states humans are \"punis par les grands travaux que l'Astronomie demande presentement\" (punished by the great labors astronomy presently demands).

The word 'plac'd' is an addition not directly derivable from 'assez élevé' (high enough / elevated) and introduces an element of intentional action (positioning by Nature). This makes Nature's agency in designing this feature more explicit within this descriptive clause, diverging from the source's primary description of a state of being.","The translator elaborated the source phrase 'hors de l'ombre' (out of the shadow / outside the shadow) into 'beyond the reach of the shadow'.

This logical connection (concession/contrast) is only implied by juxtaposition in the source text, and the addition aids flow in English.","The French \"a eu en veüe\" (had in view/considered) is rendered as \"took time to consider.\" The phrase \"took time to\" is an elaboration by the translator, suggesting a more deliberate and careful process by Nature than the original French strictly implies, thus adding a layer of interpretative nuance.","The translator added \"pray,\" to the translation of \"Mais attendez\" (But wait). While \"attendez\" is a direct address, \"pray\" is a common English interjection of the period often used for politeness or to add emphasis when posing a question or making a statement, subtly altering the tone.","The translator transformed the Marquise's declarative realization \"il me semble que Mars... n'a point de Lune\" (it seems to me that Mars... has no Moon) into a direct question \"why has not Mars a Moon too?\". The interrogative word \"why\" and the comparative/emphatic \"too\" are additions that make the dialogue more explicitly inquisitive and probing.","The French \"des Phosphores naturels\" (natural Phosphoruses, or some natural Phosphoruses) is translated as \"so many natural Phosphorus's.\" The addition of \"so many\" serves to emphasize the quantity or the idea that the rocks function as a multitude of individual phosphors, an emphasis not explicitly present in the French indefinite article \"des.\"","The French \"Vous ne sauriez rier que ce ne fût un Spectacle assez agreable\" (You would not deny it would be a rather agreeable spectacle / You couldn't help but find it an agreeable spectacle) is a somewhat indirect rhetorical statement about the listener's presumed reaction. The translator changed this into a direct question and address, \"What think you, Madam,\", making the philosopher's interaction with the Marquise more explicit, personal, and engaging for the reader.","The French phrase \"& faire sans aucun art des illuminations magnifiques\" (and make magnificent illuminations without any artifice/naturally) describes naturally produced, splendid light displays. The translator added the simile \"like so many Illuminations at a Birth day night?\" to provide a concrete and culturally familiar comparison for the English audience of the time, making the description more vivid and relatable.","The source states that the birds \"vont répandre un nouveau jour\" (go to spread a new day).

This directly links her general observation to the specific case of Mars, which is the focus of her subsequent (added) question.","The translator replaced the Marquise's declarative statement of disappointment about Mars with an added rhetorical question ('why should Mars only be excepted?'). This change makes her point more argumentative and direct, enhancing the conversational tone for the English audience.","The translator added the clause 'if ever you intend to make an end' to the advice about leaving some things aside. This addition provides a pragmatic justification for ignoring inconsistencies in philosophical systems, framing it as a necessary step to achieve closure.","The translator added 'if you please' to the philosopher's suggestion 'We will do so by Mars'. This acts as a polite conversational softener, making the suggestion more courteous and aligning with English dialogic conventions.","The translator added the phrase 'but return to Saturn.' after 'and say no more of him.'

This textual addition makes the dialogue more interactive by directly prompting the Marquise, changing the declarative form of the source.","The translator added the specific noun 'Colonies' to the phrase 'I could almost send ... every where'. The source text ('à en envoyer par tout') implies sending people or inhabitants generally. This elaboration specifies the act as 'sending Colonies,' potentially invoking contemporary (17th/18th century) notions of settlement and expansion.","The translator added the clause 'they say Greenland is a perfect Bagnio in comparison of that Planet,' before the statement about Saturn's inhabitants expiring with heat. This introduces an anecdotal framing ('they say') and uses the vivid, culturally specific term 'Bagnio' (a very hot bath-house) to hyperbolically describe Greenland's relative temperature for Saturn's inhabitants.

The English translation alters her response by adding the qualifying clause: \"while it diverts innocently, but no longer.\" This condition, which frames her acceptance of philosophy as a pleasure only if it remains innocent and does not go too far, is entirely new material introduced by the translator, adding a moral or prudential dimension absent in the source.","The translator prepended the conjunction \"for\" to the philosopher's statement about the fixed stars.

This addition subtly moderates the claim, making it sound more natural or less absolute in English.","The source 'Il faut qu'Alexandre ne l'ait pas su' translates more directly to 'Alexander must not have known it' or 'It is necessary that he did not know.' The translator's 'It was not fit' introduces a judgment or a sense of propriety/appropriateness that is not explicitly in the source, subtly shifting the reason why Alexander shouldn't have known.","The source's parenthetical question '(comment une verité eût-elle échappé à Aristote?)' (how could a truth have escaped Aristotle?) is rephrased by the translator into a descriptive clause '(from whom no truth could be long conceal'd)'. The word 'long' is added within this rephrasing, implying a duration of concealment that is not explicitly in the source, thus slightly elaborating on the idea that truth wouldn't escape Aristotle for any significant period.","The source 'qui eût êté au despoir' means 'who would have been in despair.' The translator intensifies this to 'run mad with despair,' adding a layer of psychological extremity ('run mad with') not explicitly present in the original phrase, likely for dramatic effect.","The source 'c'eût eté faire trop mal sa Cour que de luy en parler.' means 'it would have been to pay one's court very badly' or 'it would have been very unpolitic.' The translator renders this as 'a Man would have been a great Fool,' which adds a direct judgment about the person's intelligence ('a great Fool') rather than describing the imprudence of the action itself. This makes the statement more blunt for the target audience.","The translator first renders the sense of 'c'eût eté faire trop mal sa Cour' with 'a Man would have been a great Fool.' Then, they add the clause 'it had been but an ill way of making his court to that ambitious Prince;' This clause serves as an explicit explanation or restatement of the French idiom 'faire mal sa Cour' (to pay court badly/to curry favor ineptly), clarifying its meaning for the English audience. The addition of 'to that ambitious Prince' also provides context for why it would be an ill way to make court.","The source word 'l'inquietude' means anxiety, restlessness, or disquiet. The translator elaborates this single noun into the phrase 'their unquiet restless humour.' The addition of 'humour' (in the older sense of disposition or temperament) and the somewhat redundant but emphatic 'unquiet restless' serves to expand on the concept, making it more vivid for the English reader.","The source 'Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau, voila mon mal,' translates to 'A little weakness for what is beautiful, that's my ailment.' The translator expands the first part by adding the introductory phrase 'I confess, I am guilty of so much weakness, as'. This addition ('I confess, I am guilty of... as') frames the admission more formally and emphatically than the simpler 'Un peu de foiblesse' in the source, and also changes 'a little' (un peu) to 'so much'."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P091: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Cela est hors de doute, répondis-je.</span></span></span></span></span></span> Nôtre Soleil est si proche de nous en comparaison des Soleils des autres Tourbillons, que sa lumiere doit avoir infiniment plus de force sur nos yeux que la leur.

It introduces a lengthy exchange—covering topics like love, the system's truth, reasoning in love versus mathematics, analogical arguments for extraterrestrial life, and the Countess's initial question about the Sun's appearance from other vortices—none of which is present in the supplied source segment. This addition significantly expands the conversational context and narrative before the philosopher's affirmation that corresponds to the start of the French source.","The translator added 'Madam,' a vocative addressing the Countess, into the philosopher's reply. The French 'répondis-je' (I replied) does not contain this direct address. This addition serves to make the dialogue more explicit and adheres to English conversational conventions of the period, adding politeness.","The phrase ', it must be so' is an addition that follows 'Without doubt'. The French 'Cela est hors de doute' (That is beyond doubt) is already conveyed by 'Without doubt.' The addition of 'it must be so' serves to emphatically confirm the statement, possibly for rhetorical weight or to create a more natural English cadence.","The French 'il efface tout' (it erases everything) is expanded into the more descriptive phrase 'it darkens and hinders us from seeing any other light.' This addition clarifies the mechanism by which the Sun's brightness 'erases' other celestial objects from view, making the scientific point more explicit for the reader.","The French 'qui y domine' (which dominates there/in it) is translated using the doublet 'which rules and governs.' This expansion uses two near-synonymous verbs, a common rhetorical practice in older English translations, to add emphasis or fullness to the expression of dominance.","The French 'il efface à son tour le nôtre' (it in turn erases ours [our Sun]) is rendered as 'in its turn, extinguisheth the light of our Sun.' The addition of 'the light of' specifies that it is the visibility or light of our Sun that is 'extinguished,' rather than the Sun itself, providing a more precise astronomical explanation.","The translator adds 'or Sphere' after 'World' when translating 'Dans leur Monde' (In their World). This addition provides an alternative or clarifying term for 'Monde,' possibly to encompass the astronomical concept of a celestial sphere or domain associated with each sun, or to offer a slightly more technical synonym for the target audience.","The French 'ils sont uniques en leur espece' (they are unique in their kind) is translated and elaborated as 'every Sun is single, and there is but one to be seen.' The clause 'and there is but one to be seen' is an addition that makes explicit the consequence of being 'unique' or 'single' in its own vortex—that it is the only sun visible there.","The French phrase 'un fond de ressemblance' (a basis/foundation of resemblance) is rendered in the context of the question as 'tho' they may be alike in one particular.' The addition 'in one particular' specifies and narrows the nature of the 'fond de ressemblance,' making the Countess's philosophical point about similarities versus infinite differences more sharply defined for the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">mais la difficulté est de deviner.</span></span> Que say-je?

The translator added 'to know wherein they differ' to make explicit what needs to be guessed, specifying that the philosopher is trying to determine the ways in which the vortices vary. This provides greater clarity for the reader.","The French 'Planetes subalternes' means 'subordinate planets.' The translator used 'inferiour Planets' and added 'or less' to provide a more common or understandable equivalent for 'inferiour' (which translates 'subalternes'), likely referring to size or significance, thus ensuring clarity for the English audience.","The French 'il n'y en a point' ('there are none at all') is an assertive statement. The translator added 'perhaps' to introduce a degree of speculation or uncertainty that is not present in the original French text, softening the assertion.","The French 'en' is a pronoun referring back to 'Planetes subalternes.' The translator chose to explicitly restate 'inferiour Planets' instead of using a pronoun like 'them' or 'any.' This addition serves to make the reference clearer and more direct for the reader, avoiding potential ambiguity.","The French 'font comme un petit peloton' means 'they are like a small group' or 'they form something like a small group.' The translator uses 'in form of a little Squadron,' where 'in form of a' explicitly specifies that the likeness pertains to the shape or arrangement, an aspect that is more implicit in the simpler French 'comme' (like/as).","The French 'sans Planetes' simply means 'without planets.' The translator added 'at all' after 'without any Planets' to intensify the statement, emphasizing the complete absence of planets for greater rhetorical effect.","The French phrase 'ait un veritable mouvement, & emporte ses Planetes avec soy' means '(the Sun) has a real movement, and carries its Planets with it.' The translator rendered the latter part as 'that Sun may so move, as to carry its Planets along with it.' The phrase 'may so move, as to' adds modality ('may') and a description of manner or consequence ('so move, as to') not explicitly present in the more direct French conjunction, thereby elaborating on how the sun's movement results in carrying the planets.","The French text has 'Enfin, que voudriez-vous? En voila bien assez...' ('Finally, what more would you want? There's quite enough...'). The translator omits the rhetorical question 'Enfin, que voudriez-vous?' and prefaces the translation of 'En voila bien assez...' with 'But I think.' This addition ('But I think') introduces the speaker's explicit thought process and personal judgment into the discourse, framing the subsequent statement."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P093: Ce n'en est guere, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">répondit-elle</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">pour la quantité des Mondes</span></span>.

This addition provides immediate clarity as to who is speaking, potentially for an audience that might prefer explicit identification over pronominal reference.","The translator elaborated the concise French prepositional phrase 'pour la quantité des Mondes' (meaning 'given the quantity of worlds' or 'in view of the quantity of worlds') into the more descriptive English clause 'considering what a multitude of Worlds there are'. This expansion makes the reasoning more explicit and rhetorically stronger, notably through the use of the emphatic 'what a', the explicit verb 'there are', and the choice of 'multitude' over a more neutral term for 'quantité'."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P094: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Que serait-ce donc, repris-je, si je vous disois</span></span> qu'il y a bien d'autres Etoiles Fixes, que celles que vous voyez; qu'avec des Lunettes on en découvre un nombre infiny qui ne se montrent point aux yeux, &amp; que dans une seule Constellation, où l'on en comptoit peut-être douze ou quinze, il s'en trouve autant <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">que l'on en voyait auparavant</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">dans le Ciel</span></span>?</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P074: What, Madam, would you say, if I should tell you, there are many more fix'd Stars than those you see? and that an infinite number are discover'd with Glasses, which never shew'd themselves to our Eyes: In only one Constellation, where it may be, we count twelve or fifteen, there are as many to be found as usually appear in the whole Hemisphere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P074: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">What, Madam, would you say, if I should tell you</span></span>, there are many more fix'd Stars than those you see? and that an infinite number are discover'd with Glasses, which never shew'd themselves to our Eyes: In only one Constellation, where it may be, we count twelve or fifteen, there are as many to be found <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">as usually appear</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">in the whole Hemisphere</span></span>.</p>","explanations":["The translator added 'Madam' as a direct term of address to the Marquise. While the French 'vous' implies formality, 'Madam' makes the address more explicit and aligns with English conventions of politeness in dialogue for the period, enhancing naturalness.","The translator added 'usually' to the phrase. The source 'auparavant' means 'previously' or 'before,' referring to a past observation. The addition of 'usually' shifts this to a habitual or general occurrence, potentially to frame the philosopher's statement as a more established scientific observation rather than a singular past perception.","The translator elaborated 'dans le Ciel' (in the Sky) to 'in the whole Hemisphere'. 'Hemisphere' is a more scientifically precise term for 'Ciel' in an astronomical context, providing clarity. The word 'whole' was added to 'Hemisphere' to emphasize the completeness of this celestial area, making the subsequent comparison more impactful."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P095: Je vous demande grâce, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">s'écria-t-elle</span></span>, je me rends, vous m'accablez de Mondes &amp; de Tourbillons. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Je say bien, ajoûtay-je, ce que je vous garde.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Vous voyez cette blancheur qu'on appelle la Voye de Lait.</span></span> Vous figureriez-vous bien ce que c'est? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Une infinité de petites Etoiles</span></span> invisibles aux yeux à cause de leur petitesse, &amp; semées si prés les unes des autres qu'elles paroissent former une blancheur continuë.

The source 'presque comme des Fossez' (almost like ditches) emphasizes similarity or feasibility rather than explicitly stating ease.","The translator explicates the French indefinite pronoun 'on' (one) as 'the People in one World,' providing a more concrete subject for the action of talking between worlds.","The translator adds 'the light of' to clarify that it is the light of the 'forreign Suns' that is effaced (in 'effaceth the light of all other forreign Suns'), making the astronomical process more explicit than the source's 'efface tous les Soleils étrangers' (effaces all foreign Suns).","The translator changes 'perdez de veuë votre Soleil particulier' (lose sight of your particular Sun) to 'lose the light of your own particular Sun,' explicitly stating that the sun's light is lost, rather than just visual contact.","The translator adds the adjective 'visible' to describe the remaining suns (in 'visible Suns enough'), which are implied by 'en' (them) in the source phrase 'il vous en reste encore assez' (enough of them still remain for you), providing more specific detail about their state.","The translator adds the phrase 'beside your own' (in 'visible Suns enough beside your own') to clarify that the 'enough' remaining suns are in addition to the specific sun that was lost, providing fuller context to the source 'il vous en reste encore assez'.","The translator inserts the clause 'who where they live,' to specify the circumstances or location of the 'miserable sort of People' experiencing nights, adding contextual detail not explicit in the source phrase 'des malheureux qui ont de veritables nuits' (unhappy ones who have real nights).","The translator adds the adverb 'certainly' to the beginning of the sentence, emphasizing the speaker's conviction about the inhabitants' reaction, a modal element not present in the source.","The translator elaborates on 'Etres disgraciez de la Nature' (Beings disgraced by Nature) by rephrasing this concept as the more concrete proposition 'Nature had very little kindness for us,' offering an interpretation of what being 'disgraced by Nature' entails.","The translator adds the clause 'to think what a sad condition we are in' to explain the cause or accompanying cognitive aspect of the 'horrour' felt by the inhabitants.

The addition of `and narrow` (with `strait` being the direct translation of `étroits`) creates an English idiomatic doublet, possibly for emphasis or rhythm, elaborating on the concept of narrowness.","The French introductory phrase `Mais savez-vous bien que` (But are you aware that / But do you know well that) is rendered more emphatically by adding `pray take notice,` in the target `Yet pray take notice, that`. This addition makes the speaker's interjection more direct and prominent for the English reader.","The French `vous me faites naître une veritable difficulté?` (you make me perceive a real difficulty?) is translated as `you have started an objection, not easily answer'd:`. The addition of `, not easily answer'd` elaborates on the `veritable difficulté` (real difficulty), clarifying its nature as something challenging to resolve.","The French sentence `Les Tourbillons sont ronds, n'est-il pas vray?` (The Vortexes are round, isn't it true?) uses a tag question implying an assumption of truth. The English translation recasts this as `and if it be true, that Vortex's are round,`. The phrase `and if it be true,` is an addition that introduces a conditional framing and a conjunction (`and`) not explicitly in the source's tag question structure, altering the rhetorical flow.","In the translation of `Et comment tant de Boules en peuvent-elles toucher une seule?` (And how can so many balls touch a single one?), the French `Boules` (balls, spheres) is rendered as the doublet `Bowls or Globes` within `so many Bowls or Globes`. The addition of `or Globes` provides a synonym or a more specific term, likely to ensure the reader understands the intended meaning of spherical objects.","In the translation of `Et comment tant de Boules en peuvent-elles toucher une seule?` as `how then can so many Bowls or Globes all touch one single one?`, the word `then` is inserted after `how`. This addition explicitly marks a logical consequence or sequence, making the connection to the preceding statement more pronounced than in the French `Et comment` (And how).","In the target sentence `how then can so many Bowls or Globes all touch one single one?`, the word `all` is added before `touch`. This addition emphasizes that every single one of the 'so many balls' (`tant de Boules`) is part of the problem of touching the single one, an intensification not explicitly present in the source.","The French `Je veux m'imaginer cela` (I want to imagine that) has `cela` (that) referring to the preceding problem of spheres touching. The target `I would fain imagine how this may be done` explicates `cela` by adding `how this may be done`. This addition clarifies the object of the verb 'imagine', making the Marquise's thought process more explicit.","The French `je ne le puis` (I cannot do it / I am not able to) is translated and elaborated in the target `cannot think which way`. The addition of `which way` specifies the nature of her inability, indicating she cannot conceive of the manner or method for imagining it, which is an elaboration not present in the source's simpler statement of incapacity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P097: Il y a beaucoup d'esprit, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">répondis-je</span></span>, à avoir cette difficulté-là, &amp; même à ne la pouvoir résoudre; car elle est tres-bonne en soy, &amp; de la maniere dont vous la concevez, elle est sans réponse, &amp; c'est avoir bien peu d'esprit que de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">trouver des réponses à ce qui n'en a point.</span></span> Si notre Tourbillon êtoit de la figure d'un Dé, il auroit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">six faces plates</span></span></span></span>, &amp; seroit bien éloigné d'être rond; mais sur chacune de ces faces on y pourroit mettre un Tourbillon de la même figure.

This specifies the nature of the unanswerable things, making the philosopher's statement more concrete.","The translator added 'squares or' before 'flat faces' to clarify the specific geometric shape of a die's faces, which are typically square, a detail not explicitly stated in the French 'faces plates' (flat faces).","The translator added 'Square' to 'faces' (in 'these six Square faces') when referring again to the die's faces, reinforcing an earlier clarification for the English reader, where the source text has 'faces plates'.","The translator added 'very many and' before 'little' (for 'petites'). This elaborates that the smallness of the facets is a consequence of their large number, a detail implied by the context of diamond cutting in the source's 'fort petites' (very small), but made explicit in the translation.","The translator expanded 'fort inégales' (very unequal) by adding 'and alike' in the phrase 'not all equal and alike'. While 'not all equal' translates the core meaning, 'and alike' introduces an additional nuance concerning similarity in form or nature beyond just size, thereby elaborating on the concept of inequality.","The translator added 'on which they stand' to elaborate on the French 'sont appuyez sur' (are supported by/lean on). This addition provides a more concrete and slightly more static image of how the vortices are positioned on the faces, enhancing the description.","The translator added the phrase 'and suffers nothing to be useless' as an elaboration of 'la Nature qui ménage bien le terrain' (Nature, who manages space/resources well). This addition introduces a well-known philosophical maxim about Nature's efficiency (similar to 'Nature abhors a vacuum' or 'Nature does nothing in vain'), making the concept more explicit or resonant for the English reader.","The translator added 'flat' before 'faces' in the phrase 'flat faces'. This maintains consistency with earlier descriptions of vortex boundaries and facets being flat, a detail not specified in this particular instance in the source 'n'a de faces' (has faces).","The translator expanded 'inutiles' (useless) to 'void and useless'. The addition of 'void and' emphasizes the emptiness of these corners of the universe before being filled by the small worlds, thereby strengthening the descriptive imagery.","The translator added 'with their being where they are' to elaborate on 'fort contents d'eux-mêmes' (very content with themselves). This addition specifies the reason or context for the contentment of the small worlds, explaining that their satisfaction stems from their specific location or existence.","The translator rendered 'le mieux qu'il est possible' (as best as possible) as 'in so admirable a manner'. The word 'admirable' introduces a qualitative judgment of wonder or excellence, adding a layer of appreciation not strictly present in the source's more functional description.","The translator elaborated on 'Ballon' (ball) by adding the descriptive phrase 'made of a Bladder, cover'd with Leather' after rendering 'Ballon' as the more specific 'Foot-ball'. This provides details about the typical construction of such balls at the time, making the analogy more vivid, concrete, and culturally relatable for an English audience.","The translator explicated 'il rentre en luy-même' (it re-enters itself/shrinks back/contracts) as 'returns to its first Figure'. This addition clarifies the result or consequence of the action of contracting, making the described physical process more easily understandable for the reader.","The translator added 'and sometimes seem not to shine at all' to elaborate on 'ne paroissent briller à reprises' (appear to shine intermittently/twinkle). While 'twinkling and trembling light' in the target text already captures the intermittency, this addition explicitly describes the 'off' phase of the stars' light, thereby providing a fuller description of the phenomenon.","The translator added 'and press' after 'push' (for the French 'poussent'). The source 'poussent' means 'push'. Adding 'and press' creates a doublet, which can intensify the action or suggest a more sustained or compressive type of force being exerted by the vortices, thereby elaborating on the nature of their interaction."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">J'aime ces Ballons qui s'enflent &amp; se desenflent à chaque moment</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">&amp; ces Mondes qui se combattent toûjours</span></span>, &amp; sur tout j'aime à voir comment ce combat fait entre eux un commerce de lumière, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">qui asseurément est le seul qu'ils puissent avoir.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P078: I am in love with these Fancies, said the Countess; I am pleas'd with these Foot-balls, which swell every moment, and sink again, and with these Worlds, which are continually striving and pushing one another: But above all, I am pleas'd to see how this justling keeps up the trade of Light, which is certainly the only correspondence that is between them.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P078: I am in love with these Fancies, said the Countess; I am pleas'd with these <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Foot-balls</span></span>, which swell every moment, and sink again, and with these Worlds, which are continually <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">striving and pushing one another</span></span>: But above all, I am pleas'd to see how this justling keeps up the trade of Light, which is certainly the only correspondence <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">that is between them</span></span>.</p>","explanations":["The word `Foot-balls` in the target replaces `Ballons` from the source clause `J'aime ces Ballons qui s'enflent & se desenflent à chaque moment`. \"Ballons\" can mean generic balls or balloons.

The French source 'ce n'est pas le seul' ('it is not the only one') is general, while the target text makes the reference concrete.","The translator added 'commerce' to specify the nature of the interaction being discussed. This term is not present in the general French source 'ce n'est pas le seul' ('it is not the only one') and adds a layer of specific interpretation.","The translator added 'and splendid' to 'magnificent' (which translates 'magnifiquement'). This elaboration intensifies the description of the comets' appearance, making it more ornate than the source.","The source uses the pronoun 'elle' ('she') in 'dit-elle'. The translator rendered this as 'said the Countess', explicitly identifying the speaker by her title (the Marquise is a Countess), thereby providing clarity.","The translator added the word 'indeed' after 'but' (translating 'mais'). This serves as an intensifier, adding a degree of emphasis not strictly present in the source conjunction.","The translator added the phrase 'now a days', introducing a specific temporal context (the present time) that is absent from the French source 'mais les enfants sont en grand nombre' (but children are in great number).","The source 'par ceux qui l'environnent' ('by those that surround it') is general. The translator specified 'ceux' (those) as 'those Vortex's', making an implicit understanding from Cartesian physics explicit by naming the surrounding entities.","The translator added the word 'still' to the clause 'it is the lower part that is still towards us.' This implies a continuous or persistent orientation of the vortex's lower part, a nuance not explicitly conveyed by the source's 'c'est par en-bas qu'il nous regarde' (it is the lower part that faces us).","The source states 'Il est nécessaire ... que ... il y ait un grand espace vide' (It is necessary ... that ... there be a large empty space). The translator added the clause 'they should be so high' (referring to comets) as being part of what 'is absolutely necessary', introducing an explicit assertion about the comets' altitude that is not directly stated as the object of 'nécessaire' in the source sentence for this specific point.","The translator added 'absolutely' as an intensifier to 'necessary'. The French source 'Il est nécessaire' ('It is necessary') is rendered more forcefully in the target text.","The translator added 'downwards' to the phrase 'From Saturn downwards to the outsides of our Vortex'. This specifies a direction for the location of the void space relative to Saturn, a detail not explicitly present in the source's 'depuis Saturne jusqu'aux deux extremitez...' ('from Saturn to the two extremities...').","The source states 'Nos Ennemis nous reprochent...' ('Our Enemies reproach us...'). The translator changed 'reprochent' (reproach) to 'ask us', thereby altering the verb describing the adversaries' action and framing their challenge as an inquiry rather than a direct reproach or accusation of uselessness.","The translator added the conjunction 'but' at the beginning of the clause 'but let them not trouble themselves any more'.

The addition of 'so much ... as to' emphasizes a failure to meet a certain degree ('so much') of respect required for the action, a quantitative aspect and causal linkage not explicitly detailed in the original phrase.","The French '& avec nos Planetes' uses 'avec' (with). The translator uses 'among' to specify the relationship in 'among our own Planets'.

The translator renders the assertion as \"it appears that we are very proud.\" The phrase \"it appears that\" is an addition which modifies the directness of the original statement, framing it more explicitly as an observation or inference rather than a direct statement of fact. This addition serves to normalize the expression in English by adding a degree of epistemic modality common in such contexts.","The source text uses \"un air bien menaçant\" (a very menacing/threatening look/appearance) to describe the foreign planets. The translator rendered this part of the sentence as \"have a terrible Countenance\". The word \"Countenance\" specifically implies a facial expression or face. This is an addition compared to the more general French term \"air\" (which can mean look, appearance, mien). Using \"Countenance\" personifies the planets (comets, given the mention of tails and beards) more strongly than the original French and was likely introduced by the translator for vividness or to use a more evocative English term, despite comets not literally having faces."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P103: Les queües &amp; les barbes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">répondis-je,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">ne sont que de pures apparences..</span></span> Les Planetes étrangères ne diffèrent en rien des nôtres, mais en entrant dans nütre Tourbillon, elles prennent la queüe ou la barbe par une certaine sorte d'illumination qu'elles reçoivent du Soleil, &amp; qui entre nous n'a pas encore êté trop bien expliquée; mais toûjours on est sûr qu'il ne s'agit que d'une espèce d'illumination; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">on la devinera quand on pourra.</span></span> Je voudrois donc bien, reprit- elle, que nôtre Saturne allât prendre une queuë ou une barbe dans quelque autre Tourbillon, &amp; y répandre l'effroy, &amp; qu'en suite ayant mis bas cet accompagnement terrible, il revint se ranger ici avec les autres Planetes à ses fonctions ordinaires.

How? cry'd the Countess, can Suns be put out? Yes, without doubt said I, for People some thousand years ago saw fix'd Stars in the Sky, which are now no more to be seen; these were Suns which have lost their Light, and certainly there must be strange Desolation in their Vortex's, and a general Mortality over all the Planets, for what can People do without a Sun? This is a dismal Fancy, said the Countess, I would not if I could help it, let it come into my head. I will tell you if you please, I reply'd, what in this particular is the Opinion of Learned Astronomers. They think that the fix'd Stars which have disappear'd, are not quite extinguish'd, but that they are <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">half Suns</span></span>, that is, they have one half Dark, and the other half Light, and turning round upon their own Axis or Centre, they sometimes shew us their Light side, and afterwards turning to us their Dark side, we see them no more. To oblige you Madam, I will be of this Opinion, because it is not so harsh as the other, but I cannot make it good, but in relation to some certain Stars, because as some have lately observed, those Stars have their Regulated times of appearing, and disappearing, otherwise there could be no such thing as half Suns. But what shall we say of Stars, which totally disappear, and never shew themselves again after they have finish'd their Course of turning round upon their own Axis? you are too just Madam to oblige me to believe that such Stars are half Suns. However I will try once more what I can do in favour of your Opinion; the Suns are not extinct, they are only sunk so low into the immense depth of Heaven, that we cannot possibly see them, in this Case the Vortex follows his Sun and all's well again. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fix'd Stars have not this motion, by which they remove themselves so far from us, because at other times they might return again nearer to us, and we should see them sometimes greater, and sometimes less, which never happens. But we will suppose that none but the Little, Light, and most Active Vortex's which slip between the others make certain voyages, after which they return again, while the main body of Vortex's remain unmov'd. 'Tis likewise very strange that some fix'd Stars shew themselves to us, spending a great deal of time in appearing, and disappearing, and at last, totally and entirely disappear. Half Suns would appear again at their set and regulated time. Now Madam, boldly declare your Opinion; Must not these Stars of necessity be Suns which are so much darkned as not to be visible to us, yet afterwards shine again, and at last are wholly extinct? How can a Sun said the Countess, be darkned, and quite extinguish'd, when it is in its own Nature a Fountain of Light? It may be done Madam, said I, with all the ease in the world, if Desc�rtes Opinion be true, that our Sun hath Spots; now whether these Spots be Scum or thick Mists, or what you please, they may thicken and unite, till at last they cover the Sun with a Crust, which daily grows thicker, and then Farewell Sun. We have hitherto scap'd pretty well; but 'tis said, that the Sun for some whole years together hath look'd very pale; for Example, the year after Caesar's death; it was this Crust that then began to grow, but the force of the Sun broke and dissipated it; had it continued, we had been all lost People. You make me tremble, reply'd the Countess; and now I know the fatal consequences of the Sun's paleness, I believe, instead of going every morning to my Glass, to see how I look, I shall cast my Eyes up to Heaven, to see whether or no the Sun looks pale. Oh, Madam, said I, there is a great deal of time required to ruine a World. Grant it, said she, yet 'tis but time that is required. I confess it, said I; all this immense mass of Matter that composes the Universe, is in perpetual motion, no part of it excepted; and since every part is moved, you may be sure that changes must happen sooner or later; but still in times proportioned to the Effect. The Ancients were <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">pleasant Gentlemen</span></span>, to imagine that the celestial Bodies were in their own nature unchangeable, because they observed no change in them; but they did not live long enough to confirm their opinion by their own experience; they were Boys in comparison of us. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">Give me leave, Madam, to explain my self by an Allegory</span></span>: If Roses, which last but a day, could write Histories, and leave Memoirs one to another; and if the first Rose should draw an exact Picture of their Gardiner, and after fifteen thousand Rose-Ages, it should be left to other Roses, and so left still to those that should succeed, without any change in it; should the Roses hereupon say, we have every day seen the same Gardiner, and in the memory of Roses, none ever saw any Gardiner but this; he is still the same he was, and therefore certainly he will never die, as we do; for there is no change at all in him. Would not these Roses, Madam, talk very foolishly? and yet there would be more reason in their discourse, than there was in what the Ancients said concerning celestial Bodies; and tho' even to this very day there should appear no visible change in the Heavens, and the matter of which they are made, should have all the signs of an eternal duration without any change; yet I would not believe 'em unchangeable, till I had the experience of many more Ages. Ought we, who last but a moment, make our continuance the measure of any other things duration; 'tis not so easie a matter to be eternal. To have lasted many Ages of Men, one after another, is no sign of Immortality. Truly, says the Countess, I find the Worlds are far from being able to pretend to it; I will not do 'em so much honour, as to ompare 'em to the Gardiner that lived so much longer than the Roses: I begin to think 'em like the Roses themselves, which blow one day, and die the next: For now I understand, that if old Stars disappear, new ones will come in their room, because every species must preserve it self. No species, Madam, said I, can totally perish; some perhaps will tell you, that such new Stars are Suns, which return to our sight again, after they have been a long time hid from us, in the profundity of Heaven: Others may tell you, they are Suns cleared from that thick crust, which once covered them: If I should think all this possible, yet I likewise believe that the Universe may be framed in such a manner, that from time to time it may produce new Suns; why may not that matter which is proper to make a Sun, be dispers'd here and there, and gather it self again at long run, into one certain place, and lay the foundation of a new World? I am very much inclin'd to believe such new productions, because they suit with that glorious and admirable Idea which I have of the works of Nature. Can we think that wise Nature knows no more than the secret of making Herbs and Plants live and die by a continual revolution? I am verily perswaded, and are not you so too, Madam? that Nature, without much cost or pains can put the same secret in practice, upon the Worlds. I now find, says the Countess, the Worlds, the Heaven, and celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am come to my self again. To come the better again to our selves, I reply'd, let us say no more of these Matters. We are arrived at the very roof and top of all the Heavens; and to tell you whether there be any Stars beyond it, you must have an abler Man than I am; you may place Worlds there, or no Worlds, as you please: 'Tis the Philosopher's Empire to describe those vast invisible Countries, which are, and are not, or are such as he pleases to make 'em: It is enough for me, to have carried your mind as far as you can see with your Eyes.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P083: You have no reason then, said I, to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, yet I suppose you will think their Condition lamentable, who inhabit a Vortex whose Sun comes in time to be quite extinguished, and consequently live in Eternal Night. How? cry'd the Countess, can Suns be put out? Yes, without doubt said I, for People <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">some</span></span> thousand years ago</span></span> saw fix'd Stars in the Sky, which are now no more to be seen; these were Suns which have lost their Light, and certainly there must be strange Desolation in their Vortex's, and a general Mortality over all the Planets, for what can People do without a Sun? This is a dismal Fancy, said the Countess, I would not <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">if I could help it, let it come into my head</span></span>. I will tell you if you please, I reply'd, what <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">in this particular is the Opinion of Learned Astronomers</span></span>. They think that the fix'd Stars which have disappear'd, are not quite extinguish'd, but that they are half Suns, that is, they have one half Dark, and the other half Light, and turning round upon their own Axis <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">or Centre</span></span>, they sometimes shew us their Light side, and afterwards turning to us their Dark side, we see them no more. To oblige you <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"29\">Madam,</span></span> I will be of this Opinion, because it is not so harsh as the other, but I cannot make it good, but in relation to some certain Stars, because as some have <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">lately</span></span> observed, those Stars have their Regulated times of appearing, and disappearing, otherwise there could be no such thing as half Suns. But what shall we say of Stars, which totally disappear, and never shew themselves <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"33\">again</span></span></span></span> after they have finish'd their Course of turning round upon their own Axis? you are too just Madam to oblige me to believe that such Stars are half Suns. However I will try once more <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">what I can do</span></span> in favour of your Opinion; the Suns are not extinct, they are only sunk <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">so low</span></span> into the immense depth of Heaven, that we cannot possibly see them, in this Case the Vortex follows his Sun and all's well again. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fix'd Stars have not this motion, by which they remove themselves so far from us, because at other times they might return again nearer to us, and we should see them sometimes greater, and sometimes less, which never happens. But we will suppose that none but the Little, Light, and most Active Vortex's which slip between the others make certain voyages, after which they return again, while the main body of Vortex's remain unmov'd. 'Tis likewise very strange that some fix'd Stars shew themselves to us, spending a great deal of time in appearing, and disappearing, and at last, totally and entirely disappear. Half Suns would appear again at their <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">set and</span></span> regulated time.

How can a Sun said the Countess, be darkned, and quite extinguish'd, when it is <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">in its own Nature</span></span> a Fountain of Light? It may be done <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">Madam, said I,</span></span> with all the ease in the world, if Desc�rtes Opinion be true, that our Sun hath Spots; now whether these Spots be Scum or <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">thick</span></span> Mists, or what you please, they may thicken and unite, till at last they cover the Sun with a Crust, which <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">daily</span></span> grows thicker, and then Farewell Sun. We have <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">hitherto scap'd pretty well</span></span>; but 'tis said, that the Sun for some whole years <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">together</span></span> hath look'd very pale; for Example, the year after Caesar's death; it was this Crust that then began to grow, but the force of the Sun broke and dissipated it; had it continued, we had been <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">all lost People</span></span>.

The French 'N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner?' (Isn't there a way to spare me it?) is more concise. The addition 'if I could help it, let it come into my head' makes her reluctance more explicit and idiomatic in English.","The translator replaces the general 'ce que disent de fort habiles Gens' (what very skilled people say) with the more specific and formal 'what in this particular is the Opinion of Learned Astronomers,' clarifying both the source of the information and its context.","The translator adds 'or Centre' after 'Axis' (which itself interprets 'sur eux-mêmes' - on themselves). This provides an alternative or synonymous term for the axis of rotation, potentially for clarity for English readers.","The translator adds 'lately' to the observation ('as some have lately observed'), specifying a recency not explicitly present in the French 'ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir' (as one has begun to notice it).","The translator adds 'what I can do' to the philosopher's statement of making an effort ('je feray encore un effort en votre faveur.'), making the nature of the effort more explicit.","The translator adds 'so low' to 'sunk,' emphasizing the degree of sinking into Heaven's depths more explicitly than the French 'enfoncez' (sunk/plunged).","The translator adds 'again' to 'all's well.' The French 'tout s'y portera bien.' (all will be well there.) does not explicitly state 'again.' The addition implies a restoration to a previous good state.","The translator adds 'set and' before 'regulated time.' The French 'des temps reglez.' (regulated times) is covered by 'regulated time'; 'set and' reinforces the idea of fixed, predetermined times.","The translator expands 'en lui-même' (in itself) to 'in its own Nature,' emphasizing the inherent, essential quality of the sun as a light source.","The French 'Le plus aisément du Monde' (Most easily in the world) is the philosopher's direct response. The translator adds the speech tag 'Madam, said I,' to explicitly attribute speech and maintain conversational flow, which is common in English dialogue.","The translator adds 'thick' to 'Mists' (for 'des brouillards' - mists/fogs). While fogs/mists can be thick, this addition makes the quality explicit, potentially enhancing the imagery of obscurity.","The translator specifies the continuous growth described by 's'augmentera toûjours' (will always/continuously increase) as happening 'daily,' providing a specific frequency not explicit in the source.","The translator expands the concise French 'Nous l'avons déja même échepée' (We have even already escaped it) into the more elaborate 'We have hitherto scap'd pretty well.' The additions 'hitherto' and 'pretty well' provide a more nuanced temporal framing and a qualitative assessment of the escape.","The translator adds 'some' before 'whole years.' The French 'des années entières' means 'whole years' or 'entire years'; 'some' specifies an indeterminate quantity, a nuance added by the translator.","The translator adds 'together' after 'whole years,' emphasizing the continuous, unbroken period of these years. The French 'des années entières' (whole/entire years) implies continuity but 'together' makes it more explicit.","The translator expands 'nous étions perdus.' (we were lost.) to 'we had been all lost People.' The addition of 'all' emphasizes the totality of the 'we,' and 'People' makes the subject more concrete.","The translator adds the adjective 'fatal' to 'consequences,' heightening the dramatic impact of the sun's paleness, an emphasis not explicitly in the French 'les consequences.'","The translator renders the Countess's interjection 'Mais enfin' (But in the end / Well then) as 'Grant it.' This introduces a concessive speech act not directly present in the French, framing her subsequent statement as an agreement with an implied preceding point.","The translator replaces the French warning combined with necessity 'ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements' (roughly, 'don't be complacent about it, changes must happen') with 'you may be sure that changes must happen.' This phrase introduces a stronger sense of certainty and direct assurance.","The translator expands 'Les Anciens êtaient plaisants' (The Ancients were amusing/quaint) to 'The Ancients were pleasant Gentlemen.' The addition of 'Gentlemen' adds a social descriptor or a touch of perhaps ironic politeness not present in 'plaisants.'","The translator inserts the polite framing 'Give me leave, Madam, to explain my self by an Allegory:' before the philosopher begins the rose analogy. This meta-commentary on the discourse is not present in the source and serves to explicitly introduce the upcoming analogy.","The translator adds 'therefore' before 'certainly' (which translates 'assurément'). While 'assurément' in French conveys certainty, the addition of 'therefore' explicitly marks a logical conclusion drawn by the roses.","The translator recasts the neutral rhetorical question 'Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon?' (Would the Roses' reasoning be sound?) by adding a direct address 'Madam,' and changing 'seroit-il bon?' to the much stronger and interpretive 'talk very foolishly?'.","The translator adds 'visible' to 'change.' The French 'aucun changement' (no change) is absolute; 'no visible change' qualifies the type of change being discussed, implying that unseeable changes might still occur.","The translator inserts 'and the matter of which they are made,' following 'the Heavens.' This phrase explicitly introduces the composition of the celestial bodies ('les Cieux'), a detail not directly specified in the French, which uses a pronoun 'ils' (they) referring back to 'les Cieux'.","The translator adds 'one after another' to describe 'many Ages of Men.' The French 'bien des âges d'homme mis à bout' (many ages of man put end to end) implies succession; 'one after another' makes this explicit.","The translator prefaces the comparison to roses with 'I begin to think 'em.' The French 'ils ne sont que comme les Roses même' (they are but like the roses themselves) is a direct statement. The addition expresses the Countess's evolving understanding or a new thought process.","The translator changes 'car je m'attends bien que' (for I well expect that) to 'For now I understand, that.' This shifts the meaning from expectation to a newly acquired understanding on the part of the Countess.","The translator adds 'Madam,' into the philosopher's speech, maintaining the direct address to the Countess common in the English translation's dialogue style.","The translator adds 'perhaps' to 'some will tell you.' This introduces a degree of uncertainty or modality about what these 'some' people might say, which is not explicitly present in the French 'Les uns vous diront que' (Some will tell you that).","The translator clarifies 'ce ne sont que des Soleils' (they are only Suns) as 'such new Stars are Suns.' This explicitly links this explanation back to the topic of new stars appearing, providing context for the reader.","The translator recasts 'Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais...' (I easily believe that all that can be, but...) as 'If I should think all this possible, yet I likewise believe...'. This introduces a more complex concessive or hypothetical structure, framing the philosopher's belief in a slightly different argumentative light.","The translator adds 'again' to 'gather it self.' The French 'se ramasser à la longue' (to gather itself in the long run) does not inherently include the idea of repetition or restoration implied by 'again.'","The translator expands 'la haute idée' (the high idea) to 'that glorious and admirable Idea.' This addition significantly elaborates on the nature of the idea, making it more vivid and impressive for the English audience.","The translator changes the French rhetorical question about Nature ('N'auroit-elle le secret que...') into a question directed at the interlocutors ('Can we think that...') and adds the epithet 'wise' to 'Nature,' altering the focus and characterization.","The translator adds 'Madam?' to the phrase, turning the statement '& vous l'êtes déja aussi' (and you are so already too) into a direct question to the Countess and maintaining the dialogic style.","The translator expands 'qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage' (that it doesn't cost her more) to 'without much cost or pains.' The addition of 'much' and the common English doublet 'cost or pains' elaborates on the ease with which Nature performs this act.","The translator adds 'of these Matters' to 'let us say no more.' The French 'n'en parlons plus' (let's not speak of it/them anymore) uses a pronoun 'en' (of it/them). The addition makes the object of their silence explicit.","The translator expands 'la derniere voûte des Cieux' (the last vault of the Heavens) to 'the very roof and top of all the Heavens.' This elaboration uses more vivid imagery and emphasis ('very,' 'roof and top,' 'of all') to describe their conceptual stopping point.","The translator adds 'to describe' after ''Tis the Philosopher's Empire.' The French 'C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles' states it is the philosophers' empire *that consists of* these vast invisible countries. The addition 'to describe' specifies the philosophers' role or activity concerning these realms."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">s'écria-t-elle</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">j'ay dans la tête</span></span> tout le systeme de l'Univers! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Je suis savante!</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Oüy, répliquay-je</span></span>, vous l'êtes assez raisonnablement, &amp; vous l'êtes avec la commodité <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">de pouvoir ne rien croire</span></span> de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Je vous demande seulement</span></span> pour recompense de mes peines de ne voir jamais le Soleil, ny le Ciel, ny les Etoiles, sans songer à moy.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P084: Well, says the Countess, I have now in my Head, the System of the Universe: How learned am I become?
