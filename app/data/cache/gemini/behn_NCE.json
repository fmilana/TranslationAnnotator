Que la Terre est une planète qui tourne sur elle-même, et autour du Soleil', which includes both a temporal marker ('PREMIER SOIR.') and a descriptive scientific subtitle. The English translation by Aphra Behn renders this as 'THE First Night.', thereby omitting the entire scientific subtitle 'Que la Terre est une planète qui tourne sur elle-même, et autour du Soleil'. This significant omission and simplification is an instance of domestication. It adapts the French heading style to English literary conventions of the late 17th century, which may have favored more concise and less overtly didactic titles for popular works, even those with scientific content. This aligns the text's presentation with target cultural expectations for the genre, making the chapter headings appear less academic and potentially more accessible or stylistically familiar to an English readership."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P002: Nous allâmes donc un Soir aprés Soupé, nous promener dans le Parc. Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description</span></span>, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences;</span></span> d'où cela vient-il? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver.</span></span> Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée. Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle. Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">Non, répliquai-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.</span></span> Cherchez ailleurs des Philosophes </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description, which I cannot well avoid, the fineness of it leading me so necessarily to it.</p> <p>P003: The Moon was about an hour high, which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, and checker'd the Paths beneath with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light; there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed: These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation; but the Presence of a Person of her Wit and Beauty hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars. Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day? I confess, said she, the Day must yield to such a Night; the day which resembles a fair Beauty, which though more sparkling, is not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night. You are very generous, Madam, said I, to give the advantage to the brown, you who are so admirably fair your self: Yet without dispute, day is the most beautiful thing in Nature; and most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair. But, said she, Beauty is insipid, if it want the pleasure and power of charming; and you must acknowledge that the brightest day that ever you saw could never have engaged you in so agreeable an Ecstasie, as you were just now like to have faln into by the powerful attractions of this Night.</p> <p>P004: I agree to what you say, Madam, said I, but I must own at the same time, that a Beauty of your complexion would give me another sort of transport than the finest Night with all the advantages obscurity can give it.</p> <p>P005: Though that were true, said she, I should not be satisfied; since those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other. How comes it, that Lovers who are the best Judges of what is pleasing and touching, do always address themselves to the Night, in all their Songs and Elegies? I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that? The silence and gloom of the Night, said I, inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing. Besides, the Scene of the Universe by day-light appears too Uniform, we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts. Sir, replied Madam la Marqueise, I have always felt those effects of Night you tell me of, I love the Stars, and could be heartily angry with the Sun for taking them from my sight. Ah, cry'd I, I cannot forgive his taking from me the sight of all those Worlds that are there. Worlds, said she, what Worlds? And looking earnestly upon me, asked me again, what I meant? I ask your Pardon, Madam, said I, I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness. What weakness, said she, more earnestly than before? Alass, said I, I am sorry that I must confess I have imagined to my self, that every Star may perchance be another World, yet I would not swear that it is so; but I will believe it to be true, because that Opinion is so pleasant to me, and gives me very diverting Idea's, which have fixed themselves delightfully in my Imaginations, and 'tis necessary that even solid Truth should have it's agreeableness. Well, said she, since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it; I will believe whatever you please concerning the Stars, if I find it pleasant. Ah, Madam, said I, hastily, it is not such a Pleasure as you find in one of Mullier's Plays; it is a Pleasure that is-I know not where, in our Reason, and which only transports the Mind. What, replied she, do you think me then incapable of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind? I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars.

This omission simplifies the narrative structure for the English reader by eliminating an epistolary convention that might seem less direct or more formal, thereby adapting the text's presentation to potentially broader target audience expectations.","The translator expands the philosopher's relatively simple statement that night deserves lovers' thanks ('Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements') by adding a specific, worldly reason: 'for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs.' This addition introduces a knowing, slightly conspiratorial tone related to amorous pursuits, adapting the gallantry of the dialogue to a style potentially more aligned with late 17th-century English literary conventions of wit and worldly sophistication.","The translator elaborates the Marquise's observation by adding that night acts 'as a true Confident of all their Entrigues.' The French ('elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences') is more general. The introduction of 'Entrigues' (intrigues/affairs) lends a specific and suggestive connotation, tailoring the dialogue to an English audience possibly accustomed to such sophisticated and worldly undertones in discussions of gallantry, aligning it with target culture norms for witty exchanges.","Fontenelle's straightforward description of night's effect ('qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste & de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos...on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux') is significantly rephrased and amplified. The English version introduces 'the restless Sigher,' specific landscape imagery ('dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes'), and a more conventionally literary psychological state ('vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing' for 'on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux'). This transformation adapts the original's musing into a more romanticized and elaborate description, aligning with English literary tastes of the period and softening 'fou' (mad/crazy) to the more socially acceptable 'vain'.","The translation changes 'un Bois' (a wood/forest) to 'a Grove,' a term often associated with more cultivated, idyllic, or conventionally romantic settings in English literature, thus adapting the scene to a familiar target culture image. Furthermore, 'la plus aimable personne que je connoisse' (the most amiable/likeable person I know) is intensified to 'the greatest Beauty in the World.' This shifts the compliment from general charm to an extravagant focus on physical appearance, a common trope in English Restoration and late 17th-century gallantry. The entire utterance is also made more dramatic with additions like 'Ah, Madam, cry'd I, I shall never indure to be reproach'd with that neglect of my own happiness', aligning the philosopher's excuse with target culture literary and social conventions of heightened expression."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder.

The English 'was a Planet' translates this with a higher degree of certainty, presenting it as a more established fact. This domestication adapts the original's speculative epistemic stance to potentially align with a target culture where such scientific ideas were becoming more asserted or to make the concept more directly accessible, reducing its 'foreignness' as a controversial proposition.","The French 'Physique,' referring broadly to natural science, is rendered as 'Natural Philosophy.' In late 17th-century England, 'Natural Philosophy' was the prominent term used by leading scientific figures like Isaac Newton (e.g., *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, 1687) and members of the Royal Society. Choosing 'Natural Philosophy' over other potential English equivalents (like 'physics' in its broader contemporary sense) domesticates the text by aligning the discourse with the specific, high-status scientific vernacular of the English intellectual elite. This makes the dialogue resonate more strongly with the target culture's contemporary scientific context, framing it in terms familiar and prestigious to an educated English audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais</span></span>; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes: &amp; si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir, ce qui reviendrait au même. Mais on veut savoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyait bien, ce serait toujours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voient point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toujours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opéra. Du lieu où vous êtes à l'Opéra, vous ne voyez pas le Théâtre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à votre veue ces roues &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvements. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner comment tout cela joue. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre</span></span>, qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien qu'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers; car représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyaient le Vol de Phaéton que les Vents enlèvent, qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton. L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide; &amp; cent autres <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">rêveries</span></span>, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">A la fin</span></span> Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">Ainsi on ne croit plus</span></span> qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra.

This substitution of a culture-specific theatrical term makes the analogy immediately comprehensible to an English audience by using a reference from their own cultural experience.","The French \"rêveries\" (daydreams, wild fancies, idle speculations), used by Fontenelle with a playful, slightly dismissive tone towards ancient philosophical explanations, is translated as \"Notions.\" The English \"Notions\" is more neutral and less critical. This toning down adapts the text by softening Fontenelle's critique, potentially to align with a target culture that might have maintained a more consistently reverent or serious attitude towards classical philosophers, or preferred a less overtly mocking tone in such discussions.","The French \"A la fin\" (Finally/In the end), which marks the culmination of a sequence of historical philosophical ideas within the narrative, is rendered as \"In our Age.\" This translation shifts the temporal focus from the logical progression in Fontenelle's argument to the contemporary period of the English translator and readers. This change domesticates the text by making the advent of modern (Cartesian) philosophy, and by extension the Enlightenment perspective, feel more immediate and directly relevant to the late 17th-century English audience.","Reinforcing the temporal domestication seen in the translation of \"A la fin\" to \"In our Age,\" the French \"Ainsi on ne croit plus\" (Thus, one no longer believes) is translated as \"And now men do not believe.\" The explicit addition of \"now\" firmly anchors the described shift in belief (towards mechanistic philosophy) in the present time of the target audience, making this philosophical evolution appear as a contemporary reality for them.","Fontenelle's evocative phrase \"un faux Merveilleux\" (a false sense of the Marvelous/Wonder) is transformed into the more analytical and abstract \"some false Principle or other of Admiration.\" This conceptual shift domesticates the text by replacing a term rich in literary and imaginative connotation with a more rationalistic and philosophical phrasing. This adaptation likely aimed to align the text with perceived English intellectual tastes of the period, which might have favored such explicit conceptualization over more poetic or suggestive language in scientific popularization.","The French \"Magie\" (magic) is translated as \"Miracle.\" In the specific English socio-religious context of the late 17th century, characterized by Protestant anxieties about Catholicism, superstition, and occultism, the term \"magic\" could carry strong negative connotations. \"Miracle,\" while also denoting the inexplicable, is a term more integrated into accepted Christian theological discourse. The translator's choice may have been a deliberate domestication to render the concept less potentially offensive or controversial, framing it within a vocabulary more familiar and perhaps less alarming to the English Protestant readership, even as Fontenelle critiques the unthinking awe associated with it."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">comme des cloux</span></span>.

The addition of 'Golden' and the intensifier 'so many' embellishes the original, simpler simile. This adaptation makes the imagery more ornate, potentially aligning it with English literary or poetic conventions of the period for popular works, thereby conforming the style to target culture aesthetic norms and making the description more familiar or appealing to the English reader.","The French source uses 'Le Chariot', which is a common French name for the asterism known in English as the Big Dipper or The Plough. The translation replaces this with 'Charles's-Wain', a traditional and culturally specific English folk name for the same asterism. This substitution of a source-culture reference with a familiar target-culture equivalent makes the text more immediately accessible and resonant for an English-speaking audience of the time, reducing its foreignness.","The French source states 'la Geometrie est fille de l'Interêt' (Geometry is daughter of Interest), using 'fille' (daughter) consistently for personifications (e.g., 'l'Astronomie est fille de l'Oisiveté' translated as 'Astronomy is the Daughter of Idleness'). However, for Geometry, the translation shifts to 'Geometry is the Child of Interest'. This change likely adapts the personification to English idiomatic preferences, where 'Child of [Abstract Noun]' might be a more common, natural-sounding, or stylistically preferred construction than 'Daughter of Interest', thus aligning the expression with target linguistic norms for accessibility and fluency."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie. La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus intéressée que je ne l'ai, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">une espece d'enchere</span></span>, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation. Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">Gens tres-considerables</span></span>. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">se tira habilement d'affaire</span></span>. Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy. </p><p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il? Avez-vous remarqué, lui répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? Elle va vers <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">le but</span></span> où elle est envoyée, &amp; en même temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-même, en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut. La Terre fait la même chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures. Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le côté où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse. Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la même cause. Les Planètes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nôtre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planètes marchent aussi; cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard, &amp; nous fait paroître dans leur cours des bizarreries dont il n'est pas nécessaire que je vous parle. Il suffit que vous sachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irrégulier dans les Planètes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont notre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fond elles sont toutes très-reglées. Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, on ne l'a guere ménagée, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité.. Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures. </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">un gros Navire monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises?</span></span> Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes. Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fût cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matière céleste, &amp; ne pas s'y laisser emporter? C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</p> <p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\">she</span></span>is setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy.

There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties. </p><p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">People of the first Quality</span></span>. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">he wisely left the World</span></span>, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">the Jack</span></span>, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board</span></span>, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","explanations":["The French term \"enchere\" (auction/bidding), in the context of achieving efficiency at least cost, is translated as \"Sale or Farm.\" \"Farming\" a task or revenue (i.e., contracting it out to the party offering the best financial terms) was a familiar concept in English administration and commerce of the period. This phrasing adapts the general idea of competitive bidding by using terms more specifically resonant with English economic or contractual practices, making the analogy more concrete for the target audience.","The French \"Gens tres-considerables\" (very important/influential people) is translated as \"People of the first Quality.\" The English phrase was a common term in the late 17th and 18th centuries that specifically denoted individuals of high social rank or nobility. This translation adapts the more general French term, which could refer to influence derived from learning or position, to a term emphasizing the English social hierarchy, thereby aligning with target culture social categories and values.","The French phrase \"se tira habilement d'affaire\" (he cleverly extricated himself from the situation/affair) is rendered as \"he wisely left the World.\" This translation introduces a euphemistic and somewhat moralizing tone (through \"wisely\" and the gentle phrasing for dying) that softens the French original's more direct, almost cynical pragmatism. This adaptation likely aligns the expression with English sensibilities of the period regarding polite or refined discourse, especially concerning the death of a significant figure, thus conforming to target culture norms of expression.","In the analogy describing the motion of a bowling ball, the French term \"le but\" (the goal, the target in a game) is translated as \"the Jack.\" \"The Jack\" is the specific English term for the small target ball in the game of bowls, a popular pastime in England. This substitution replaces a general French term with a culturally specific English one, making the analogy more vivid and immediately understandable for an English reader familiar with the game.","The French description of a large, heavily manned ship, potentially carrying \"Marchandises\" (merchandise), is systematically altered to depict a specifically English \"First-Rate\" warship. \"Un gros Navire\" (a large ship) becomes \"a First-Rate Ship,\" a term from the Royal Navy's ship classification system. The armament is changed from \"cent cinquante pièces de Canon\" (150 cannons) to \"a hundred and twenty Guns,\" and the crew size from \"plus de trois mille hommes\" (more than 3000 men) to \"fifteen hundred Men,\" figures perhaps considered more representative by the translator for such an English warship. Crucially, \"Marchandises\" is replaced by \"proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board,\" which are supplies specific to a warship, not general commercial cargo. This comprehensive adaptation domesticates the example by grounding it firmly within the English naval context, making it more specific, relatable, and resonant for the target audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P011: Mais, répliqua-t-elle encore, comment la Terre avec tout son poids se soûtient- elle sur votre matiere celeste qui doit être bien legere, puisqu'elle est si fluide?

The English translation substitutes this with 'the First-Rate Ship, I spoke of'. 'First-Rate Ship' was a specific classification for the largest and most powerful warships in the 17th-century British Royal Navy. This domestication replaces a general French term with a specific, prestigious English naval reference, making the analogy more concrete and resonant for the target culture.","The French 'une pirouette aussi legere que vous me faites la Terre' (a pirouette as light as you make the Earth to be) uses the imagery of a spinning dance move. The English translation uses 'such a little Humming-Top, as you have made the World to be'. A 'humming-top' was a common English child's toy. This substitution domesticates the metaphor by replacing a potentially more elegant or French-associated image with a very familiar, everyday object from the target culture, enhancing accessibility for English readers.","The French 'des têtes cheveluës' (long-haired heads or hairy heads) is a physical description of people. The English translation 'Hands cover'd with Wool' entirely transforms this image. This is a domestication by transformation of a foreign element. It eliminates the original straightforward description and substitutes it with a peculiar, different image, possibly to replace a generic 'othering' detail with one that had specific (though now potentially obscure) connotations for the 17th-century English audience, or to alter a detail about foreign peoples.","The French phrase 'grands Païs qui n'ont que des Cabanes' (large lands/countries that only have huts) is translated as 'spacious Fields, without Towns, only Tents and Huts.' This translation domesticates the original by rendering 'grands Païs' more pictorially in English as 'spacious Fields, without Towns,' and by expanding 'Cabanes' (huts) to the common English collocation 'Tents and Huts.' This aligns the description with established English literary conventions for depicting vast, sparsely populated regions and their dwellings, making the imagery more familiar to the target audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.

The translation renders this specific descriptive element as \"with more Gravity, but less Pleasure\" within the corresponding clause. While \"more gravity\" can be an antonym of \"gaiety,\" the choice of \"Gravity\" (a term that could carry positive connotations of seriousness in English culture, especially concerning politics) and the restructuring of the sentiment subtly reframe the comparison. This domestication adapts the description of the English to potentially align more closely with 17th-century English self-perception or common stereotypes of English national character (serious, grave) versus French \"gaieté,\" making the portrayal less about a perceived lack (of gaiety) and more about a different, possibly valued, characteristic (gravity).","The French text refers to \"des Iroquois,\" a specific Indigenous people of North America. The translation replaces this with \"the Canibals,\" a general and often sensationalized term. This is a domestication as it substitutes a specific cultural reference, which might be less familiar to the 17th-century English reader, with a generic concept that, while possibly misrepresentative, would evoke a readily understood (though stereotypical) image of \"savagery\" associated with distant lands, making the text more accessible by reducing foreign specificity.","The French \"de petits Tartares\" (little Tartars) is a somewhat general term for various smaller Tatar groups. The English translation specifies this as \"the Crim, or Little Tartars.\" The Crimean Tatars (\"Crim Tartars\") were a specific group well-known in 17th-century Europe, including England, for their raids and military activities. By adding \"Crim,\" the translator domesticates the text by replacing a potentially vague or less specific source culture reference with a more concrete and recognizable historical entity for the English audience, enhancing comprehensibility by grounding the reference in known geopolitical realities of the time.","The French phrase \"debiterons peut-être encore des rêveries\" suggests uttering or expounding on \"musings,\" \"fancies,\" or \"speculative thoughts,\" fitting Fontenelle's elegant and imaginative popularization of science. The English translation \"perhaps talking as we do now\" renders this as simple conversation.

The English translation \"the Polititians\" replaces this broader, descriptive phrase with a more concrete noun. This change makes the reference more specific and potentially more directly resonant with an English audience of the late 17th century, for whom the term 'Politicians' might evoke particular figures or carry specific connotations related to their own turbulent political landscape (e.g., Whigs and Tories). This domestication grounds the abstract French concept into a more familiar and possibly more pointed social category within the target culture.","The French phrase \"dans leurs faveurs un superflu\" (in their favors a surplus), referring to sexual favors, is relatively direct and concise. The English translation renders this as \"finding so many Charms in their Embraces, as more than satisfie them.\" This is a significant elaboration and euphemization. \"Leurs faveurs\" (their favors) is transformed into the more romanticized and less direct \"so many Charms in their Embraces.\" The notion of \"un superflu\" (a surplus) is explained more delicately as a consequence of the husbands being \"more than satisfie[d]\". This adaptation softens the original's potential bluntness, aligning the expression of a risqué topic with what might have been perceived as more acceptable or genteel norms of discourse in popular English literature of the period, especially in a work accessible to women."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P016: Vous me présentez la Terre sous des idées bien méprisables, dit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">la Marquise</span></span>.

This domesticates the text by infusing a level of overt formality expected by the target culture, potentially making the interaction seem more recognizably refined to an English reader but slightly altering the more direct French conversational style.","The French source poses an impersonal question about whether the Earth's movement ('il') would leave a mark. The English translation domesticates this by introducing 'Nature' as a conscious, caring agent ('Nature wou'd have taken care'). This personification adapts the abstract scientific query to a conceptual framework likely more familiar within English natural philosophy or deistic thought of the era, which often emphasized providential design in nature. This makes the argument more accessible but shifts its philosophical nuance from an observation about physical phenomena to an expectation of Nature's purposive action.","The French 'cela s'appelle bâiller' (literally, 'that is called yawning' or 'that makes one yawn') is an impersonal, sophisticated witticism implying that the philosopher's moralizing detour during a physics discussion is inherently boring. The English translation domesticates this by changing it to a direct, personal observation by the Marquise: 'But I perceive *you* are sleepy, and begin to yawn.' This transformation makes the Marquise's remark more concrete and character-driven, possibly aligning with English preferences for more straightforward dialogue, but in doing so, it can erase the original's abstract, ironic Gallic wit for a more common type of social interaction.","The French source refers to the character simply as 'la Marquise' (the Marquise), a standard and sufficient reference in French. The English translation expands this to 'my Lady Marquiese.' The addition of the English honorific 'my Lady' domesticates the text by conforming the narrator's reference to English socio-linguistic norms for addressing or speaking of nobility. This makes the character's reference in this sentence more conventional and familiar to an English readership of the period but imposes a layer of English formality not explicit in the original French phrasing, thus reducing a foreign cultural element."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">SECOND SOIR.

Que la Lune est une Terre habitée.' (which translates to 'Second Evening. That the Moon is an inhabited Earth.'), includes a descriptive subtitle that explicitly states a key and potentially controversial scientific idea central to Fontenelle's work. The English translation, 'The Second Night.', entirely omits this subtitle. This omission is a clear instance of domestication, as it eliminates a direct assertion about the Moon's habitability from the chapter heading. By doing so, the translator makes the introduction to the chapter's content more neutral and less overtly challenging for the 17th-century English target audience, who might have found such a bold scientific claim conflicting with prevailing religious or philosophical views, especially given the socio-religious tensions in England at the time. This alteration reduces the 'foreignness' of Fontenelle's novel ideas by making the claim less prominent in the chapter's structural signposting, potentially aiming for a more cautious reception or to avoid immediate controversy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P021: Le lendemain au matin dès que l'on pût entrer dans l'Appartement de la Marquise, j'envoyai savoir de ses nouvelles, &amp; lui demander si elle avoit pû dormir en tournant.

She sent me word, that now she was pretty well accustom'd to the Motion of the Earth, and that Copernicus himself cou'd not have rested better that Night than she did. A little after this, there came Company to visit my Lady, which, according to the nauseous Country-fashion, stay'd till the Evening, and yet we thought our selves happy that we were so easily rid of 'em then, since, according to the custom of the Country, they might have prolong'd their Visit till the next Day; but they were so civil, as not to do it; so that Madam the Marquiese and I found our selves at liberty. In the Evening we went again to the Park, and the Conversation began as it ended before, of our System: My Lady Marquiese had comprehended 'em so well, that she wou'd not be at the pains to re-assume any thing of what had pass'd, but press'd me to lead her to something that was new. Well, said I, since the Sun, which is now immoveable, and no longer a Planet; and that the Earth, that moves round the Sun, is now one, be not surpriz'd if I tell you, the Moon is another Earth, and is, by all appearance, inhabited. Said she, I never heard of the Moon's being inhabited, but as a Fable. So it may be still, said I; I concern my self no further in these Matters, than Men use to do in Civil Wars; where the Uncertainty of what may be, makes People still entertain a Correspondence with the adverse Party: As for me, tho' I see the Moon inhabited, I live very civilly with those that do not believe it; and I carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, upon occasion, with Honour go over to their side who have the better; but still they gain some considerable Advantage over us. I'll tell you my Reasons that make me take part with the Inhabitants of the Moon: Suppose then, there had never been any Commerce between Paris and St. Denis, and that a Citizen of Paris, who had never been out of that City, shou'd go up to the top of the Steeple of our Lady, and shou'd view St. Denis at a distance, and one shou'd ask him if he believ'd St. Denis to be inhabited; he wou'd answer boldly, Not at all; for (he wou'd say) I see the Inhabitants of Paris, but I do not see those of St. Denis, nor ever heard of 'em. It may be, some body standing by, wou'd represent to him, That it was true, one cou'd not see the Inhabitants of St. Denis from our Lady's Church, but that the distance was the cause of it; yet that all we cou'd see of St. Denis, was very like to Paris; for St. Denis had Steeples, Houses and Walls; and that it might resemble Paris in every thing else, and be inhabited as well as it. All these Arguments wou'd not prevail upon my Citizen; who wou'd continue still obstinate in maintaining, that St. Denis was not inhabited, because he saw none of the People. The Moon is our St. Denis, and we the Citizens of Paris, that never went out of our own Town. Ah, interrupted the Marquiese, you do us wrong; we are not so foolish as your Citizens of Paris: Since he sees that St. Denis is so like to Paris in every thing, he must have lost his Reason, if he did not think it was inhabited: But for the Moon, that's nothing like the Earth. Have a care, Madam, said I, what you say; for if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth, you are oblig'd to believe that the Moon is inhabited. I acknowledge, said she, if you do that, I must yield; and your Looks are so assur'd, that you frighten me already: The two different Motions of the Earth, which wou'd never have enter'd into my Thoughts, make me very apprehensive of all you say. But is it possible that the Earth can be an enlighten'd Body, as the Moon is? For, to resemble it, it must be so. Alas, Madam, said I, to be enlightned, is not so great a matter as you imagine, and the Sun only is remarkable for that Quality: 'tis he alone that is enlightned of himself, by virtue of his particular Essence; but the other Planets shine only, as being enlightned by the Sun: The Sun communicates his Light to the Moon, which reflects it upon the Earth; as the Earth, without doubt, reflects it back again to the Moon, since the distance from the Moon to the Earth is the same as from the Earth to the Moon.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P018: AS soon as one could get into my Lady Marquiese's Apartment, I sent to know how she did, and how she had slept that Night in turning round.

I'll tell you my Reasons that make me take part with the Inhabitants of the Moon: Suppose then, there had never been any Commerce between Paris and St. Denis, and that a Citizen of Paris, who had never been out of that City, shou'd go up to the top of the Steeple of our Lady, and shou'd view St. Denis at a distance, and one shou'd ask him if he believ'd St. Denis to be inhabited; he wou'd answer boldly, Not at all; for (he wou'd say) I see the Inhabitants of Paris, but I do not see those of St. Denis, nor ever heard of 'em. It may be, some body standing by, wou'd represent to him, That it was true, one cou'd not see the Inhabitants of St. Denis from our Lady's Church, but that the distance was the cause of it; yet that all we cou'd see of St. Denis, was very like to Paris; for St. Denis had Steeples, Houses and Walls; and that it might resemble Paris in every thing else, and be inhabited as well as it. All these Arguments wou'd not prevail upon my Citizen; who wou'd continue still obstinate in maintaining, that St. Denis was not inhabited, because he saw none of the People. The Moon is our St. Denis, and we the Citizens of Paris, that never went out of our own Town. Ah, interrupted the Marquiese, you do us wrong; we are not so foolish as your Citizens of Paris: Since he sees that St. Denis is so like to Paris in every thing, he must have lost his Reason, if he did not think it was inhabited: But for the Moon, that's nothing like the Earth. Have a care, Madam, said I, what you say; for if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth, you are oblig'd to believe that the Moon is inhabited. I acknowledge, said she, if you do that, I must yield; and your Looks are so assur'd, that you frighten me already: The two different Motions of the Earth, which wou'd never have enter'd into my Thoughts, make me very apprehensive of all you say. But is it possible that the Earth can be an enlighten'd Body, as the Moon is? For, to resemble it, it must be so. Alas, Madam, said I, to be enlightned, is not so great a matter as you imagine, and the Sun only is remarkable for that Quality: 'tis he alone that is enlightned of himself, by virtue of his particular Essence; but the other Planets shine only, as being enlightned by the Sun: The Sun communicates his Light to the Moon, which reflects it upon the Earth; as the Earth, without doubt, reflects it back again to the Moon, since the distance from the Moon to the Earth is the same as from the Earth to the Moon.</p>","explanations":["The French source describes the philosopher's cautious stance in intellectual debates using the general phrasing 'je me tiens toujours en état de me pouvoir ranger à leur opinion avec honneur, si elle avoit le dessus' (I always keep myself in a state to be able to align with their opinion with honor, if it gained the upper hand). The English translation renders this as 'I carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, upon occasion, with Honour go over to their side who have the better'. The adverb 'trimmingly' is a significant domestication. In late 17th-century England, particularly during the 1680s (the period of this translation), a 'trimmer' was a specific and highly recognizable political term referring to someone who steered a middle course between opposing factions (like Whigs and Tories) or shifted allegiance, famously discussed in Halifax's 'The Character of a Trimmer'. By using 'trimmingly', the translator adapts the philosopher's general intellectual prudence to a specific, contemporary English socio-political concept. This makes the philosopher's behavior resonate with the target audience's understanding of political maneuvering in their own volatile context, thus domesticating the original's more general metaphor of caution in 'Civil Wars' by framing it through a distinctively English political lens."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere du Soleil? Je vous vois toûjours, pour la Lune, repris-je, un reste d'estime dont vous ne sauriez vous défaire. La lumiere est composée de petites balles qui bondissent sur ce qui est solide, &amp; retournent d'un autre côté, au lieu qu'elles passent au travers de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">ce qui leur presente des ouvertures en ligne droite</span></span>, comme l'air ou le verre. Ainsi ce qui fait que la Lune nous éclaire, c'est qu'elle est un Corps dur &amp; solide, qui nous renvoye ces petites balles. Or je croy que vous ne contesterez pas à la Terre cette même dureté e&amp; cette même solidité. Admirez donc ce que c'est que d'être posté avantageusement. Parce que la Lune est éloignée de nous, nous ne la voyons que comme un Corps lumineux, &amp; nous ignorons que ce soit une grosse masse, toute semblable à la Terre. Au contraire, parce que la Terre a le malheur que nous la voyons de trop prés, elle ne nous paroît qu'une grosse masse, propre seulement à fournir de la pâture aux Animaux, &amp; nous ne nous apercevons pas qu'elle est lumineuse, faute de nous pouvoir mettre à quelque distance d'elle. Cela va de la même maniere, dit la Marquise, que quand nous sommes frapés de l'éclat des Conditions; élevées au-dessus des nôtres, &amp; que nous ne voyons pas, qu'au fond elles se ressemblent toutes extrêmement. </p><p>P025: C'est la même chose, répondis-je.

Je ne me consoleray jamais, dit-elle, de l'injustice que nous faisons à la Terre, &amp; de la préoccupation trop favorable où nous sommes pour la Lune, si vous ne m'assurez que les Gens de la Lune ne connaissent pas mieux leurs avantages que nous connoissons les nôtres, &amp; qu'ils prennent notre Terre pour un Astre, sans savoir que leur habitation en est un aussi. Pour cela, repris-je, je vous le garantis. Nous leur paraissons faire assez regulièrement nos fonctions d'Astres. Il est vray qu'ils ne nous voyent pas décrire un Cercle autour d'eux; mais il n'importe, voicy ce que c'est. La moitié de la Lune qui se trouva tournée vers nous au commencement du Monde, y a toûjours eté tournée depuis; elle ne nous présente jamais que ces yeux, cette bouche, &amp; le reste de ce visage que notre imagination luy compose sur le fondement des tâches qu'elle nous montre. Si l'autre moitié opposée se presentoit à nous, d'autres tâches differemment arrangées, nous feroient sans doute imaginer quelque autre figure. Ce n'est pas que la Lune ne tourne sur elle-même, elle y tourne en autant de temps qu'autour de la Terre, c'est à dire, en un mois; mais lors qu'elle fait une partie de ce tremblement, &amp; de s'imaginer que nous avons dans le Ciel comme un mouvement de Pendule qui va &amp; vient. </p><p>P026: Toutes ces Planètes, dit la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">sont faites comme nous,</span></span> qui rejetons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mêmes. La Terre dit: Ce n'est pas moy qui tourne, c'est le Soleil. La Lune dit, _Ce n'est pas moy qui tremble, c'est la Terre. Il y a bien de l'erreur par tout. Je ne vous conseille pas d'entreprendre d'y rien réformer, répondis-je, il vaut mieux que vous acheviez de vous convaincre de l'entiere ressemblance de la Terre &amp; de la Lune. Représentez-vous <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">ces deux grandes Boules</span></span> suspendües dans les Cieux. Vous savez que le Soleil éclaire toûjours une moitié des Corps qui sont ronds, &amp; que l'autre moitié est dans l'ombre. Il y a donc toûjours une moitié, tant de la Terre que de la Lune, qui est éclairée du Soleil, c'est à dire, qui a le jour, &amp; une autre moitié qui est dans la nuit. Remarquez d'ailleurs que comme une Balle a moins de force &amp; de vitesse après qu'elle a été donner contre une muraille qui l'a renvoyée d'un autre côté, de même la lumière s'affoiblit lors qu'elle a été réfléchie par quelque Corps. Cette lumière blanchâtre qui nous vient de la Lune, est la lumière même du Soleil, mais elle ne peut venir de la Lune à nous que par une réflexion. Elle a donc beaucoup perdu de la force &amp; de la vivacité qu'elle avoit lorsqu'elle étoit receüe directement sur la Lune, &amp; cette lumière éclatante que nous recevons du Soleil &amp; que la Terre reflechit sur la Lune, ne doit plus être qu'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée. Ainsi ce qui nous paroit lumineux dans la Lune, &amp; qui nous éclaire pendant nos nuits, ce sont des parties de la Lune qui ont le jour; &amp; les parties de la Terre qui ont le jour lors qu'elles sont tournées vers les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit les éclairent aussi. Tout dépend de la manière dont la Lune &amp; la Terre se regardent. Dans les premiers jours du mois que l'on ne voit pas la Lune, c'est qu'elle est entre le Soleil &amp; nous, &amp; qu'elle marche de jour avec le Soleil. Il faut necessairement que toute sa moitié qui a le jour, soit tournée vers le Soleil, &amp; que toute sa moitié qui a la nuit, soit tournée vers nous. Nous n'avons garde de voir cette moitié qui n'a aucune lumière pour se faire voir. Mais cette moitié de la Lune qui a la nuit, étant tournée vers la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, nous voit sans être veüe, &amp; nous voit sous la même figure que nous voyons la Pleine Lune. C'est alors pour les Gens de la Lune Pleine Terre, s'il est permis de parler ainsi. Ensuite la Lune qui avance sur son Cercle d'un mois, se dégage de dessous le Soleil, &amp; commence à tourner vers nous un petit coin de sa moitié éclairée, &amp; voilà le Croissant. Alors aussi les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit commencent à ne plus voir toute la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, &amp; nous sommes en Décours pour elles.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P019: But, said the Marquiese, is the Earth as proper for reflecting the Light of the Sun, as the Moon?

The English translation renders this description and then adds the learned, Greek-derived technical term 'Diaphanus' (glossed as 'or clear'). Fontenelle was known for making science accessible through simple language. The introduction of 'Diaphanus' adapts the text by elevating its scientific register, aligning it with a more formal, scholarly style of discourse that might have been expected or valued by the English educated readership of the time, thereby transforming the original's stylistic simplicity.","The French phrase 'nous sommes toûjours dans un mauvais point de veüe' (literally 'we are always in a bad point of view' or 'wrong perspective') is translated using the established English idiom 'to be plac'd in a false Light'. This substitution adapts the original expression to a common and vivid English idiom, making the text sound more natural and conventional to the target audience and aligning it with target language idiomatic norms.","The French source uses the general pronoun 'nous' (us) in the phrase 'sont faites comme nous,' (are made like us,). The English translation specifies this as 'are like us Mortals,'. The addition of 'Mortals,' a term often used in English literary and philosophical contexts of the period to refer to human beings, especially emphasizing their nature or frailty, adapts the tone. It aligns the Marquise's reflection with English stylistic conventions for such observations, possibly making it resonate more familiarly with target readers accustomed to this qualifier in moralizing or philosophical discussions.","The French source uses the common, everyday word 'Boules' (balls) to refer to the Earth and Moon. The English translation substitutes this with 'Globes,' a more formal and specifically scientific term in English when referring to celestial bodies. This lexical choice elevates the register of the text, adapting it to the more formal or learned style generally expected in English scientific or astronomical discussions of that period, thereby making the description conform to target culture norms for such topics."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je saurai tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.

This domesticates the text by simplifying a potentially unfamiliar foreign cultural element (a Lunarian term/concept), making the idea more immediately accessible to the target reader but losing the nuance of a distinct Lunarian viewpoint or nomenclature.","The French source expresses the Marquise's concern about being reproached for having a simple thing explained to her at length: \"qu'il me fût reproché de m'être fait expliquer tout au long une chose si aisée.\" The English translation reframes the grounds for this reproach by explicitly adding the notion of intellectual deficiency: \"reproach me with the want of so much Sence.\" This domesticates the text by adapting the Marquise's social anxiety into terms of intellectual capacity (\"Sence\"), a concept readily understood and valued in the English cultural context of the time. This makes her motivation more explicit and perhaps more relatable to target readers by aligning it with familiar cultural valuations of intelligence and understanding.","The Marquise's French question regarding eclipses, \"comment vont-elles?\" (literally \"how do they go?\" or broadly \"what about them?\"), is a somewhat informal and general inquiry. The English translation renders this as \"What is the Cause of them?\", a more formal, specific, and scientifically-oriented question focused on causality. This domestication aligns the dialogue with the prevailing empirical and rationalist spirit of the Scientific Revolution influential in England. It adapts the Marquise's curiosity to a mode of inquiry perhaps deemed more appropriate or recognizable for a work of scientific popularization aimed at an English audience increasingly familiar with natural philosophy's emphasis on causes.","The philosopher's French response, \"Il ne tient qu'à vous de le deviner, répondis-je\" (\"It's up to you to guess it\" or \"You are quite capable of figuring it out\"), is encouraging and polite, fitting the gallant tone of Fontenelle's work. The English translation, \"If you do not understand that, said I, 'tis your own fault,\" is starkly different, adopting a harsh, direct, and accusatory tone. This significant alteration domesticates the dialogue by transforming the philosopher's persona and the pedagogical dynamic. It possibly aligns the interaction with different, perhaps more severe or didactic, cultural expectations in England regarding authoritative discourse or teacher-student relationships, thereby moving away from Fontenelle's characteristic urbane charm and accessibility."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P028: Je suis fort étonnée, dit la Marquise, qu'il y ait si peu de mystere aux Eclipses, &amp; que tout le monde n'en devine pas la cause.

The translation pluralizes it to 'certain Demons' and adds 'or Spirits,' generalizing the entity into a broader, perhaps more familiar category of malevolent supernatural beings for the English audience, thereby reducing its cultural specificity.","The French 'tres propre à obtenir' (very suitable/apt for obtaining) describes the perceived efficacy of the posture. The English translation introduces 'thinking that most devout posture,' interpreting the action through a Christian/Western lens of 'devotion,' a concept more readily understood by the target audience as a motivator for such a ritualistic act.","The French 'des Magiciennes' specifies female magicians or sorceresses. The English translation changes this to the singular 'the Magician,' which in the English of the period often defaulted to a male figure or was at least gender-neutral, thus erasing the specific gendered element of the original and simplifying the image.","The French 'Arrêt' refers to a decree or edict, a legal instrument common in the French absolutist system. The translation 'a Law made by universal Consent' re-frames this concept using terminology that would resonate more with English political discourse of the late 17th century, which emphasized ideas of consent and parliamentary law-making, particularly contrasting with French governance.","The original French text has the Marquise explicitly recall and apply the specific Earthly examples of superstitious fears (Indians, Americans, Greeks) to the hypothetical inhabitants of the Moon. The English translation generalizes these specific parallels to 'some of 'em,' 'others,' and 'some,' thereby simplifying the analogical reasoning and reducing the direct rhetorical link to previously discussed cultural examples. This transformation streamlines the text but lessens the pointedness of its comparative satire.","The French 'Messieurs de la Lune' (Gentlemen of the Moon) uses a polite and somewhat formal French term of address which carries social nuances and a touch of irony. The English translation 'the Inhabitants of the Moon' is a more neutral and generic term, stripping away the culturally specific French mode of address and its associated connotations.","The French text includes the philosopher's concluding remark, '& que nous sommes à genoux les uns devant les autres' (and that we are kneeling before each other), powerfully illustrating the mutual and reciprocal nature of the superstitious worship between Earthlings and hypothetical Lunarians. The English translation omits this poignant phrase entirely, thereby weakening the satirical point about shared human (and extraterrestrial) folly and eliminating a striking image of reciprocal absurdity.","The French 'donner des crises à ses Malades' suggests that the Moon actively causes or precipitates critical turning points ('crises') in illnesses, reflecting a belief in direct physical influence. The English 'to give a Judgment on their Distempers' shifts this to a more interpretive or prognostic role, as if the Moon's influence is in allowing a 'judgment' or diagnosis to be made about illnesses. This adaptation makes the superstitious belief sound less like direct causation and more like a basis for (pseudo-)scholarly interpretation, potentially aligning it more with forms of astrological prediction familiar or palatable to the target culture."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P032: Et quelles sont ces Nouvelles seures? interrompit-elle.

While the philosopher is indeed addressing the Marquise throughout the dialogues, the insertion of \"Madam\" here explicitly marks this and conforms more closely to English conversational norms of politeness for the period, particularly when a gentleman addresses a lady of high rank. This stylistic adaptation makes the dialogue feel more natural and conventional to an English-speaking audience of the late 17th century.","The French \"des Abîmes très profonds\" translates to \"very deep abysses\" or \"very deep chasms,\" describing profound and potentially formidable geological features. The English translation substitutes this with \"deep Valleys.\" \"Valleys\" are a more common, generally gentler, and more familiar terrestrial feature compared to \"abysses\" or \"chasms.\" This choice domesticates the description of the alien lunar or planetary landscape by making it sound more akin to Earth's known topography.

The translation 'Valleys' domesticates this by substituting a more common and less extreme geographical term. This makes the lunar landscape sound more familiar and akin to Earth's topography, reducing its alien nature for the target English reader and aligning it with more conventional landscape features.","The French 'des Terres' translates literally to 'lands' or 'earths,' referring to general landmasses. The English translation 'Countries' domesticates this by evoking the concept of distinct regions, similar to how territories are organized or perceived on Earth. This subtly imposes a more structured, Earth-centric organizational framework onto the lunar surface, making its geography more readily comprehensible and familiar to the target audience by likening it to known terrestrial divisions.","The French source uses 'Galilée,' the standard French name for the astronomer Galileo Galilei. The English translation 'Galileus' domesticates this by employing a Latinized form of the name. This adaptation aligns with the common practice in English scholarly and scientific texts of the period, which often used Latinate names for prominent European figures, thus making the reference more familiar and conventional to the target English learned audience and reducing the foreignness of the French form.","The French 'le Monts Porphirites' refers to 'Porphyritic Mountains' or 'Mountains of Porphyry.' The translation 'Porphory-Hills' domesticates the original term by first anglicizing the geological term 'Porphirites' to 'Porphory,' and second, by downscaling 'Monts' (Mountains) to 'Hills.'

N'y eût-il que vous, Madame, repris-je en badinant, vous y avez fait aller tous ceux qu'on vous a adressez, & c'est dequoy faire dans la Lune un amas considerable. Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin. C'est que les Papes ont prétendu être Maîtres de Rome & de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, & la verité est qu'on ne sauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë. Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie. Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres bien conservé. En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus. Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, & qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, & sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, & pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune. Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, & reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, & qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà. Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, & il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, & lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, & si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, & qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, & on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut. En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne. Mais pour achever de m'ôter le mien, dites-moy, & dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune; car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une manière assez positive. Moi, repris- je. Je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune. Voyez combien la face de la Nature est changée d'icy à la Chine; d'autres Visages, d'autres Figures, d'autres Moeurs, & presque d'autres Principes de raisonnement. D'icy à la Lune le changement doit être bien plus considerable. Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine; qui pourrait pousser jusqu'à la Lune, assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit. P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience? De bonne foy, Madame, repliquay-je, je n'en say rien. S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, & que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; & si d'ailleurs nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eût ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures qu'on appelle le Genre humain? Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eût des passions si folles, & des reflexions si sages; une durée si courte, & des veües si longues, tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, & tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, & tant d'inclination à la Servitude; une si forte envie d'être heureux, & une si grande incapacité de l'être? Il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela. Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mêmes, & nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits. On a eté réduit à dire que les Dieux etoient plein de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes, & que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sang froid, ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire. Nous voila donc bien en seureté du côté des Gens de la Lune, dit la Marquise, ils ne nous devineront pas; mais je voudrais que nous les pussions deviner, car en verité cela inquiete, de savoir qu'ils sont là-haut, dans cette Lune que nous voyons, & de ne pouvoir pas se figurer comment ils sont faits. Et pourquoi, rêpondis-je, n'avez-vous point d'inquietude sur les Habitans de cette grande Terre Australe qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe? Nous sommes portés eux & nous sur un même Vaisseau dont ils occupent la Proüe, & nous la Pouppe. Vous voyez que de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, & qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font, & vous voudriez savoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux? P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, & qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, & ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, & je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre & la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, & les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, & au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, & alloient terre à terre portez par le vent & par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, & à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté & de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange & le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, & qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, & tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune & la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique & l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air & de Ciel qui est entre la Terre & la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, & de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, & il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, & qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, & quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, & nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles & plus experimentez, nous les verrons, & Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; & du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, & beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, & dans des Païs très chauds, & dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, & qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, & puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, & la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, & qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. Ah! vous me soulagez, répliqua la Marquise, votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, & me faisoit mal, & je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. ","manualHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of.</p> <p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse.</p> <p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</p> <p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</p> <p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","aiHtml":"P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of. P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse. P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips. P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine. P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">TROISIEME SOIR.

The English translation, 'The Third Night.', omits the descriptive subtitle 'Particularités du monde de la Lune.' This omission is a clear instance of domestication. It simplifies the chapter heading by eliminating a significant descriptive component. This adaptation likely aims to conform to English literary conventions of the period, which may have favored more concise or less overtly didactic chapter titles compared to the French style of providing detailed topical information directly in headings. By removing this part of the title, the translator makes the text's structure appear less 'foreign' and potentially more streamlined for the target English-speaking audience, though it also removes the explicit guidance about the chapter's content that Fontenelle provided in the original paratext."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P039: La Marquise voulut megager pendant le jour à poursuivre nos Entretiens, mais je luy representay que nous ne devions confier nos chimeres qu'à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles, puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet. Nous ne manquâmes pas à aller le soir dans le Parc, qui devenoit un lieu consacré à nos Conversations savantes. </p><p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences êtoit habitée, pourroit bien ne l'être point; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril. Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paie point de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">Sentences</span></span>, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">voilà le malheur</span></span>. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune; conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">l'action du Soleil sur elles</span></span>; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent</span></span>, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance. Cela nous fournira des fruits, des blés, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons. J'entends des fruits, des bleds, des eaux à la maniere de la Lune que je fais profession de ne pas connoître, le tout proportionné aux besoins de ses Habitans, que je ne connais pas non plus. </p><p>P041: C'est-à-dire, me dit la Marquise, que vous savez seulement que tout est bien, sans savoir comment il est; c'est beaucoup d'ignorance sur bien peu de science; mais il faut s'en consoler; je suis encore trop heureuse que vous ayez rendu à la Lune ses Habitans. Je suis même fort contente que vous luy donniez un Air qui l'enveloppe en son particulier, il me semblerait desormais que sans cela une Planete seroit trop nuë.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P031: MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but I told her, 'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them. We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, as the Earth is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change; there lies the difficulty: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are at from the Moon. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination and a Kindness for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling. It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon (for certainly it emits Vapours;) and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain: And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence; so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, with a little Knowledge; but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but I told her, 'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them. We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">fair Words</span></span>; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, as the Earth is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">there lies the difficulty</span></span>: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are at from the Moon. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination and a Kindness for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling.

This domesticates the original by replacing a potentially more specific or formal term with a colloquial and readily understood English idiom, making the Marquise's retort flow naturally while subtly shifting the nuance from a dismissal of abstract/formal talk to a dismissal of potentially deceptive or empty talk.","The French \"voilà le malheur\" (literally \"there is the misfortune\" or \"that's the unfortunate part\") carries an emotional or dramatic connotation when identifying a problem in the reasoning. The English translation \"there lies the difficulty\" is more neutral, analytical, and objective. This domestication tones down the original's expressiveness, aligning it with a potentially more sober or conventionally \"scientific\" or \"philosophical\" tone that might have been preferred in English intellectual discourse of the period for popular science.","The original French \"l'action du Soleil sur elles\" (the action of the Sun on them) is a general phrase. The English translation expands and specifies this to \"the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em\". This introduces more specific scientific concepts ('attracting,' 'moving Influence') that were becoming prominent in England around the time of Isaac Newton's work on gravity (Principia Mathematica published 1687). This is a domestication that updates and adapts the scientific language to reflect the contemporary scientific understanding and terminology of the target culture, making the text more immediately relevant and sophisticated to an English reader familiar with these emerging ideas.","The French phrase \"voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent\" (literally \"there, its inhabitants are reborn/come back to life!\") is a vivid, imaginative, and metaphorical expression highlighting the revival of the possibility of lunar inhabitants. The English translation \"which furnish it with Inhabitants\" (referring to the causes) is considerably more prosaic, functional, and lacks the dramatic and literary flair of the original. This domestication transforms a striking literary image into a more matter-of-fact statement, potentially to make the philosopher's speculative conclusion sound less fanciful and more aligned with a reserved or utilitarian style for such discussions in the target culture."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empêcher la communication des deux Planetes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">S'il ne tenoit qu'à voler</span></span>; que savons-nous, comme je vous disois hier, si <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">on ne volera pas fort bien quelque jour</span></span>?

This substitution of a source language construction with a common target language idiom makes the text more colloquial and familiar to an English reader, an instance of idiomatic domestication.","The French \"on ne volera pas fort bien quelque jour\" literally translates to \"one will not fly very well someday\" or more idiomatically \"whether one will fly very well someday.\" The translation \"we might come to perfection in that Art\" elevates the simpler idea of \"flying very well\" to achieving \"perfection in that Art.\" This rephrasing adapts the original concept to align with Enlightenment ideals of human progress and the mastery of skills (referred to as \"Arts\"), making the concept more resonant with the intellectual and cultural aspirations prevalent in the target culture of the time.","Fontenelle metaphorically describes water as \"l'air des Poissons\" (the air of fish).

This adaptation makes the scientific analogy more familiar and intellectually accessible by grounding it in established target culture scientific-philosophical terminology.","Similar to the previous point, Fontenelle refers to the medium of birds as \"l'Air des Oiseaux\" (the Air of Birds). The translator consistently expands this to \"the Air and Element of Birds.\" This addition of \"and Element\" reinforces the connection to the classical elemental theory, aligning Fontenelle's description with a familiar scientific framework for the English readership and thereby domesticating the concept.","The French \"se noyeroit\" (would drown) is used by Fontenelle to describe the fate of a Moon inhabitant entering Earth's thicker atmosphere. While \"drown\" can be used metaphorically for asphyxiation in a non-liquid medium, the translator adds \"and suffocated.\" This clarification makes the physiological process more explicit and scientifically precise according to the understanding of the target audience. It transforms a potentially metaphorical or less specific expression into a more direct and conventionally scientific description, reducing its foreignness or potential ambiguity for the English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P043: Oh, que j'aurois d'envie, s'écria la Marquise, qu'il arrivât quelque grand naufrage qui répandît icy bon nombre de ces Gens- là, dont nous irions considérer à notre aise les figures extraordinaires!

This domestication replaces a somewhat general French term with a precise, contemporary English technical equivalent, making the scientific analogy immediately clear and relatable to the target readership.","The French 'leur pureté' (their purity) is amplified in the English translation to 'their Purity and Perfection.' This addition of 'Perfection' creates a rhetorical doublet, a stylistic feature that could align the text with English literary preferences for more ornate or emphatic prose, thereby domesticating the style for the target audience.","The phrase 'd'une autre couleur' (of another colour/a different colour) is translated as 'of an indifferent Colour.' In 17th-century English, 'indifferent' could mean neutral or not having a specific quality. This changes the scientific proposition from the Moon's air having a *different specific* colour to it having a *neutral* or non-colour-imparting quality. This alteration might reflect prevailing scientific hypotheses or preferences for more generalized distinctions in the English intellectual context of the time."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy.

This adaptation narrows the general act of coordinating clothing to a specific, fashion-conscious activity (selecting trimmings). This likely aimed to make the Marquise's analogy more concrete and resonant for the English female readership of the period, aligning the concept with target culture's specific social and fashion norms.","The French \"les Lunettes,\" used here metaphorically to mean optical devices that shape perception, is rendered as \"the Perspective-glasses.\" In 17th-century English, \"Perspective-glass\" often referred to a telescope or similar optical instrument. This choice domesticates by specifying the potentially ambiguous French term \"Lunettes\" as a type of scientific instrument known and valorized in the target culture (England during the Scientific Revolution). This makes Nature's metaphorical tools more concrete and aligns them with contemporary English scientific interests and terminology.","The French \"certaines Lunettes\" (certain lenses/glasses, used metaphorically for innate ways of seeing) is translated as \"a Perspective-glass, or Tube.\" Similar to the previous instance, this uses the English term \"Perspective-glass\" (often a telescope) and reinforces it with \"or Tube,\" further specifying the metaphor in terms of scientific optical instruments. This domestication grounds Fontenelle's abstract idea of subjective perception in the tangible technology of the Scientific Revolution, making the concept more accessible and resonant for an English audience fascinated by such devices and their impact on knowledge."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, répliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mêmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

The English translation provides a more detailed and seemingly more 'scientific' account, specifying 'oblique and faint' beams and their lack of 'strength to penetrate' the air. This elaboration domesticates the text by adapting the style of scientific popularization to the likely expectations of an English audience accustomed to the more empirical and detailed scientific discourse of the late 17th century, influenced by the Royal Society and the burgeoning scientific revolution in England.","The French phrase 'par dessus ce qui nous est dû' (over and above what is owed to us), qualifying Nature's gift of twilight as an extra, implies a deliberate, benevolent benefit. The English translation replaces this with 'by the by, or, as it were, by chance,' suggesting an incidental or accidental occurrence. This conceptual shift domesticates the original by downplaying Nature's deliberate benevolence, possibly to align with more mechanistic philosophical views or to neutralize language with theological echoes of 'grace' that might be differently interpreted within the predominantly Protestant English target culture of the late 17th century.","Fontenelle's explanation of rainbow formation is brief ('forms in the clouds from which rain falls'). The English translation significantly elaborates, introducing more detailed contemporary scientific concepts such as 'Exhalations and Vapours, condens'd into black Clouds' and 'by divers Reflections and Refections of the Sun-beams'. This domesticates the text by adapting the scientific explanation to the more detailed and empirical standards of scientific discourse prevalent in late 17th-century England, particularly aligning with the growing influence of Newtonian optics and the scientific ethos of the Royal Society.","The French 'les Belles de ce Pays-là' (the Beauties of that country/world) is a general term for beautiful women, a common subject for poetic comparisons in French gallant literature. The English translation rephrases the concept to focus on 'the Lovers in the Moon compare their Mistresses'. This domesticates the original by adapting the reference to the common motif and terminology of 'Lovers' and 'Mistresses' prevalent in 17th-century English love poetry and social discourse, making the idea more familiar and aligned with target culture literary conventions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P048: Je n'aurois pas grand regret à ces comparaisons là, dit la Marquise, &amp; je trouve qu'on est assez bien recompense dans la Lune, de n'avoir ny Aurore ny Arc-en- ciel, car on ne doit avoir par la même raison ny Foudres ny Tonnerres, puisque ce sont aussi des choses qui se forment dans les nüages.

They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another. You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other?

Well, said she, what hinders, but we shou'd make a Journey through the Planets as well as we can? Let us by imagination place our selves in several Positions, and situations, fit for considering the Universe. Have we no more to see in the Moon? No, said I, at least, I have shown you all I know. Going out of the Moon towards the Sun, the first Planet you meet with is Venus; and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis.

Ay, but interrupted the Marquiese by your why nots, you will people all the Planets. Do not doubt of it, Madam, answer'd I; why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all? We see that all the Planets are of the same Nature, that they are all Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun; which they send one to another by Reflection, and that they have all the same kind of motion; thus far equal, and after all this must we conceive that all these vast Bodies were made not to be inhabited? And that Nature has made only an exception in Favor of the Earth, he that will believe this, may, but for my part I cannot. I find you, said the Marquiese, very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited. It is true, Madam, in the minute wherein you have surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me, as to the Inhabitants of all the Planets, I wou'd not only have defended my opinion, but have proceeded, to have given you an exact description of all the several Inhabitants of the Planets. There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it. The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there. And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates. If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,) and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures. Several Bodies, which appear to be solid, are nothing else but Collections or little heaps of these imperceptible Animals; who find there as much room, as is requisite for them to move in. The leaf of a Tree, is a little World inhabited, by such invisible little Worms: To them this leaf seems of a vast Extent, they find Hills and Valleys upon it: And there is no more Communication between the living Creatures on the one side, and those on the other, than between us and the Antipodes. And I think there is more reason, to believe a Planet (which is so vast a Body) to be inhabited. There has been found in several sorts of very hard Stones, infinite multitudes of little Worms, lodg'd all over them in insensible varieties; and who are nourish'd upon the Substance of these Stones which they eat. Consider the vast Numbers of these little Animals, and how long a tract of Years they have liv'd upon a grain of Sand. And by this Argument, tho my Moon were nothing but a confus'd heap of Marble Rocks, I wou'd rather make it be devour'd and consum'd by its Inhabitants, than to place none at all in it.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P036: I do much regret that loss, said the Marquiese, for in my Opinion, the Inhabitants of the Moon are fully recompens'd for the want of the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light, since for the same Reason, they have neither Thunder nor Lightning, both which are produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations; they enjoy bright serene Days, and never lose the Sun by Day, nor the Stars by Night. They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">Rome, which is built under ground</span></span>, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another. You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">merited Happiness by their good Life in this World</span></span>; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other?

The English translation explicitly clarifies this as \"Rome, which is built under ground,\" transforming a potentially less familiar or more specialized term for the target audience into a more direct and accessible description, thereby reducing its foreignness.","The French \"je reprens le Saint-Denis\" is a concise, almost idiomatic reference to a previous comparison involving Saint-Denis (a town near Paris). The English translation explicitly spells this out as \"my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis.\" This expansion makes the reference more transparent for an English audience who might not share the same immediate cultural or textual familiarity as the French readership, thus domesticating the source text's stylistic conciseness and reliance on implicit understanding. It makes the text more accessible but potentially flattens the original's specific literary charm.","The French \"merité icy d'être bien-heureuses\" (merited here/in this world to be blessed/very happy) is translated with an added explanatory phrase \"by their good Life\". This addition clarifies the implicit condition for achieving happiness in the afterlife (residence on the Moon), making the moral framework more explicit for the target audience. This adaptation aims for greater accessibility and potentially aligns the concept with common moral understandings in the target culture.","The French text uses \"Ciron,\" an old French term for a tiny mite or insect. The English translation replaces it with \"Mite,\" a common and readily understandable English equivalent. This substitution domesticates the text by replacing a specific, potentially obscure French lexical item with a familiar target language term, enhancing accessibility for the English reader.","The French \"Lunettes\" (literally 'glasses' or 'eyepieces') is used here in the context of viewing microscopic organisms. The English translation not only clarifies this by specifying \"Glasses call'd Microscopes\" but also adds the phrase \"The late invention of\" before it and completes the thought with \"have discover'd\" (corresponding to the French \"On a vu\"). This addition frames the reference within the context of recent, exciting scientific advancements familiar to the English public of the late 17th century, thereby domesticating the source by explicitly connecting it to the target culture's contemporary scientific awareness and making the discovery more vivid and relatable.","The French source speaks generally of mixing \"certaines choses\" (certain things) into liquids. The English translation domesticates this by providing a concrete, everyday example: \"(as Pepper in Water,)\". This addition, not present in the original, makes the scientific concept more accessible and relatable to the target audience by grounding it in a familiar, practical illustration, aligning with the goal of popularization for a general readership.","The French \"des Montagnes & des Abîmes\" (mountains and abysses/chasms) used to describe the micro-topography of a leaf is translated as \"Hills and Valleys.\" While \"abyss\" exists in English, the choice of \"Valleys\" alongside \"Hills\" creates a more conventional and perhaps gentler image of a miniature landscape. This domesticates the imagery by replacing a potentially more dramatic or less common metaphorical term (\"Abîmes\") with a more familiar and standard topographical term (\"Valleys\"), making the description more readily accessible and less stark for the target reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P051: Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë, dit la Marquise, mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planètes, &amp; embarrassée de la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux; car je voy bien que la Nature, selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela?

This adaptation frames Fontenelle's idea of distinct groups in terms more aligned with emerging English discourses on human classification and diversity, potentially making it more resonant or comprehensible within the target culture's conceptual framework.","The French \"le raisonnement se forme entierement par l'experience\" (reason is formed entirely by experience) is translated as \"our Reason is form'd and made perfect by Experience.\" The addition of \"and made perfect\" introduces a teleological dimension not explicitly present in the original, suggesting that experience not only shapes reason but brings it to an ideal state. This adaptation subtly aligns the concept with potentially stronger notions of human perfectibility through empiricism, which might have been a particular emphasis within the English Enlightenment context, thus domesticating the idea to target cultural values.","The French \"on s'ennuye\" (one gets bored/is bored) is a relatively neutral description of a state. The English translation \"which must render their Lives very irksom\" interprets and intensifies this state, framing it as an inevitable and highly negative condition (\"must render,\" \"very irksom\"). This transformation adapts the concept to resonate more strongly with target culture sensibilities, possibly reflecting a greater emphasis on purposefulness or a stronger aversion to ennui as a state detrimental to a fulfilling life, making the consequence more impactful for English readers.","The French \"entre les hommes\" (among men/humankind) is rendered in the broader phrase as part of \"to us Mortals,\" a common literary shift in English that can add a layer of solemnity. More significantly, \"la distribution du bonheur où des talens\" (the distribution of happiness or talents) is transformed into \"by making some happy, others miserable.\" This domesticates Fontenelle's more nuanced philosophical point about the varied allocation of positive attributes by simplifying it into a starker, more dramatic binary of outcomes. This polarization aligns the idea with common moral or narrative tropes potentially more familiar or accessible to the English readership of the period."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">en quittant le ton serieux</span></span>?

It alters the mood of the interaction, making it more formal.","The French source has the Marquise state her inability to articulate her imaginative visions ('I could not describe them to you'), highlighting the abstract and novel nature of the concepts. The English translation reverses this to 'I can describe 'em to you,' portraying her as more confident and capable of immediately grasping and verbalizing these ideas. This domestication adapts the Marquise's character, possibly to present her as a more readily intelligent and receptive figure to the target English audience, thereby making the popularization effort appear more successful or aligning her with an ideal of female quick-wittedness, at the cost of a more nuanced psychological portrayal of grappling with new thoughts.","In the original French, the philosopher advises the Marquise ('I advise you') to entrust the 'care' or 'task' ('le soin') of developing the imagined figures to her dreams ('aux Songes que vous aurez cette nuit' - to the Dreams you will have tonight), suggesting a creative or formative role for dreaming. The English translation alters this: the philosopher takes direct action ('I leave these shapes'), and the purpose assigned to dreams shifts from 'le soin' (implying work or development) to providing 'entertainment' ('to entertain you in Dreams this Night'). This domestication changes the philosopher's speech act from pedagogical advice to a more gallant statement and simplifies the role of dreams to passive amusement rather than active imaginative work. This may align the dialogue with target culture expectations for polite conversation or a less psychologically complex view of imagination."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P054: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">QUATRIEME SOIR.

The English translation expands on this by inserting the explanatory clause 'for they being ignorant of drawing, and designing' before rendering the original idea as 'and pleasing themselves with their extravagant and grotesque Figures'. This addition domesticates the text by attributing the foreign artistic practice and consequent critique of European realism to a lack of skill in (presumably Western/European) 'drawing, and designing'. This reframes the source's more neutral presentation of differing artistic perspectives into one based on a presumed technical deficiency, an interpretation that would likely align with or reinforce the artistic values and potential ethnocentric assumptions of the late 17th-century English target audience, a culture increasingly valuing empirical observation and realistic representation.","The French source uses the standard aristocratic title 'la Marquise'. The English translation, in this instance from 'dis-je à la Marquise' becoming 'said I to my Lady Marquiese', consistently uses 'my Lady Marquiese'. The addition of 'my Lady' is a specifically English form of addressing a noblewoman (Marquise being the rank). This adapts the French social address to an English socio-cultural equivalent, making the character's title conform to English norms for addressing nobility. This is a form of domestication as it reduces the foreignness of the French title, assimilating the character more smoothly into the target culture's social framework and making her mode of address more familiar to English readers of the period.","The French source phrase 'la Terre de dedans Venus paroît' (literally, 'the Earth from within Venus appears') offers a slightly more abstract or generalized perspective on how Earth would be viewed from Venus. The English translation renders this as 'the Earth must necessarily appear to the Inhabitants of Venus', explicitly naming 'the Inhabitants of Venus' as the observers. This transformation makes the concept more concrete and person-focused. This can be seen as domestication because it adapts Fontenelle's original phrasing to be more directly relatable and less abstract, potentially aligning with a target audience's preference for concrete, anthropocentric explanations, especially given the burgeoning popular interest in extraterrestrial life during the early Enlightenment. It shifts the focus from a general vantage point to specific (imagined) observers, arguably making the scientific popularization more accessible but also subtly altering its philosophical tone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: Vous m'affligez, dit la Marquise.

The English translation replaces this with \"the lucky Star of their Intrigues\" when describing the Moon's role for Venusians. This domesticates by shifting the imagery from rustic simplicity to sophisticated, courtly machinations, aligning the concept with themes of amorous intrigues popular in 17th-century English society and making it more resonant with target culture norms of \"gallantry\".","The French \"le menu Peuple\" translates to \"the common people\" or \"ordinary folk.\" The English translation uses \"the very Mobile,\" derived from the Latin \"mobile vulgus\" (the fickle crowd/rabble). This term had specific, often negative, connotations in 17th-century English socio-political discourse, referring to the 'mob'. This choice domesticates by replacing a relatively neutral French descriptor with a term laden with English socio-political implications of the era, potentially reflecting target-culture anxieties about social order.","The French \"un petit Peuple noir, brûlé du Soleil\" (a small, dark/black people, sunburnt) is rendered as \"a sort of little Sun-burnt Gentlemen.\" The addition of \"Gentlemen\" domesticates by elevating the described people's social status to align them with an idealized, refined image of \"gallantry\" likely more appealing to the target English readership, conforming them to target culture social ideals, while the potentially more 'othering' \"noir\" (dark/black) is softened.","The French \"Tournois\" (tournaments), referring to chivalric martial games, is translated as \"Masquerades\" (masked balls). Masquerades were a highly fashionable and contemporary form of entertainment in late 17th-century England, unlike the more archaic tournaments. This substitution domesticates by replacing an older cultural practice with one that was current and immediately recognizable within the target culture's social norms, making the Venusians' activities more relatable."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P058: Mais que sera-ce des Habitants de Mercure?

The English translation inserts the possessive pronoun \"our,\" changing it to \"our Negroes.\" In the context of late 17th-century England, which was deeply involved in the Atlantic slave trade and colonial enterprises, the addition of \"our\" domesticates the reference by framing it within the immediate colonial sphere and experience of the English target audience. This makes the (offensive) comparison more directly relatable to the target culture's contemporary social-economic context and prevailing racist ideologies, thereby aligning the text with target cultural values and assumptions.","The French \"Petites Maisons\" was a common term for asylums in France, likely alluding to a specific Parisian institution like the Hôpital des Petites-Maisons. The English translation replaces this with \"Bethlem,\" a direct reference to the Bethlem Royal Hospital in London, colloquially known as \"Bedlam,\" a widely known English asylum. This substitution of a source-culture specific institutional reference with a familiar target-culture equivalent makes the concept immediately recognizable and resonant for an English readership, a clear act of domestication.","In the French original, \"ils\" (they) in \"s'ils étoient icy\" (if they were here) refers to the inhabitants of Mercury, illustrating the extreme brightness they experience by imagining their perception of Earth. The English translation changes the subject of this hypothetical situation to \"the Inhabitants of Venus.\" This transformation adapts the comparison. Instead of a direct, stark contrast between Mercury and Earth, the translator introduces Venusians (inhabitants of a planet also hotter than Earth but less extreme than Mercury).

This conceptual shift might simplify the scientific idea or align it more closely with target culture notions where celestial bodies like the Sun could be perceived as having a more direct, almost providential or self-contained agency, potentially making the speculation more familiar or acceptable by transforming a complex ecological balance into a simpler cause-and-effect originating from a single powerful entity.","The French term 'Gens' (people, persons, folk), used by Fontenelle to refer to the potential inhabitants of other planets, is translated as 'Animal.'

The English 'Mixture' is a far more prosaic and general term, suggesting a simple combination rather than an artful structure. This domestication occurs by adapting a metaphor: the translator replaces Fontenelle's literary and poetic imagery with a plainer, more abstract term, potentially to align the text with a less ornate or more 'scientific' stylistic norm preferred in English philosophical or popular science writing of the period, thereby reducing the source text's specific literary charm to enhance accessibility or conform to perceived target culture expectations for the genre.","Fontenelle's 'ce Siècle' (this century), written in 1686, unambiguously refers to the 17th century. The English translation 'this Age' is a more general and temporally ambiguous term. For an English reader, particularly of a slightly later translation, 'this Age' could mean 'the present age/era' or 'the modern age' rather than specifically the 17th century. This is a domestication that transforms a precise historical marker specific to the source text's context into a vaguer term. This makes the text more accessible and less 'dated' to the target audience by reducing the need for historical contextualization, but at the cost of the original's temporal specificity.","The French 'On est bien embarrassé à le dire.' (One is quite at a loss/embarrassed to say it) employs the personal pronoun 'on' and conveys a conversational, almost intimate sense of intellectual struggle. The English translation 'is all the difficulty:' recasts this into an impersonal, objective statement. This domestication adapts the style to align with target culture norms, as English philosophical or scientific prose of the era often favored a more formal and less overtly personal tone than Fontenelle's characteristic conversational style. This makes the text conform more to English expectations of the genre but diminishes the source text's distinctive personal engagement and charm."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

The English translation expands and specifies this by listing \"Philosophers, Astronomers and Mathematicians.\" The addition of \"Mathematicians\" is particularly notable, potentially domesticating the text by aligning the categories of scholars with those prominent or perhaps more distinctly recognized in the English intellectual context of the late 17th century, influenced by figures like Newton and the rise of mathematical sciences. This makes the reference more concrete and tailored to the target culture's understanding of scholarly roles.","The French \"engager\" (in the context \"qu'ils puissent ... engager aux Princes quelque Astre,\" meaning scholars might pledge or pawn a star to Princes) is a vivid metaphor with financial or feudal connotations. The English translation replaces this specific concept with the more general and innocuous idea of Princes being allowed \"to take their part\" in a star. This domestication transforms the original's bold and potentially unfamiliar metaphor by substituting it with a commonplace expression, thereby reducing its foreignness and making the transaction more aligned with conventional English expressions.","The French \"des écumes\" (scum, foam) is a direct and somewhat blunt term to describe solar phenomena. The English translation softens this by adding the hedging phrase \"as it were\" before \"a Scum.\" This addition adapts the original's directness to potentially more genteel English literary and conversational norms of the period, making the imagery less stark and more aligned with target culture expectations of polite discourse, especially in a work intended for a broad, refined audience.","The French \"comme un million de Monts Etna\" (like a million Mount Etnas) is a strong hyperbole. The English translation introduces the phrase \"as it werewolf\" (which appears in the provided target text) before \"a Million of Mount Aetna's.\" Assuming \"as it werewolf\" is a typographical variant or error for the common hedging phrase \"as it were,\" its function would be to soften the intensity of the hyperbole, making the statement more tentative. This would align the expression with a potentially more understated English rhetorical style, domesticating the vividness of the French original by reducing its assertiveness."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P063: J'avoüe que je m'étois trompé, répondis-je, je ne songeois qu'à la situation où est le Soleil,&amp; non à l'effet de sa lumiere; mais vous qui me redressez si à propos, vous voulez bien que je vous dise que vous vous êtes trompée aussi; les Habitans du Soleil ne le verroient seulement pas.

La tête me dût-elle tourner, dit elle en riant, il est beau de savoir ce que c'est que les Tourbillons. Achevez de me rendre folle, je ne me ménage plus, je ne connois plus de retenuë sur la Philosophie; laissons parler le monde, &amp; donnons-nous aux Tourbillons. Je ne vous connaissois pas de pareils emportements, répris-je; c'est dommage qu'ils n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet. Ce qu'on appelle un Tourbillon, c'est un amas de matiere dont les parties sont détachées les unes des autres, &amp; se meuvent toutes en un même sens; permis à elles d'avoir pendant ce temps-là quelques petites mouvements particuliers, pourveu qu'elles suivent toûjours le mouvement general. Ainsi un <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">Tourbillon de vent</span></span>, c'est une infinité de petites parties d'air, qui tournent en rond toutes ensemble, &amp; enveloppent ce qu'elles rencontrent. Vous savez que les Planetes sont portées dans la matiere celeste, qui est d'une subtilité, &amp; d'une agitation prodigieuse. Tout ce grand amas de matiere celeste, qui est depuis le Soleil jusqu'aux Etoiles fixes, tourne en rond, &amp; emportant avec soy les Planetes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">les fait tourner toutes en un même sens autour du Soleil</span></span>, qui occupe le centre; mais en des temps plus ou moins longs, selon qu'elles en sont plus ou moins éloignées. Il n'y a pas jusqu'au Soleil qui ne tourne; mais il ne tourne que sur luy-même, parce qu'il est justement au milieu de toute cette matiere celeste; &amp; vous remarquerez en passant, que quand la Terre seroit dans la place où il est, elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle- même. </p><p>P065: Voilà quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">le Maître</span></span>; mais en même temps les Planetes se composent de petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de celuy du Soleil. Chacune d'elles en tournant autour du Soleil, ne laisse pas de tourner autour d'elle-même, &amp; fait tourner aussi autour d'elle en même sens une certaine quantité de cette matière céleste, qui est toûjours prête à suivre tous les mouvements qu'on luy veut donner, s'ils ne la détournent pas de son mouvement general. C'est là le Tourbillon particulier de la Planete &amp; elle le pousse aussi loin que la force de son mouvement se peut étendre. S'il faut qu'il tombe dans ce petit Tourbillon quelque Planete moindre que celle qui y domine, la voilà emportée par la grande &amp; forcée indispensablement à tourner autour d'elle, &amp; le tout ensemble, la grande Planete, la petite, &amp; le Tourbillon qui les renferme, n'en tourne pas moins autour du Soleil.

Nous pourrions aussi-tôt y gagner qu'y perdre, répondis-je, peut être irions- nous soumettre à notre domination Mercure &amp; Venus, qui sont de petites Planetes, &amp; qui ne nous pourroient résister. Mais nous n'avons rien à esperer ny à craindre; les Planetes se tiennent où elles sont, &amp; les nouvelles conquêtes leur sont défenduës, comme elles l'étoient autrefois aux Rois de la Chine. Vous savez bien que quand on met de l'huile avec de l'eau, l'huile surnage. Qu'on mette sur ces deux liqueurs un Corps extremement léger, l'huile le soûtiendra, &amp; il n'ira pas jusqu'à l'eau. Qu'on y mette un autre Corps plus pesant, &amp; qui soit justement d'une certaine pesanteur, il passera au travers de l'huile, qui sera trop foible pour l'arrêter, &amp; tombera jusqu'à ce qu'il rencontre l'eau, qui aura la force de le soûtenir. Ainsi dans cette liqueur composée de deux liqueurs qui ne se mêlent point, deux Corps inégalement pesants se mettent naturellement à deux places differentes, &amp; jamais l'un ne montera, ny l'autre ne descendra. Qu'on mette encore d'autres liqueurs qui se tiennent separées, &amp; qu'on y plonge d'autres corps, il arrivera la même chose. Représentez-vous que la Matiere Celeste qui remplit ce grand Tourbillon, à differentes couches qui s'enveloppent les unes les autres, &amp; dont les pesanteurs sont différentes, comme celles de l'huile &amp; de l'eau, &amp; des autres liqueurs. Les Planetes ont aussi differentes pesanteurs; chacune d'elles par consequent s'arrête dans la couche qui a précisément la force necessaire pour la soûtenir, &amp; qui luy fait équilibre, &amp; vous voyez bien qu'il n'est pas possible qu'elle en sorte jamais.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light. But, pray, Madam, allow me to tell you, that you who have corrected me so justly, may also be mistaken your self: The Inhabitants of the Sun wou'd not so much as see it self; for they wou'd be incapable to support the dazling of his Light, or unable to receive it, by being too near; and all things well consider'd, the Sun wou'd be a Country of blind Men only. So that, once for all, I conclude, the Sun cannot be inhabited; and if you please, Madam, we will continue our Journey to the other Worlds: We are now come to the Centre, which is the lowest Point in all Circular Figures; and therefore must return back again, and go upwards. In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited.</p> <p>P049: The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours.

In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or Guards: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate.

I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light.

The English translation 'Moons, or Guards' replaces the scientific term 'Satellites' with the more vernacular and picturesque English term 'Guards.' While the scientific term 'satellite' (from Latin 'satelles' - attendant, guard) was available in English, 'Guards' makes the concept less abstract and potentially more accessible to a general English readership by using common language that evokes an attendant role, thus reducing the 'foreignness' of a Latinate scientific term.","The French key concept 'les Tourbillons de Descartes' (Descartes' Vortices) is translated by first retaining the anglicized 'Tourbillions' and then adding 'or Whistlings' as a supposed English equivalent. 'Whistlings' is not an accurate physical translation of 'tourbillon' (vortex/whirlwind) but refers to a sound possibly associated with wind. This adaptation may be an attempt to make the complex scientific concept more familiar or less intimidating to a lay English audience by linking it to a common sensory experience, even if it oversimplifies or misrepresents the physical nature of a vortex.","The French 'Tourbillon de vent' (whirlwind) is first translated directly as '(A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a) Whirl-wind.' The translator then adds 'or a Hurricain.' While 'whirlwind' is an accurate equivalent, 'hurricane' refers to a specific, powerful type of storm well-known and impactful to English speakers (especially in a maritime nation with colonial interests in the late 17th century). Adding 'Hurricain' provides a more vivid, culturally resonant, and perhaps dramatic example for the target audience, thereby domesticating the reference by linking it to a phenomenon familiar and significant within their specific geographical and cultural experience.","The French original states that the celestial matter 'les fait tourner toutes en un même sens autour du Soleil' (makes them all turn in the same direction around the Sun). The English translation specifies this direction as 'carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun'. This direction is incorrect for actual planetary orbital motion (which is West to East, or prograde) but accurately describes the apparent diurnal motion of celestial bodies due to Earth's rotation. By inserting 'from East to West,' the translator may be attempting to align the description with the most commonly observed celestial phenomenon, simplifying the concept for a lay audience or making it seem more intuitive, even at the expense of scientific accuracy for orbital mechanics. This adapts the text to a familiar, albeit misleading in this context, frame of reference.","In the phrase 'le Soleil est comme le Maître' (the Sun is like the Master), 'Maître' directly translates to 'Master.' The English translation substitutes this with 'Governor' ('the Sun is, as it were, Governor'). In 17th-century England, 'Governor' carried specific socio-political connotations (e.g., colonial governors, heads of institutions). This choice reframes the Sun's authority in terms more aligned with English concepts of rule, management, or delegated authority, rather than the potentially more absolutist or direct ownership implied by 'Maître,' thus resonating more with the target culture's socio-political lexicon.","The French phrase 'au commencement du Monde' (at the beginning of the world) is a relatively general temporal expression. The English translation 'after the Creation of the Universe' is more explicitly theological, directly invoking the concept of divine creation as understood in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Given the strong Protestant religious context and ongoing theological debates in late 17th-century England, this phrasing domesticates the text by aligning it more closely with the prevailing religious terminology and worldview of the target culture, framing the scientific discourse within an explicitly creationist understanding familiar to English readers.","The French 'tout à fait à notre bienséance' describes the Moon's capture by Earth's vortex as being entirely suitable, fitting, or convenient for Earth. The English translation 'forc'd its Obedience' dramatically shifts the meaning. It introduces a strong element of coercion, power dynamics, and subjugation that is not explicit in the original French. This alteration makes the celestial interaction more hierarchical and perhaps more dramatically engaging, possibly reflecting a cultural lens that emphasizes power relations or a translator's choice to use stronger, more active language deemed appealing to the target audience.","The French describes Jupiter as 'une Planete aussi entreprenante' (a planet as enterprising/initiative-taking/encroaching). 'Entreprenante' is a nuanced term with potentially mixed connotations. The English translation simplifies this to 'some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter,' a purely negative attribute. This change narrows the original's meaning, presenting Jupiter's potential influence in a more straightforwardly threatening manner. This adaptation might be intended to make the Marquise's concern more immediately understandable or to heighten dramatic tension for the English reader by using a simpler, more direct emotional framing."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P067: Je conçois, dit la Marquise, que ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs.

The English translation's addition of 'Mortals' specifies humanity in terms of its mortality. In the 17th-century English context, with its strong religious undercurrents (e.g., Protestantism, Anglican Church focus on orthodoxy), emphasizing human mortality was a common cultural and theological trope. This addition subtly aligns the text with target culture norms by invoking a concept readily understood and carrying particular weight for the English audience, making the Marquise's reflection more resonant with a worldview where human frailty was a pronounced aspect of discourse, contrasting somewhat with Fontenelle's more secular popular science tone.","This translation domesticates the original by:\na) Rendering 'les Gens' (People/Folk) as 'every Man,' reflecting 17th-century English patriarchal linguistic norms where 'Man' served as a generic term for humanity. This aligns the text with target culture social and linguistic conventions, making it sound idiomatic but also imposing a male-centric perspective less explicit in the French.\nb) Translating 'qui fixât...dans les places qui leur sont naturellement convenables' (that would fix...in the places naturally suitable for them) as 'to confine...to the Station that is fit for him.' The term 'Station' in 17th-century England strongly connoted a fixed social rank within an ordained hierarchy, a concept significant in the English socio-political context (e.g., Tory-Anglican High Church views on social order). 'Confine' further emphasizes this rigidity. This adapts the Marquise's wish for order to resonate with specific English concepts of social hierarchy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P068: Vous auriez tort de les luy envier, repris-je, il n'en a point plus qu'il ne luy en faut.

This adaptation aligns the text with the English Enlightenment's emphasis on \"Nature\" as an ordered, rational system, a prominent theme in the target culture's intellectual and scientific discourse (e.g., Newton, Royal Society).

This lexical choice elevates the register, moving from Fontenelle's deliberately popularized language towards the more formal style characteristic of English scientific writing and natural philosophy in the late 17th century.

The English translation significantly adapts this by having her wish for these inhabitants to be 'Colonies of Iupiter,' that they 'receive their Laws and Manners from thence, and pay Homage and Respect to Iupiter,' and look upon Jupiter 'with Veneration.' This introduces complex socio-political concepts of colonialism, vassalage, and formal hierarchical relationships that are absent in the original French. This is an instance of domestication as it adapts the concept of an alien society to align with structures of governance, hierarchy, and colonial relationships that would be familiar and resonant to a late 17th/early 18th-century English audience, making the alien world more comprehensible through the lens of their own societal and burgeoning imperial experiences.","The French source specifies 'une Vieille' (an old woman) as the first person Tycho Brahe might encounter, signifying bad luck. The English translation renders this as 'if the first he met (as he went out of his House in the Morning) were old,' referring to the first person encountered being old, without specifying their gender as female. This alteration domesticates the text by transforming a specific and potentially charged folkloric figure (the 'old woman' as an ill omen, which had strong connections to witchcraft beliefs) into a more generalized 'old person.' This may have been done to reduce potential discomfort for the target readership by making the superstitious element less specific and potentially less reminiscent of sensitive cultural memories or stereotypes related to witchcraft accusations, which were particularly potent in England."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit- elle, après que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The English translation replaces it with 'the Philosophical Transactions', which was the journal of the Royal Society of London, also founded in 1665. This is a clear instance of domestication where a specific source culture academic reference is substituted with its well-known target culture equivalent, making the text more immediately recognizable and relatable for an English readership of the period.","The French phrase 'la Loy commune' (literally 'the common law' or 'common rule') is translated as 'the common Law of Nature'. In the English context of the late 17th century, 'common law' primarily referred to the English legal system. By choosing 'the common Law of Nature', the translator employs a concept that was highly significant and widely discussed in English philosophical and scientific circles (e.g., by figures like Locke and Newton). This adaptation frames Fontenelle's more general idea of a universal rule in terms specifically resonant and familiar within the target culture's intellectual framework, thereby domesticating the concept by aligning it with prevalent target culture philosophical norms and language."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P074: Si ce n'êtoit, dit la Marquise, qu'il n'est point trop agreable de savoir qu'on ne nous peut découvrir de dedans Jupiter qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche, je me représenterois <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"2\">avec plaisir</span></span> ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, comme les nôtres le sont vers luy, &amp; cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle les Planetes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">s'entre-considèrent</span></span> &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">demandent l'une de l'autre</span></span>, Quel monde est-ce là?

The English translation explicitly changes the agent of this action from the personified planets to 'the Inhabitants of both.' This transformation of a poetic and potentially 'foreign' literary device (planets asking questions) into a more literal statement is a form of domestication, reducing the source text's metaphorical nature to align with a possibly more direct or rationalist expectation within the target culture for popular science writing.","The French verb 's'entre-considèrent' (consider each other/observe each other) describes the planets' mutual observation in a relatively neutral manner. The English translation introduces the adverb 'gravely,' which adds a specific tone of seriousness or solemnity to their action that is not explicit in the original. This is a domesticating adaptation of mood, potentially aligning the text with English cultural expectations of the early Enlightenment, which might have favored a more sober or profound tone when contemplating significant cosmic or philosophical ideas.","The French source expresses the Marquise's anticipated feeling as 'avec plaisir' (with pleasure), a common and relatively understated expression of enjoyment. The English translation significantly intensifies this to 'an Infinite Pleasure.' This amplification is a domesticating strategy that adapts the emotional register, possibly to align better with target culture norms of the early Enlightenment. During this period, the contemplation of vast and novel scientific ideas like the plurality of worlds might be expected to evoke, or be expressed with, a more profound sense of awe, making the Marquise's reaction more impactful for the English audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P075: Cela ne va pas si vite que vous pensez, répliquay-je.

The English translation adds \"Fool enough,\" explicitly judging the person upfront as foolish for such an imagination, before mentioning the subsequent ridicule from the inhabitants of Jupiter. This addition intensifies the original idea and adapts the concept by framing the act of imagining extraterrestrial life with a more immediate and explicit condemnation, potentially aligning with a more direct or judgmental rhetorical norm or social attitude within the target (English) culture regarding such speculative ideas.","The French \"fait le procés à des Philosophes\" translates to \"put philosophers on trial\" or \"prosecuted philosophers.\" The English translation renders this as \"sued and persecuted.\" While \"sued\" covers the legal aspect of a trial, the addition of \"and persecuted\" significantly broadens the meaning to include wider forms of oppression beyond formal legal proceedings. In the late 17th-century English context, characterized by intense religious and political tensions (e.g., concerns about Catholic influence under James II, struggles between Whigs and Tories), the word \"persecuted\" would carry strong contemporary resonance. This domesticates the original by adapting the concept of facing opposition for one's ideas to align more closely with the target audience's socio-historical experiences and anxieties concerning persecution for beliefs.","The French source uses \"leurs Christophe Colombs\" (their Christopher Columbuses), a plural form indicating archetypal explorers or figures *like* Columbus. The English translation changes this to the singular, specific historical figure \"Christopher Columbus.\" This personalization, combined with the translator's contextual addition within the same descriptive clause, \"and understanding Navigation so well\" (a skill highly valued in maritime England, a rising colonial power), tailors the reference. It transforms a general French concept into a more concrete example featuring a renowned individual, embellished with a culturally significant skill, thereby making the example more relatable, admirable, and resonant with English target cultural values of the period.","Fontenelle's French \"Saturne avec les siennes\" (Saturn with its own [moons]) is non-specific regarding the number of Saturn's moons. The English translation specifies \"Saturn with the five that belong to him.\" By the time of Fontenelle's original publication (1686) and certainly by the time of early English translations (e.g., Aphra Behn's in 1688), five moons of Saturn had been discovered and were known in scientific circles. This specification updates the text to reflect current astronomical knowledge that would have been familiar to the scientifically-aware English readership. This is an act of domestication as it makes the text more scientifically \"accurate\" and authoritative according to the target culture's contemporary understanding, eliminating the original's slight vagueness by conforming to established scientific fact prevalent in England at the time."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P076: Quoy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">dit la Marquise</span></span>, vous comptez cela pour une grâce?

The English translation adds \"Lady\" before \"Marquiese,\" attempting to assimilate the French title into a more familiar English pattern of addressing female nobility (e.g., Lady Helen), thus domesticating the foreignness of the title for the target audience.","The French \"répondis-je\" (I replied) is a direct statement. The English translation renders this as \"said I, Madam,\" inserting \"Madam\" as a term of address. This addition adapts the dialogue to English social conventions of politeness and deference, particularly when addressing a high-status woman, aligning the interaction with target culture norms.","The French text uses \"Tourbillon,\" a specific scientific term from Cartesian physics (referring to a vortex), which might have been unfamiliar to a general English audience. The translator retains the term (anglicized as \"Tourbillion\") but immediately provides an explanatory gloss: \"or whirling of the Sun.\" This domesticates the potentially obscure foreign term by making it immediately accessible and understandable to the English reader using common descriptive language.","The French \"qui n'en sentons pas le prix\" translates to \"who do not feel/appreciate its value/worth,\" referring to Nature's \"faveur\" (favour) of showing only some planets. The English translation uses \"who are not sensible of this Grace.\" By translating \"prix\" (value/worth) in this context to \"Grace\"—a term with strong religious and moral connotations of divine beneficence in 17th-century England—the translator domesticates the original by subtly aligning the concept with target cultural sensitivities, shifting the nuance from appreciating mere \"value\" to recognizing a more profound \"Grace.\"","The French \"nous faisons si bien que nous attrapons les neuf autres\" (we do/manage so well that we catch/find the other nine) is relatively direct and uses the somewhat informal \"attrapons.\" The English translation \"have so ordered the matter that by our Endeavours we have found out the other nine\" is more periphrastic, formal, and emphasizes methodical human effort (\"ordered the matter,\" \"Endeavours\").

The English translation changes this to an expression of logical expectation: Mars 'ought to have a Moon too.' This adaptation subtly alters the Marquise's reasoning, presenting her as forming a hypothesis based on the preceding discussion (planets distant from the sun have moons), rather than simply noting an exception. This aligns her discourse more with an idealized form of deductive reasoning, potentially making it more familiar or appealing to the target Enlightenment-era audience.","The French scientific term 'des Phosphores' (phosphorescent substances) is replaced in the English translation with the vaguer phrase 'several bodies —,' followed by a description. This simplification avoids a potentially unfamiliar specialized term, making the text more accessible to a general readership and thus domesticating the scientific language.","The specific French term 'des Phosphores naturels' (natural phosphors), used to describe the rocks on Mars, is translated descriptively as 'naturally of such a kind of Substance'. This is another instance of avoiding the potentially unfamiliar scientific term 'phosphor' by paraphrasing its meaning, thereby reducing the foreignness of the vocabulary for the target audience.","The French phrase 'sans aucun art' (without any art/artifice), describing the natural illuminations, is rendered in English as 'without Art or Expence.' The addition of 'or Expence' introduces an economic consideration (cost-free nature) not explicitly present in the original. This addition may reflect a cultural value or pragmatic concern within the English target audience of the time, domesticating the description by framing it in terms familiar or relevant to their worldview.","The French text states that one can use the luminous birds 'pour lire' (to read). The English translation expands on this by adding a direct comparison to a familiar domestic item: 'that one may read by their Light, as well as by that of a Candle;'. This addition domesticates the unfamiliar concept by grounding it in the everyday experience of the 17th-century English reader, for whom a candle was a standard source of light for reading, thus making the phenomenon more concrete and relatable.","The French text states that Mars ('il') 'faut qu'il ait pour ses nuits des ressources' (must have resources for its nights). The English translation shifts the focus to the inhabitants: 'certainly, the Inhabitants of that Planet enjoy some other advantage'. This change makes the benefit of these unknown resources explicitly for the supposed living beings on Mars, rather than a feature of the planet itself. This adaptation makes the concept more directly relatable to the theme of extraterrestrial life and anthropocentric concerns, potentially aligning better with the target audience's interests."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oiseaux.

Good God, said she, suffer me to be grateful for every thing; even to the very Tourbillion where I was born: The measure of the Happiness bestow'd upon us, is too little to lose any part of it; and it is good to have such a Sense and Taste of the commonest and most considerable things, as to turn all to our Advantage and Profit. If we shou'd look after no other <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">Pleasure or Satisfaction, than this World afforded</span></span>, we shou'd enjoy but very few, expect 'em long, and pay dear for 'em. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">If Philosophy be the Pleasure, you propose, said I, Madam, I have the Boldness to wish, that when you remember the Tourbillions, you wou'd be pleas'd to think of me.</span></span> Yes, answer'd she, provided you take care your Philosophy furnishes me always with new Pleasures. At least, for to Morrow, answer'd I, I hope you shall not want; for I have the fixed Stars prepared for you, which surpass all you have hitherto heard.</p>","explanations":["The French phrase \"des plaisirs vifs\" (intense/lively pleasures), appearing in the Marquise's line \"Si on ne vouloit que des plaisirs vifs...\" (If one wanted only intense pleasures...), is effectively translated as \"Pleasure or Satisfaction, than this World afforded\" within the English construction \"If we shou'd look after no other Pleasure or Satisfaction, than this World afforded...\". This reinterprets the potentially ambiguous French concept of \"intense pleasures\" by explicitly framing them as \"worldly pleasures.\" This adaptation domesticates the original by aligning the concept with a moral or societal dichotomy (worldly vs. intellectual/philosophical pursuits) likely more familiar or emphasized in the late 17th-century English cultural context, thereby making the discussion of such pleasures less abstract and potentially preempting interpretations that might be considered improper by the target readership.","The philosopher's playful and somewhat flirtatious challenge in French asks the Marquise if, were she offered \"ces plaisirs vifs\" (these intense pleasures), she would still remember their intellectual discussions (\"des Tourbillons & de moy\") and, crucially, \"vous vous borneriez à nous?\" (would you limit/content yourself with us?). The English translation significantly alters this. It recasts the \"Pleasure\" as explicitly \"Philosophy\" and transforms the philosopher's query into a more decorous and sentimental wish: \"I have the Boldness to wish, that when you remember the Tourbillions, you wou'd be pleas'd to think of me.\" This omits the direct reference to \"plaisirs vifs\" in his challenge and entirely removes the suggestive question of her \"limiting herself\" to their company. This domestication tones down the Gallic wit and potential for amorous subtext, adapting the dialogue to conform to more reserved English social and moral norms of the period, especially for a work of popular science intended for a general audience including women."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">CINQUIEME SOIR.

The English translation, 'The Fifth Night.', omits this descriptive subtitle entirely. This elimination is an instance of domestication because it removes a characteristic element of Fontenelle's didactic and popularizing style, where such explicit subtitles guided the reader. This adaptation likely aimed to conform the text to English literary conventions for chapter titles of the period, which might have favored greater brevity or a less overtly didactic presentation. In doing so, the translation makes the heading structure less 'foreign' but erases a significant source culture nuance related to Fontenelle's method of popularizing complex scientific ideas."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P086:.

The English translation changes this specific mention to 'a hundred and fifty Millions of Miles.' This is an act of domestication as it alters the unit of measurement from the French 'lieue' to the English 'Mile,' and also changes the numerical value. This makes the distance more accessible to an English reader using familiar units and potentially adjusts the scale to contemporary English astronomical understanding or for rhetorical effect.","The French source uses the stark metaphor 'où les Etoiles êtoient cloüées' (where the Stars were nailed). The English translation renders this as 'wherein the Stars were placed, as it were so many golden Nails or Studs.' This adaptation domesticates the original metaphor by softening its directness ('placed, as it were') and embellishing it with more conventional poetic imagery ('golden Nails or Studs'), potentially aligning it with established English literary expressions for celestial bodies and making it seem less blunt to the target audience.","The French text describes human ambition with general phrases: 'si on a tant d'ardeur de s'agrandir, si on fait desseins sur desseins, si on se donne tant de peine' (if one has so much ardor to aggrandize oneself, if one makes plans upon plans, if one gives oneself so much trouble). The English translation expands this into a more specific and vivid list of vices: 'circumventing, betraying, flattering, and poorly lying.' This elaboration domesticates the original by adapting a general philosophical reflection into a more pointed social critique, possibly to resonate more directly with an English audience familiar with political intrigue and moral corruption in the late 17th-century socio-political context.","The Marquise in the French text anticipates being reproached for 'mon indolence' (my indolence/laziness). The English translation changes this to 'my Poverty.' This substitution domesticates the concept by shifting the anticipated reproach from a character trait (indolence) to a socio-economic condition (poverty). This change might reflect different social anxieties or moral frameworks in the target culture, making the Marquise's philosophical detachment and its consequences more resonant or provocative for English readers.","The French source uses the term 'Tourbillons' (vortices), a key concept from Cartesian physics. The English translation initially retains the French term as 'Tourbillions' but immediately adds an explanatory gloss: 'or Whirlings.' This addition is a domesticating strategy, as it provides an English equivalent or descriptive term, thereby clarifying the potentially unfamiliar French scientific concept for the target readership and making the text more accessible."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle, en riant; il se sauve de tout, &amp; il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal.

These two sorts of Men, The Lover and Philosopher always take more than is given 'em. You must acknowledge that when I see two Objects alike in every thing that I do see, I have Reason to believe them to be also alike in what I see not; for where is the hindrance or difficulty?

Now, Madam, you are too far engag'd to retire; and therefore you must generously yield.

This domestication replaces a descriptive French expression with a vivid, common English metaphor, making the text more idiomatic and accessible to the target audience by aligning it with English linguistic norms.","The direct French imperative 'Ecoutez' (Listen) is translated as 'I fear,'. This substitution softens the command into a polite interjection, a common feature in English discourse. This domestication adapts the French directness to align with perceived English cultural norms of polite conversation, especially in a refined setting with a Marquise.","The French 'Ces deux sortes de Gens-là' refers to 'un Amant' (Lover) and 'un Mathematicien' (Mathematician) from the preceding lines where the analogy is set up. The English translation renders this summary phrase as 'The Lover and Philosopher', substituting 'Philosopher' for 'Mathematician' (which was correctly translated as 'Mathematician' in the setup). This domestication adapts the specific term to 'Philosopher', a broader category that might have been more culturally resonant or conventional for an English audience of the time, possibly aligning the speaker (a philosopher) more directly with the analogy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est de deviner.

This domestication adapts the imagery to be more evocative or charming in English by using a familiar social concept, potentially making the scientific description more accessible in line with target culture's stylistic preferences for popularization.","The French phrase \"qu'il ne puisse y avoir\" (that there can/may be), part of \"Je ne doute pas même qu'il ne puisse y avoir\", uses the subjunctive mood to express possibility or hypothesis. The English translation, in \"and I do not doubt but there are\", uses the indicative \"there are\", presenting the existence of these Tourbillons with greater certainty. This modal shift domesticates the text by making the philosopher's speculations sound more assertive, possibly reflecting a target culture preference for more direct statements in scientific popularization or a perception of increased certainty about such ideas.","The French question \"Enfin, que voudriez-vous?\" (Finally, what would you want?/What more could you ask for?) does not explicitly include a title of address in this specific instance.

This adaptation makes the Marquise's speech conform to a potentially more direct Anglophone conversational norm and simplifies the original's understated rhetoric, potentially making it more immediately accessible but less nuanced for the target reader.","The French original uses a question mark after \"milliers\" (thousands), signifying a rhetorical question, surprise, or an emphatic observation by the Marquise, contributing to the lively and engaging tone of Fontenelle's dialogue. The English translation replaces this with a period, transforming the utterance into a simple declarative statement (\"thousands.\").

The translator's decision to introduce 'infinitely more' at this earlier point can be seen as a domestication strategy, adapting the concept of cosmic scale to align with what might have been a more pronounced or readily accepted discourse on the universe's infinite nature in England at the time, potentially influenced by contemporary English scientific figures and making the statement more immediately impactful for the target audience.","The French 'autant que' means 'as many as', indicating that the number of stars discovered in a single constellation with a telescope is equal to the number previously visible in the entire sky with the naked eye.

The English translation omits this remark entirely, with the sentence ending after \"Seeds of Worlds;\". This elimination domesticates the text by removing a stylistic feature of authorial intrusion and rhetorical playfulness. This streamlining makes the narrative less self-referential, potentially aligning it with a perceived English preference for a more direct style in popular science writing of the period.","The French \"Ciel,\" in this astronomical context, most neutrally translates to \"sky\" or \"heavens.\" The English translation uses \"Heaven.\" In the 17th-century English context, \"Heaven\" carried stronger and more immediate religious connotations than \"sky.\" Fontenelle's work aimed to popularize a naturalistic Copernican view of the universe. Using \"Heaven\" domesticates the text by framing the cosmos in terms more familiar to an English audience accustomed to theological discourse, subtly aligning the new scientific ideas with the target culture's religious sensibilities.","The French phrase \"des malheureux\" translates to \"unfortunate ones\" or \"wretched people.\" The English translation significantly alters and intensifies this to \"several People in the Universe, who are under the Tribulation of dismal, real Nights.\" The word \"Tribulation\" is a powerful term with strong Christian religious connotations, particularly familiar to a 17th-century English audience through biblical texts and religious discourse, signifying profound suffering or divinely ordained affliction. This choice domesticates the original by adapting Fontenelle's more general term into a concept deeply resonant within the target religious culture, thereby intensifying the emotional impact and framing the idea in terms familiar to the English reader.","The French text states, \"Ces petits Mondes sortent apparemment de la regle generale, par laquelle...\" (These little Worlds apparently deviate from the general rule, by which...). The English translation omits the crucial introductory clause (\"Ces petits Mondes sortent apparemment de la regle generale\") which frames the subsequent explanation as an exception and includes the nuanced \"apparemment\" (apparently). Instead, the English text begins directly with \"By which,\" which corresponds to the French \"par laquelle,\" and then proceeds to state the general rule. This omission domesticates the text by simplifying the original's more nuanced argumentation, making the scientific explanation more direct, less speculative, and potentially more authoritative-sounding for the target audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P096: Je ne vous demande pas, dit la Marquise, s'il y a des Lunes dans les Mondes de la Voie de Lait; je voy bien qu'elles n'y seroient de nul usage aux Planetes principales qui n'ont point de nuit, &amp; qui d'ailleurs marchent dans des espaces trop étroits pour s'embarrasser de cet attirail de Planetes subalternes.

In the late 17th and early 18th-century English context, \"fancy\" often denoted imagination, sometimes with connotations of whim or a less rigorous mode of thought, particularly when associated with women. By attributing the difficulty to the Marquise's \"Fancy,\" the translator adapts the concept to align with potential target culture perceptions of female intellect, framing her intellectual challenge in terms that might have been more conventional or expected for a woman in that society, possibly softening the 'veritable' (true, real) nature of the difficulty as presented in the source.","The French \"Je veux m'imaginer cela\" translates to \"I want to imagine that\" or \"I am trying to picture that.\" This emphasizes the process of mental visualization, a key element of Fontenelle's method for making complex scientific ideas accessible and particularly relevant to grasping the spatial problem of how vortices (spheres) can touch. The English translation changes this to \"This I wou'd willingly understand.\" This shift from the concrete act of \"imagining\" (m'imaginer) to the more general cognitive goal of \"understanding\" domesticates the text. It aligns the Marquise's described intellectual process with what might have been considered a more 'rational' or abstract form of comprehension in the target culture, potentially downplaying the active, visual role of imagination that Fontenelle highlighted as a valid path to scientific understanding, especially in a work aimed at a non-specialist and female audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P097: Il y a beaucoup d'esprit, répondis-je, à avoir cette difficulté-là, &amp; même à ne la pouvoir résoudre; car elle est tres-bonne en soy, &amp; de la maniere dont vous la concevez, elle est sans réponse, &amp; c'est avoir bien peu d'esprit que de trouver des réponses à ce qui n'en a point.

This makes Fontenelle's analogy more vivid and immediately understandable by linking it to a popular aspect of English culture.","The French phrase \"vous remplit ce vuide\" (part of \"Nature...vous remplit ce vuide\") includes a direct address (\"vous\" - you) to the interlocutor, making the explanation personal and engaging, characteristic of Fontenelle's conversational style. The English translation, within the phrase \"Nature...instantly fills up that Vacuity,\" omits this direct address, rendering the statement more impersonal and objective. This shift is a domestication strategy that aligns the tone with potentially more formal or less directly personal conventions of popular scientific exposition in English at the time."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

The English translation 'justling together' (bumping or pushing against each other, often chaotically in a crowd) domesticates this by softening the original metaphor. This adaptation makes the celestial interaction seem less like a deliberate 'battle' and more like a physical, possibly less organized, process. Such a rendering would align better with the emerging rationalist and scientific sensibilities of late 17th-century England, influenced by figures like Newton, where celestial mechanics were increasingly understood in terms of forces and physical laws rather than anthropomorphic conflicts. 'Justling' reframes the interaction in terms that are more akin to physical consequence and less dramatically 'war-like', thereby reducing a foreign element (the potentially overly dramatic metaphor for a scientifically inclined audience) to better suit target culture norms of scientific popularization which might favor more mechanistic descriptions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P099: Non, non, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">repris-je</span></span>, ce n'est pas le seul. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"1\">Les Mondes voisins nous envoyent quelquefois visiter</span></span>, &amp; même assez magnifiquement.

While Fontenelle's dialogue is inherently polite, the explicit insertion of 'Madam' where the French source text simply states 'repris-je' (I replied/I resumed) tailors the dialogue to specifically English conversational conventions and standards of formality of the era. This adaptation makes the interaction feel more native and immediately familiar to an English reader by aligning it with target culture social norms.","The French 'nous envoyent quelquefois visiter' (literally 'send to visit us sometimes') describes a general act of visitation. The English translation specifies 'send Envoys,' framing these interplanetary 'visits' in terms of formal diplomatic missions. 'Envoys' are official messengers or state representatives, a concept deeply embedded in the political and social framework of 17th-century England, a nation heavily involved in international diplomacy. This domestication adapts the abstract concept of extraterrestrial contact by aligning it with familiar target culture norms of official, structured interactions between polities, making it more concrete and relatable.","The French 'une queüe majestueuse' translates to 'a majestic tail,' a general descriptive phrase for the comet's appearance, evoking grandeur. The English translation uses 'a Royal Train.' In 17th-century England, a 'Royal Train' specifically referred to the train of a monarch's robe or their ceremonial retinue, potent symbols of royal authority and splendor. By replacing a general description of majesty with a culturally specific image tied to English royalty, the translator domesticates the metaphor. This aligns the celestial phenomenon with target culture norms and symbols, making the comet's grandeur resonate more powerfully and familiarly with an audience accustomed to monarchical displays."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P100: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">Ah!</span></span> quels Deputez dit-elle en riant!

The English translation uses \"Good God!\", a more culturally specific and emphatic interjection common in English. This substitution domesticates the Marquise's reaction by rendering it in a conventionally English manner, thereby reducing the foreign feel of the dialogue for a late 17th-century English audience.","The French text states that comets only scare \"enfants\" (children). The English translation expands this to \"Fools and Children.\" The addition of \"Fools\" creates a common English pairing, intensifying the statement by suggesting not just childlike naivety but also a lack of intelligence. This adaptation aligns the philosopher's remark with target culture rhetoric, potentially making it more familiar or impactful to English readers.","The French phrase \"mais les enfants sont en grand nombre\" (but children are in great number) is translated as \"but of those Ignorants, I confess, there are a great number:\". The replacement of \"enfants\" (children) with \"Ignorants\" broadens the criticism from childlike naivety to a more general state of ignorance. This change domesticates the original nuance, aligning the philosopher's observation more closely with Enlightenment ideals of combating widespread ignorance, and the addition of \"I confess\" adds a tonal shift common in English prose.","The English translation adds the polite term of address \"Madam\" in \"Madam, said I,\" which is not explicitly present in the French source's \"repliquay-je\" (I replied). While the philosopher in Fontenelle's complete work does address the Marquise as \"Madame,\" its specific insertion here ensures the dialogue conforms more explicitly to English conventions of politeness and social address between a gentleman scholar and a high-ranking lady. This subtly domesticates the interaction by reinforcing an English standard of expressed courtesy within the dialogue.","The French source \"ce Tourbillon êtant peut-être differemment pressé\" includes \"peut-être\" (perhaps), indicating a degree of hypothesis or uncertainty in the philosopher's explanation. The English translation renders this as \"this Tourbillion being press'd\", omitting the modal of uncertainty. This domestication makes the scientific explanation sound more assertive and less speculative, potentially aligning the text with a target culture expectation for more authoritative scientific pronouncements, particularly in the English context of Newton's rising influence.","The English translation renders the first part of the source sentence about comets being highly elevated above Saturn. However, it entirely omits the subsequent, substantial passage from the French original. This omitted section details a \"grand espace vide\" (large empty space), the criticisms from \"Nos Ennemis\" (Our Adversaries/Enemies) concerning this void, and Fontenelle's characteristically whimsical justification for it as an \"appartement des Planetes étrangeres\" (an apartment for foreign Planets). This significant elimination is a form of domestication, as it removes elements that might have been considered too speculative, too closely tied to Cartesian physics (which was being superseded by Newtonian ideas in England), stylistically too fanciful, or potentially controversial (the mention of \"Ennemis\") for the target English audience. The omission results in a more direct and less idiosyncratic conclusion to the philosopher's point, possibly to better suit perceived English literary or scientific tastes of the period."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P101: J'entends, dit-elle..

Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"3\">Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer</span></span> que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, il faut que l'espce se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"4\">des herbes ou des plantes</span></span> par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, répliquai-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au-delà, il faudroit être plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent être ou n'être pas si on veut, ou être tels que l'on veut, il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P074: I understand you, said she, and am pleas'd with your Chamber of State; for we do not permit 'em to come directly in the middle of our Tourbillion, but receive 'em as the Grand Seignior does his Foreign Ministers; he does 'em not the Honour to lodge 'em in Constantinople, but sends 'em to the Suburbs. Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or false Light. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light? The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, and then farewell the Sun and all its Light. 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect. The Ancients were foolish to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience; but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener, but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is: Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever, yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? Eternity is not so easy a matter; and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish. Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them. If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other. Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie.

This substitution aligns the concept with the popular English notion of \"Change of Air\" as a remedy or means to improve well-being, a common understanding in 17th/18th century England. This adapts the original idea to a familiar target culture value and idiom, making it more accessible and relatable.","The French \"dans le Ciel\" (in the Sky/Heaven) is rendered as \"in the Firmament.\" In late 17th-century England, \"Firmament\" was a term heavily associated with the King James Bible's account of creation. Using this word, instead of a more neutral \"sky\" or \"heavens,\" domesticates the text by linking Fontenelle's scientific discourse to a powerful and familiar religio-cultural touchstone for the English Protestant readership. This could make the new astronomical ideas seem less alien or more authoritative by couching them in a traditional, scriptural vocabulary, thereby reducing potential friction with religious sensibilities of the era.","Fontenelle's simple French \"tournent sur eux-mêmes\" (turn on themselves), aimed at a general audience, is translated with the more technical scientific term \"turn upon their own Axis.\" This choice reflects a domestication strategy by adapting the language to the increasingly precise and formal terminology of \"Natural Philosophy\" prevalent in England, a leading center of the Scientific Revolution (Newton's Principia was published in 1687, a year after Fontenelle's work). It elevates the register to align with target culture expectations for scientific discussion, even in a popular work, making it appear more 'learned' to an English audience.","The French \"plaisants\" (which can mean amusing, odd, or ridiculous in a lighter, more ironic sense) is translated as the more direct and condemnatory \"foolish.\" This tonal shift makes the critique of the Ancients harsher and less nuanced. Such a direct, judgmental tone could be seen as an adaptation to a more assertive English prose style of the early Enlightenment period, domesticating Fontenelle's subtle irony into a blunter statement that might have resonated more with certain segments of the English readership eager to dismiss older authorities decisively.","The original French \"des herbes ou des plantes\" (herbs or plants) is expanded in the English translation to the tripartite \"Herbs, Plants and Flowers.\" The addition of \"Flowers\" creates a more conventional and rhythmically familiar phrase common in English literary and descriptive traditions. This is a stylistic domestication, subtly altering the phrasing to align with common English collocations and aesthetic preferences, making the text sound more naturally 'English' and perhaps more conventionally poetic or complete to the target audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers!

The English translation transforms this into 'the Heavens, Sun, Moon or Stars'. This domestication involves two key changes: \n1. 'Le Ciel' (the Sky) is translated as 'the Heavens'. In the astronomical context alongside 'Sun' and 'Stars', 'sky' is a more direct equivalent of 'Ciel'. The choice of 'the Heavens' introduces a more elevated, poetic, and potentially religiously tinged connotation common in English discourse about the cosmos. This could make the text more resonant or acceptable to a late 17th-century English audience, where religious sensitivities regarding new scientific ideas about the universe were significant.\n2. The 'Moon' is added to the list. The Moon is a central topic in Fontenelle's discussions of plural worlds but is absent from this specific enumeration in the original French. Its inclusion in the translation makes the list of celestial bodies more conventionally complete from an English perspective, adapting the source text to better align with the target reader's likely expectations of such a list in astronomical or poetic contexts."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">FIN</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P076: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P076: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text NCE\" data-index=\"0\">FINIS.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French source uses \"FIN\", the standard French term for \"END\" to mark the conclusion of the book. The English translation replaces this with \"FINIS.\", a Latin term that was conventionally used at the end of English-language books during the 17th and 18th centuries. This substitution domesticates the text by conforming to the typographical and publishing norms prevalent in the target (English) literary culture of the period, making the book's presentation more familiar and conventional to an English reader."]}],"counts":{"manual":7,"ai":204}}
