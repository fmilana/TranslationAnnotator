Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement.</span></span> La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile</span></span>, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">eussay-je resvé assez longtemps</span></span>; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante.</span></span> Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce</span></span> que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet.</span></span> Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">de ce qui touche</span></span>, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais?

C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux</span></span>; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface.

I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self.

The phrase \"il n'y a pas moyen de vous l'épargner\" (there's no way to spare you it) is softened to \"I cannot well avoid it.\" Additionally, the somewhat abstract \"la chose m'y porte necessairement\" (the thing/matter carries me to it necessarily) is rendered as the more direct and common \"the Subject leads me naturally to it,\" simplifying vocabulary and structure.","The French subordinate clause uses verbs in the imperfect subjunctive (\"dérobast,\" \"obscurcist\"). The English translation simplifies this grammatical complexity by using infinitive verb forms (\"to rob,\" \"to obscure\") following \"appear'd,\" a common English construction that is structurally simpler.","The French \"eussay-je resvé assez longtemps\" uses a formal inverted conditional past subjunctive construction (\"I would have dreamed long enough\"). The English \"I had long continued so\" simplifies this to a more direct past perfect conditional structure, which is less complex syntactically.","The French \"ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune & aux Etoiles\" (did not permit me to abandon myself to the Moon and Stars) conveys surrendering to reverie. The English \"withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars\" simplifies this by focusing on a more concrete action (withdrawing admiration) rather than the more abstract and immersive \"abandonner\" (to abandon/surrender oneself), reducing psychological nuance.","The French \"plus touchante\" (more touching/moving) conveys a specific emotional impact. The English \"that has more of charm\" uses a more general term (\"charm\") and a common phrasing (\"has more of...\"), simplifying the specific emotional nuance of \"touchante\" through lexical choice.","The French \"ne vous eust jamais jetté\" (would never have thrown you), using the vivid verb \"jeter\" (to throw) and the imperfect subjunctive, is simplified. The English \"never put you into\" uses the more general verb \"put\" and a simple past tense, reducing both the imagery's intensity and grammatical complexity.","The French sentence uses a subordinate clause \"que le jour... fist aussi le mesme effet\" with the verb \"fist\" in the imperfect subjunctive. The English translation simplifies this structure by using an infinitive phrase \"to have the same effect\" governed by \"I would have the day,\" a less complex grammatical construction.","\"ce qui touche\" (that which touches/moves) is replaced by \"what is charming.\" \"Charming\" is a more general and less emotionally specific term than \"touche,\" simplifying the nuance of the original through lexical choice.","The French \"ne s'attire point leurs confidences\" (literally \"does not attract their confidences at all\") uses the active reflexive verb \"s'attirer\" (to attract to oneself). The English \"shares not at all in their Confidence\" uses a more static construction with \"shares in,\" simplifying the dynamic action implied by \"s'attirer.\"","The French \"que le Ciel presente\" (that the Sky/Heaven presents) is a relative clause. The English \"of Heaven\" simplifies this to a prepositional phrase. Additionally, \"plus doux\" (softer, gentler) conveys a specific sensory quality, while \"more pleasing\" is a more general term, simplifying the original description.","The French phrase \"où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir\" (into which one does not fall without pleasure) uses an indirect litotes (double negative) to convey pleasure. The English \"creates a certain pleasing disorder\" simplifies this by directly stating the disorder is \"pleasing\" and using an active verb, making the sentence structure more straightforward.","The French \"je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer\" (I am very sorry/annoyed that it is necessary to admit it to you) combines an emotional state (\"bien fâché\") with an impersonal obligation (\"il faille\"). The English \"I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you\" streamlines this by focusing on the obligation through a more direct, albeit formal, reflexive construction, simplifying the original's dual expression of emotion and necessity.","The French \"Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray\" uses a conditional (\"jurerois\") with an imperfect subjunctive (\"fust vray\"). The English \"I will not swear 'tis true\" simplifies this to a future tense indicative. Furthermore, \"je le tiens pour vray\" (I hold it for true) is a strong assertion of conviction, simplified to the more common and less forceful \"but that is my opinion.\"","The French \"il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire\" is a complex construction (lit. \"there are not even Truths to which pleasantness is not necessary\"). The English \"delight is not amiss even in Truth it self\" drastically simplifies this into a more direct statement using the less convoluted idiom \"is not amiss,\" reducing structural complexity.","The French includes the adverbial phrase \"bien viste\" (very quickly), modifying \"répondis-je\" (I replied). The English translation \"said I\" omits this modifier, simplifying the description by removing the detail about the quickness of the speech.","The French presents two distinct clauses: an assertion \"Je veux...voir le contraire\" and a command \"apprenez-moy...\". The English combines these into a single sentence linking them via \"and\" (\"do this, and then this will happen\"), simplifying the discourse structure by making the logical connection more explicit within one syntactic unit.","The French \"j'aye parlé de Philosophie\" uses the perfect subjunctive (\"aye parlé\") in the subordinate clause. The English translation simplifies this by using the simple past tense \"I entertain'd,\" a less complex verb form for this context."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder.

Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyait bien, ce serait toujours autant de connu, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est.</span></span> Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voient point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Sur cela je me figure toujours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle</span></span> qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opéra. Du lieu où vous êtes à l'Opéra, vous ne voyez pas le Théâtre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à votre veue ces roues &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvements. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner comment tout cela joue. Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire,</span></span> &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien qu'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers; car représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles.</span></span> Suposons qu'ils voyaient le Vol de Phaéton que les Vents enlèvent, qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton. L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide; &amp; cent autres rêveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenue bien mécanique? Si mécanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bientôt honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvements régléz qui dépendent de l'arrangement des parties. Avouez la vérité.

When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World.

All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected.

This reduction in the density of information makes the overall statement more streamlined and easier for the reader to process.","The French \"J'en revenois toujours à luy dire\" implies a recurring thought or repeated statement. The English \"So that I e'n told her again\" simplifies this by presenting it as a more direct, sequential action (\"So that... I told her\"), which simplifies the narrative progression by removing the nuance of habitual return to the idea.","The French \"voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay\" (here is the reasoning into which I threw myself) uses a more vivid and figurative expression. The English \"I began with her thus\" is a much more direct, neutral, and common phrasing, simplifying the original's stylistic flourish and reducing its figurative intensity.","The French \"vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir\" (you would not care to know it) is a standard negated reflexive verb. The English \"you would not care two pence to know\" introduces a colloquial idiom (\"care two pence\"). This simplifies the register, making it more informal and using more common, everyday language for emphasis, thus potentially enhancing accessibility.","The original French \"mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est\" (but one sees it completely differently than it is) is a straightforward statement. The translation \"but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are\" adds the idiomatic phrase \"the mischief is.\" This addition frames the statement in a more colloquial and less formal manner, simplifying the tone by making the negative implication more explicit and accessible.","The French \"un grand Spectacle\" (a grand spectacle/show) is translated to \"a great shew\" (an archaic spelling of show). In the context of early modern English, \"shew\" was a common term for a display, and rendering \"grand Spectacle\" as \"great shew\" might slightly reduce the formality or grandeur implied by \"Spectacle,\" opting for a more generally understood term.","The French \"s'inquiète d'un Vol\" (worries about/is concerned by a Flight [a specific stage effect]) is rendered as \"who would beat his brains about a Turn.\" The idiom \"beat his brains\" is more colloquial and vivid, simplifying the formal \"s'inquiète.\" Additionally, \"Vol\" (flight) is translated to the more general \"Turn\" (an act or effect), simplifying the specific technical reference to a broader, more common term.","The French phrase \"tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles\" (all these People whose name today makes so much noise in our ears) is a descriptive clause. The English translation \"all that learned crew\" simplifies this by using a more concise and informal collective noun (\"crew\") instead of the periphrastic description, reducing sentence complexity and formality.","The abstract French noun \"une obscurité\" (an obscurity) is translated into the concrete metaphor \"Clouds.\" This shift from an abstract concept to a concrete image simplifies the idea by making it more tangible and easier for the reader to visualize, thus enhancing readability and accessibility."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

The English 'Heaven which wheels them along with it' uses a more vivid and specific verb ('wheels them along') that directly evokes the circular motion of the heavens. This specification makes the description more immediate and easier to visualize, simplifying the somewhat general French phrasing.","The French 'produisit' (produced) is rendered as 'gave them'. 'Gave them' is simpler and uses more common, concrete vocabulary than 'produced' in the context of 'observations,' making the sentence slightly more accessible as 'produced observations' is a more abstract phrasing.","The French 'pour reconnaître son champ d'avec celuy de son voisin.' (to distinguish/identify his field from that of his neighbor) is translated into the more concrete and action-oriented phrase 'to lay out his own Field from his Neighbours.' The verb 'lay out' simplifies the more abstract cognitive process implied by 'reconnaître...d'avec' by focusing on the practical action of defining boundaries, making the purpose more immediately graspable.","The vivid French metaphor 'est fille de l'Oisiveté' (is the daughter of Idleness) is replaced by the more abstract and analytical phrase 'derives it self from Idleness.' This substitution simplifies by removing the figurative language, reducing stylistic richness for a more denotative expression, which can be seen as a form of simplification aimed at accessibility over literary flourish.","The French metaphor 'est fille de l'Interêt' (is the daughter of Interest) is effectively replaced. The English uses the prepositional phrase 'from Interest,' implying the verb 'derives itself' from the preceding clause concerning Astronomy. This change simplifies by removing figurative language in favor of a more direct statement of origin, reducing stylistic richness.","The French 'nous trouverions apparemment' (we would apparently/seemingly find) includes a nuance of reservation or appearance ('apparemment'). The English 'we shall find' is more direct and assertive, omitting this qualifier, which simplifies the statement by removing a subtle shade of meaning.","The French metaphor 'qu'elle est fille de l'Amour.' (that she [Poetry] is the daughter of Love) is translated as 'it draws its Original from Love.' This again replaces the direct, personifying metaphor with a more formal and less figurative expression of origin ('draws its Original from'), simplifying the poetic imagery of the original and reducing stylistic richness."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie.

Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême.</span></span> Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer.</span></span> Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible.</span></span> Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries.</span></span> L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes.</span></span> Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal.</span></span> Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter.</span></span> Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">&amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide.</span></span> Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avi</span></span>s, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres.</span></span> Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là.</span></span> Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit</span></span>, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité.</span></span> Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner</span></span>, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës.

Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study.

Additionally, the metaphor \"dans la foule des Planetes\" (in the crowd of planets) is rendered as \"in the common road of the other Planets,\" making the concept more explicit and arguably easier to visualize.","The interjection \"Mon Dieu\" (My God) is omitted in the English translation. This simplifies the original exclamation, reducing its emphatic or religious tone and making the utterance more direct.","The nuanced phrase \"peut-être sans s'en apercevoir\" (perhaps without realizing it) is omitted from the translation. This simplifies the sentence by removing the suggestion of the philosopher's potential unconscious bias, making his supposition appear more straightforward or intentional.","The initial adverb \"Franchement\" (Frankly/Honestly) is replaced by the simpler and more general interjection \"Oh!\", simplifying the character's expressed manner of speaking.","The adjective \"humiliant\" (humiliating) is translated as \"humble.\" \"Humble\" is a more common word and significantly softens the meaning; \"humiliant\" implies an active causing of humiliation, whereas \"humble\" describes a quality of modesty, thus simplifying the original's sharper implication.","The French construction \"Il fut tres-long-temps à ne la vouloir pas publier\" (He was a very long time not wanting to publish it) involves a slightly complex phrasing. The English translation \"and was long before he would publish it\" simplifies the sentence structure, making it more direct.","The phrase \"à la priere de Gens tres-considerables\" (at the request/entreaty of very important/considerable people) is simplified to \"he was persuaded.\" This omits the specific detail about who initiated the persuasion, thereby reducing the informational density of the sentence.","The French \"car enfin on ne change point de place\" (for after all/in short, one does not change place at all) uses an impersonal pronoun and the nuanced \"enfin.\" The English \"for I cannot see that we change place\" simplifies this by using a personal perspective (\"I cannot see\") and omitting \"enfin,\" making the statement more direct and less abstract.","The French phrase \"à vostre air\" (by your air/look/demeanor), which describes an observation of general demeanor, is translated as \"in your face.\" \"Face\" is a more concrete and common term, simplifying the expression by making the observation more physically direct.","The French causative construction \"cela me feroit bien voir que\" (that would clearly make me see that / would clearly show me that) is simplified to the more indirect inferential statement \"from thence I should find that.\" This avoids the explicit causative structure.","The French idiomatic expression \"il n'en va pas de mesme de\" (it is not the same with / the same does not apply to) is simplified to the more common and structurally simpler English phrase \"'tis not so with.\"","The active and vivid French phrase \"S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles\" (If it [the Sun] did not erase/blot out the Stars) is simplified to the more passive and less imagistic \"if the Stars were then to be seen.\" Furthermore, the metaphorical \"en poussant ma veüe\" (in pushing my sight) is rendered as the more common \"in looking on,\" simplifying the imagery.","The French question \"Voulez-vous que je fasse...?\" (Do you want that I make/draw...?), which uses a subjunctive construction, is simplified to the English conditional offer \"if you please, Ile draw...\", which is structurally less complex and more direct.","The clause \"que je ne veux pas qu'il ait\" (that I do not want it to have) is simplified to the more idiomatic and concise English expression \"which I have no mind to [it having].\" This reduces the length and makes the phrasing more colloquial.","The French \"N'ai-je pas oüy dire que\" (Have I not heard it said that) is simplified to \"Have not I heard of\". The descriptive clause \"qu'il ne connaissoit point\" (that he did not know at all) referring to the island is condensed to the simpler adjectival phrase \"an unknown Island.\" Additionally, the phrase \"s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient\" (cried out to those who followed him) is simplified by omitting \"à ceux qui le suivoient,\" reducing textual density by removing the explicit mention of his companions at that moment.","The French verb \"Vous jugez bien que\" (You judge well that / You can well imagine that) is simplified to \"You know well,\" using a more common and direct verb of cognition."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs.

The English translation \"seems not easily manageable\" simplifies this by using the more direct and less subtly shaded phrase \"not easily.\" This makes the statement about the Earth's properties more straightforward.","The French sentence structure \"que ce fût [description], [subject]\" (that it were [description], [subject]) is a more complex, inverted presentational form. The English translation simplifies this by reorganizing it into a more standard and direct subordinate clause structure: \"that [subject] would be [description]\", which enhances readability by using a more common syntactic pattern.","The French reflexive participial phrase \"se laissant diviser avec facilité\" (literally \"letting itself be divided with ease\" or \"being easily divisible by its nature\") describes an inherent property with a degree of agency. The English translation simplifies this to a more direct and common passive voice construction \"is easily divided,\" reducing syntactic complexity.","The French \"elle résiste peu\" (it offers little resistance) indicates a small amount of resistance. The English \"makes no resistance\" simplifies this by removing the concept of degree and presenting an absolute state (no resistance at all). This reduction of nuance simplifies the idea, potentially for stronger rhetorical effect or easier comprehension, at the cost of fidelity to the original measure.","The French phrase includes a second purpose expressed by the infinitive \"& ne pas s'y laisser emporter?\" (and not allow itself to be carried away by it?), which elaborates on the idea of resisting. The English translation omits this second descriptive part of the clause, thereby reducing the length and density of the sentence by removing this elaboration, making the statement more concise."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P011: Mais, répliqua-t-elle encore, comment la Terre avec tout son poids se soûtient- elle sur votre matiere celeste qui doit être bien legere, puisqu'elle est si fluide? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Ce n'est pas à dire, répondis-je, que ce qui est fluide, soit plus leger.</span></span> Que dites-vous de notre gros Vaisseau, qui avec tout son poids est plus léger que l'eau, puisqu'il y surnage?

'Tis, says I, because they are so fair that their Husbands find in their favours a superfluity, which they allow to strangers. Then the Women of this Country, says the Marchioness, are very ugly, compared with them, for the Husbands here give no liberty at all. That's the reason, says I, they take more, whereas-Hold your peace, says she, I'le talk no more follies; besides I have a serious difficulty come in my head, If the Earth turn, we change Air every moment, and breath that of another Contry. Not at all, Madam, says I, the Air which surrounds the Earth extends but to a certain height, it may be twenty leagues or so, and it follows and turns along with us. You have a thousand times seen the Work of a Silkworm, or those Cods of Silk which those little Animals work with so much Art for their own Prison, they are of a close wrought Silk, but are covered with a certain Down very light and loose. Just so the Earth. which is solid enough, is cover'd from the surface about twenty leagues high at most, with a kind of Down, which is the Air; This and all the other Cod of the Silkworm turns at the same time. Beyond the Air is the Celestial matter incomparably more pure, more subtil, and likewise more in motion than it. You give me, said the Marchioness, Idea's of the Earth contemptible enough; is it then upon this shell of a Silkworm that we labour and toil, and fight, and make such a noise on all hands as we do? 'Tis even so, said I, and in the mean time Nature that takes no notice of those little tle particular motions, carrys us altogether with one general movement, and sports her self with the lit-Ball. To me, says she, it seems something ridiculous to be seated upon a thing that turns? and torment ones self so much; but the mischief is, we are not fully assur'd that we turn; for to tell you truth, notwithstanding all those precautions you have us'd, that a man should not perceive the motion of the Earth, I am still very doubtful. Is it possible it should not be discover'd by some little mark or other? The most natural motions, said I, and the most ordinary, are those which are least perceiv'd, and this is true even in Morality it self.

The impersonal \"on prend\" (one takes) is also simplified to the more concrete \"they take\", making the overall phrase more accessible.","The French \"il me vient une difficulté\" (a difficulty comes to me) is rendered with the more colloquial English idiom \"I have a difficulty come in my head.\" This simplifies the impersonal \"il me vient\" structure to a possessive construction, which is more common in conversational English.","The French \"peut-être jusqu'à\" (perhaps up to) is simplified through the addition of the colloquial qualifier \"or so\". This makes the expression of approximation more conversational and uses common English phrasing, slightly reducing formality.","The French reflexive verb construction \"pour s'y emprisonner\" (to imprison themselves therein) is simplified to a prepositional phrase with a noun \"for their own Prison.\" This shift from a verbal to a nominal construction makes the phrasing more direct and structurally less complex.","The French \"Vous me présentez la Terre sous des idées bien méprisables\" (You present the Earth to me under very contemptible ideas) is simplified. \"présentez... sous des idées\" becomes the more direct \"give me... Idea's\" using a more common verb. The intensifier \"bien\" (very) is rendered as \"enough,\" which can be a less forceful and simpler modification.","The French impersonal constructions \"il se fait de si grands Travaux, de si grandes Guerres\" (such great Works/Wars are made/done) and \"il règne... une si grande agitation\" (there reigns... such great agitation) are simplified. The translation shifts to active voice with the personal pronoun \"we\" (\"we labour and toil, and fight\"). Furthermore, the abstract noun \"une si grande agitation\" is replaced by the more concrete and colloquial phrase \"make such a noise on all hands,\" simplifying vocabulary and imagery.","The complex French idiom \"n'entre point en connaissance de\" (literally \"does not at all enter into knowledge of,\" meaning doesn't become aware of/doesn't consider) is simplified to the much more common and direct English idiom \"takes no notice of.\"","The French statement \"me sont suspectes\" (are suspect to me), which directly qualifies the precautions, is simplified. The translation shifts the focus to the speaker's internal state with \"I am still very doubtful.\" This expresses a similar sentiment of distrust using a more common adjective (\"doubtful\") and a simpler subjective predication compared to the object-focused \"sont suspectes\".","The French construction involving a future indicative \"ne laissera pas\" (will not leave) and a subjunctive in the relative clause \"à laquelle on le reconnaisse\" (by which one might recognize it) is simplified.

The English translation \"to carry on the business of Systems\" simplifies this by using more common vocabulary and a more pragmatic, less academic turn of phrase, suggesting continuation rather than exhaustive exploration.","The French uses an impersonal passive construction \"il fut résolu que...\" (it was resolved that...) followed by a reflexive pronominal verb \"nous nous en tiendrions à\" (we would stick to/abide by it). The English translation simplifies this complex structure to a more direct active voice construction \"we resolv'd to hold to...\", making the sentence easier to process.","The French phrase \"la simplicité dont il est\" (literally, \"the simplicity of which it is\" or \"the simplicity that it possesses\") uses a relative pronoun construction common in formal French to denote a characteristic. The English translation \"the Simplicity of it\" simplifies this by using a more direct and common prepositional phrase.","The original French presents the Marquise's entire reasoning and the subsequent resolution as one very long, complex sentence, structured with multiple subordinate clauses (\"qu'il y avoit...\", \"que le Soleil...\", \"que ce systême...\") dependent on \"jugea que\". The English translation breaks this single complex sentence into several shorter sentences (e.g., new sentences starting with \"That it was not so proper...\" and \"That that System...\"). This division significantly simplifies the syntactic structure, making the Marquise's arguments easier to follow by presenting them as a sequence of distinct points rather than a single, elaborate deduction.","The French adjective \"riant\" (literally \"laughing\" or \"smiling\") when applied to a system, carries a specific, somewhat poetic nuance meaning attractive, pleasing, or cheerful. The English translation \"more delightful\" uses a more common and general positive adjective.

The English translation uses the simple past \"never stirr'd,\" simplifying this nuanced temporal aspect into a more direct statement of past fact, thereby using a more common and less grammatically complex structure for such a description in English.","The French impersonal pronoun \"on\" (one/people) in \"on n'en a jamais entendu parler\" (one has never heard speak of them) is omitted in the English translation. The verb \"heard\" is instead directly linked to the burgess as the implied subject from the preceding clause (\"I... nor ever heard\"). This simplifies the sentence structure by maintaining a consistent first-person subject and avoiding a shift to an impersonal construction, making the statement more direct.","The French periphrastic phrase \"pour ce qui est d'être habité\" (literally, \"for that which is of being inhabited\" or \"as for being inhabited\") is simplified to the more concise English prepositional phrase \"in being inhabited.\" Additionally, the modal construction \"pourrait bien encore ressembler\" (could well still/also resemble) is condensed to \"possibly may likewise resemble,\" streamlining the phrasing and reducing its density.","The French construction \"il s'obstinera toûjours à soûtenir que\" (he will always/still persist in maintaining that) involves a reflexive verb followed by a preposition and an infinitive. This is simplified in the English translation to \"he's still obstinate that,\" which uses a more direct adjectival phrase with a copula (and includes the contraction \"he's\").

This simplifies the original by omitting the mention of \"vitesse\" (speed) and by condensing the lengthy descriptive clause about the ball's impact and rebound into the more concise phrase \"when reverberated from a Wall,\" streamlining the sentence and reducing descriptive detail.","The French \"c'est qu'elle est entre le Soleil & nous\" (it is that she is between the Sun and us) is rendered as \"she is then between the Sun and us.\" The English version simplifies the French \"c'est que\" construction, which is often used for emphasis or explanation, by transforming it into a more direct declarative statement, thus streamlining the sentence for an English reader.","The French idiomatic expression \"Nous n'avons garde de voir cette moitié\" (meaning \"We are far from seeing\" or \"We certainly do not see that half\") is translated as \"We do not look to see that half\". This simplifies the original by replacing a specific French idiom with a more straightforward English verb phrase using common vocabulary, potentially making it more accessible, though some of the idiom's nuance (implying impossibility or lack of opportunity rather than lack of trying) might be altered.","The French phrase \"& nous sommes en Décours pour elles\" (meaning \"and we are in a waning phase for them,\" applying the lunar term 'décours' to Earth as seen from the Moon) is translated as \"and we are running from them.\" This simplifies the original by replacing a specific astronomical term used metaphorically (\"en Décours\" - waning) with a more common, dynamic, and arguably more easily visualized action (\"running from them\").

The English translation \"prohibiting, That none should ever speak of an Eclipse\" simplifies this by using a present participle (\"prohibiting\") followed by a \"That\"-clause, resulting in a more direct and less grammatically intricate construction.","The French \"de peur que l'on ne conserve\" (for fear that one might preserve), a subordinate clause introduced by a conjunction (\"de peur que\") requiring the subjunctive mood, is simplified to the English prepositional phrase \"for fear of preserving.\" This change from a clausal structure to a more compact phrasal structure using a gerund reduces syntactic complexity.","The French phrase \"sur ce Chapitre là,\" literally \"on that chapter there,\" is an idiomatic expression meaning \"on that subject\" or \"concerning that matter,\" carrying a somewhat formal or literary connotation from its metaphorical origin.

[subjunctive verb 1]... & [subjunctive verb 2]...\" (It would be necessary that... [Arrêt abolît]... & [défendît qu'on parlât]...) requires multiple verbs in the subjunctive mood governed by the initial modal expression. The English translation \"necessary... to [infinitive verb]... and forbid [gerund/participial phrase 'ever speaking']...\" simplifies this complex grammatical structure by using infinitives and a gerund phrase, which are more direct and less inflectionally complex in English than the sequence of subjunctives in French.","The French \"je ne sache\" employs the present subjunctive of \"savoir\" (to know). In this context, this form is more literary and less common in everyday language than the indicative \"je sais.\" The English translation \"I know\" uses the simple present indicative, which is the standard and more common verb form, simplifying the verb choice from a less common mood to a more familiar one."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P030: Dites-moi, je vous prie, une chose, dit la Marquise.

The English translation simplifies these to more common and direct verb forms: 'imagine' (present indicative instead of subjunctive imperfect 's'imaginassent'), 'are inchanted' (present indicative passive instead of subjunctive imperfect passive 'fussions ensorcelez'), and 'go down to spoil' (present indicative form instead of subjunctive imperfect 'allassions gâter'). This reduces grammatical complexity for the reader.","The French \"sans que nous leur en fassions?\" uses the pronoun \"en\" to elliptically refer to \"peur\" (fear) from the context of \"nous feront-ils peur\". The English translation \"more than we have to scare them?\" makes the comparison more explicit by repeating the verb \"to scare\" and its object, thereby simplifying the pronominal reference and making the structure less dense.","The French conditional \"Je croirois\" (I would believe/think) is simplified to the present indicative \"I believe\" in English.

(I am speaking to you of...). The English translation simplifies this to the impersonal and more direct ''tis...', reducing the sentence's initial complexity and personal address.","The French 'un peu trop gaye' (a little too gay) includes the qualifier 'un peu' (a little), softening the judgment. The English 'only too much Gayty,' by not directly translating 'un peu,' presents the 'gayety' as more definitively 'too much,' simplifying the nuanced degree expressed in the original.","The French 'Voicy de quoy il s'agit' (literally, 'Here is of what it is a matter') is a standard but slightly more elaborate phrase to introduce a topic. The English 'The Story is thus,' is a very concise and conventional narrative opener, simplifying the original French phrasing into a more direct and formulaic expression.","The French '& aussi-tôt voilà un Chariot de feu' (and immediately, behold/there is a Chariot of fire) uses the presentative 'voilà' to create a sense of immediacy and direct observation. The English 'and they had presently at hand a Chariot of Fire' translates this into a more narrative and less vivid description of availability. This simplification reduces the original's dramatic presentational style in favor of a more conventional narrative statement.","The French text employs anaphora by repeating 'd'autres' (other) before each of the four listed items: 'd'autres fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts'. The English translation begins this pattern with 'other Rivers, other Lakes,' but then omits 'other' for the subsequent corresponding items ('Towns and Forrests'), simplifying the list's structure and reducing the original's stylistic parallelism and emphatic effect.","The French original utilizes polysyndeton, repeating the conjunction '&' (and) before each item in the extensive list. This creates a flowing, emphatic, and cumulative effect. The English translation largely omits these repeated conjunctions, opting for a standard comma-separated list with 'and' only before the final item.

Je croy que l'Arioste les met en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune.</span></span> Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">à quelque temps delà.</span></span> Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre?

Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres.</span></span> Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer;</span></span> mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">En recompense, répondit la Marquise,</span></span> nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne.

Were there none but you, Madam, said I, all those that have been address'd to you, are fled thither, and they are enough to make a considerable body. In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it. But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon. They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable.

The English 'they are enough to make a considerable body' uses a more direct and simpler sentence structure.","The French introductory phrase 'C'est que...' (It is that...) is rendered as the more colloquial 'The thing is...'. Additionally, the somewhat formal impersonal construction 'on ne sauroit dire' (one cannot say / it's impossible to say) is simplified to the more direct and common 'no man knows.'","The French poses a rhetorically complex question: 'guess what sort of thing one does *not* find in the Moon,' with the answer 'Folly,' which context reveals is abundant. The English changes this to a straightforward 'guess you what sort of thing *is* to be found in the Moon. Folly,' removing the original's rhetorical subtlety and potential irony, thereby simplifying the intended effect.","The transitional phrase 'En recompense' (in compensation/on the other hand), which provides a nuanced logical link, is omitted in the English translation. This simplifies the connection between sentences by removing the explicit marker of contrast or balance.","The French 'il n'est pas possible que... je ne vous fasse avoir' expresses a strong certainty ('it's impossible that I *won't* make you have...'). The English ''tis not impossible but that... I shall procure you' (meaning 'it is possible that I shall procure you') softens this to mere possibility. This reduction in assertive strength simplifies the original's emphatic tone and complex negative construction.","The French 'à quelque temps delà' is a somewhat formal and slightly archaic temporal expression meaning 'some time after that' or 'a while later'. The English 'sometime after' is more direct and common, simplifying the original phrasing.","The French 's'il faut que la chose continuë' (if it is necessary that the thing continue) uses a strong modal of necessity. The English 'if matters continue' is less emphatic about this necessity and uses the more general 'matters' for 'la chose' (the thing), resulting in a smoother and slightly less forceful, thus simplified, expression.","The French verb 'recueillir' (to gather, collect) is translated as 'to take.' 'Take' is a more common and simpler verb than 'gather' or 'collect' in this context, simplifying the vocabulary.","The French relative clause 'qui sachent le recouvrer' (that know how to recover it/them), modifying 'lévres' (lips), is simplified to an infinitive phrase 'to recover them.' This makes the English sentence structure more concise and direct.","The French 'En recompense' (In compensation / In return) is translated as 'To make amends.' 'To make amends' is a common English idiom that simplifies the slightly more formal 'En recompense' in this conversational context, making the meaning more immediately accessible.","The French uses a formal, inverted, and emphatic structure: 'à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve' (scarcely are they Men, the Inhabitants that one finds there). The English translation 'we find the Inhabitants scarce Men' simplifies this into a more direct subject-verb-object construction, enhancing readability.","The French emphatic impersonal construction 'ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit' (it would no longer be Men that one would find there) is simplified to a more direct predicate structure 'would not find them Men at all.' The English active subject ('he') is drawn from the preceding clause (translating 'qui pourrait pousser jusqu'à la Lune'), streamlining this part of the sentence by avoiding the French cleft sentence."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience?

This represents a lexical simplification, reducing the specificity of the original vocabulary.","The French adverb \"incessamment\" (incessantly, constantly) is simplified to the more common and less intense English adverb \"daily.\" This uses more familiar vocabulary and slightly tones down the original's emphasis on unceasing self-observation.","The strong French negation \"point d'inquietude\" (no unease/worry at all) is rendered as the slightly less emphatic \"are you not concern'd.\" Furthermore, the addition of \"too\" makes an implicit logical connection explicit, simplifying the argument's structure for the reader to enhance clarity.","The French relative clause \"dont ils occupent...\" (of which they occupy...) is simplified.

Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">s'y délassoient.</span></span> Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit</span></span>, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">quelque vaste qu'elle fût</span></span>, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">l'aveu que vous en faites</span></span>. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes</span></span>; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre.</span></span> A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires.</span></span> L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter?</span></span> Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur;</span></span> &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Nouvelle reformation à la Carte,</span></span> nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune.</span></span> Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites.</span></span> J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. Ah! vous me soulagez, répliqua la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal</span></span>, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P033: Oh! says she I reckon the Inhabitants of the Terra Australis as known; for 'tis certain they must needs resemble us very much, and in fine, we may know them when ever we take the pains to go see them, there they are and cannot avoid us; but the people of the Moon, we shall never know, 'tis that I despair of. If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it.

Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray.

Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe</span></span>, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voilà le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur.</span></span> Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point.

Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire.

A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">pour pouvoir être veuës</span></span>, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">en pluyes</span></span>.

Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien</span></span>, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.

The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not. From the moment that we have an interior motion in the parts of the Moon, or produc'd found by foreign causes, the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd, and we have a fund necessary for their subsistance.

The English translation simplifies this by using a more concise inverted conditional ('were there no such difficulty') for the first part and links the second condition with 'and that,' streamlining the parallel conditional clauses and reducing structural repetition.","The French uses the vivid metaphorical phrase 'a pour prison l'air qu'il respire' (literally, 'has for a prison the air he breathes'). The English simplifies this by replacing the specific metaphor 'a pour prison' with the more direct and less figurative verb phrase 'is confin'd to.' Additionally, the descriptive 'l'air qu'il respire' (the air he breathes) is rendered as the slightly more general 'his own Air,' reducing figurative richness and specific detail for more straightforward phrasing.","The French idiomatic phrasal connector 'A ce compte,' (meaning 'on this account' or 'consequently') is simplified to the single, common English conjunction 'therefore.' This substitution enhances readability by using a more direct and standard logical connective.","The French structure involves a subject described by a relative clause with a conditional verb ('qui seroit arrivé') and a main verb ('se noyeroit') followed by a subordinate temporal clause ('dés qu'il entreroit'). The English simplifies this complex structure by: 1) recasting the initial subject and its conditional arrival as a more direct inverted conditional clause ('should an Inhabitant... venture'), and 2) replacing the temporal subordinate clause ('dés qu'il entreroit') with a simpler prepositional phrase ('at his first arrival').

The translation \"by the same degrees declining\" is more prosaic, losing imagery, and \"prepares you for his absence\" is more common and less resonant, simplifying vocabulary and richness.","The French word \"l'éclat\" signifies brilliance, radiance, or dazzling quality. The translation simplifies this to \"the Light,\" a more general and less intense term, reducing the richness of the original imagery.","The French \"vous voilà tombés\" (literally \"there you are, fallen\") conveys a sudden realization of being in a state. The English \"you drop into\" is more active and direct, simplifying the somewhat more dramatic and stative construction of the original.","The French \"Je n'aurois pas grand regret à\" (I would not have great regret for) uses a conditional mood. The English translation \"I am not much concern'd\" simplifies this to a direct present tense statement, making it less formal and more immediate.","The French \"ny Foudres ny Tonnerres\" (literally \"neither thunderbolts/lightning strikes nor thunders\") is simplified to the standard English pairing \"neither Thunder nor Lightning.\" This uses a common idiomatic phrase, potentially losing some of the distinctness of the original terms.","The French sentence \"On n'a point de nuits où toutes les Etoiles ne se montrent\" (literally, \"One has no nights where all the Stars do not show themselves\") uses a complex double negative construction. The English translation simplifies this structure to the direct affirmative statement \"the Stars are visible all night.\"","The French \"trouvez-vous qu'on soit tant à plaindre?\" (do you find that one is so much to be pitied?) is a nuanced question about being pitiable. The English \"What reason do you find then of Complaint?\" simplifies this by framing the question in more common, direct terms of 'complaint'.","The French adjective \"délicieux\" (delightful, exquisite) and noun \"ardeur\" (ardor, intense heat) are stronger than their English counterparts. The translation uses \"pleasant\" instead of \"délicieux,\" and while \"scorching\" is strong, the overall phrasing simplifies the original's descriptive force by choosing more common vocabulary for \"délicieux\".","The French text \"car ce ne sont point des Vallées qui soient entre des Montagnes,\" (for they are not Valleys that are between Mountains) clearly negates the presence of valleys between mountains. The English translation \"for they are not mountains?\" simplifies this by omitting reference to \"Vallées\" and the relational clause \"qui soient entre des Montagnes,\" significantly reducing descriptive detail and changing the object of negation.","The French \"une Ville\" (a City) is translated as \"a Town.\" \"Town\" often implies a smaller scale or lesser status than \"City.\" This change to a more common term can be seen as a simplification of the implied grandeur.","The French \"il y a des chemins soûterrains pour la communication des Peuples\" (there are subterranean paths for the communication of Peoples) uses an existential construction. The English \"they communicate by subterraneous ways\" simplifies this to a more direct active voice sentence, making the structure less complex.","The French uses \"puisque\" (since), establishing a specific logical connection. The English translation uses \"though,\" a concessive conjunction. This shift simplifies the original's more complex rhetorical structure by replacing a causal/inferential link with a simpler adversative one."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle.

The English 'blessed Souls' is a more compact and common religious term, simplifying the descriptive clause and omitting the 'icy' (here/on Earth) aspect which refers to their earthly life.","The French 'un endroit si fâcheux' (such a vexing/unpleasant place/situation) referring to the state of not hearing harmony is simplified to 'that trouble.' 'Trouble' is a more general and common term, reducing the specificity of 'endroit' (place) and the nuance of 'fâcheux.'","The French 'on croit avoir assez pourveu... de les avoir transportées...' (one believes to have sufficiently provided... by having transported them...) uses a complex active construction with an infinitive phrase. The English simplifies this to a more straightforward passive construction: ''tis thought sufficient provision is made... by mutually transporting them...'. This makes the sentence structure more direct.","The French 'me réjoüit quelquefois beaucoup' (sometimes greatly rejoices me) expresses a stronger, more personal emotion. The English ''tis a pleasure' is a more subdued and generalized expression, simplifying the emotional intensity and personal involvement conveyed in the original.","The French 'ramper' (to crawl, to creep) vividly depicts slow, arduous movement. The English 'to run' is a more common verb but changes the meaning to faster movement. While 'to take the pains' is retained, the specific, somewhat demeaning imagery of 'ramper' is replaced by a more general and less vivid verb, simplifying the original's evocative power.","The French 'l'Univers' (the Universe) is specific to the grand scale of cosmic observation. The English 'the World,' while sometimes used synonymously in older texts, is a more common and potentially ambiguous term, often referring to Earth. In this context, it simplifies by using a more familiar but less precise term for the vastness being discussed.","The French uses specific astronomical terms for lunar/planetary phases: 'en Croissant' (waxing/crescent) and 'en Décours' (waning). The English 'has her Increases and Decreases' uses more general, less technical vocabulary to describe the same phenomena, simplifying the terminology.","The French uses conditional perfect ('auroient êté faits' - would have been made) and conditional present ('ce seroit' - it would be; 'il y aurait' - there would be) to frame a hypothetical counter-argument. The English translation simplifies this by using present tense ('are made,' 'that's') and simple past ('was exempted'), making the proposition sound more like a factual statement being refuted rather than a complex hypothetical, thus reducing the grammatical complexity.","The French 'je ne m'y puis pas resoudre' conveys an inability to bring oneself to believe or accept something, implying a personal or internal process of conviction. The English 'I cannot concur with him' simplifies this to a more straightforward statement of disagreement with an external proposition or person, reducing the psychological nuance.","The French 'Je viens de voir le moment que...' (I have just seen the moment that/when...) is a more vivid and personal recollection from the speaker's perspective. The English 'it is not long since...' is a more impersonal and conventional phrase. Additionally, 'la Lune seroit deserte' (the Moon would be deserted - conditional mood) is simplified to 'the Moon was made a Desert' (simple past indicative), reducing the hypothetical nuance.","The French 'comment ils êtoient tous faits' uses the imperfect tense ('êtoient faits' - were made/were like), situating the description of the inhabitants within the hypothetical past conversation. The English 'how they are all made' shifts to the present tense ('are all made'), simplifying the temporal framing by presenting it as a general characteristic rather than one tied to that specific past hypothetical moment of conviction.","The French 'je ne les ay jamais si bien crûs' uses the plural pronoun 'les' (them), likely referring to 'the inhabitants' or 'the ideas about inhabitants.' The English 'I never believ'd it so much' uses the singular pronoun 'it,' simplifying the referent to a more general concept of belief, thus reducing the specificity of what was believed.","The French 'je ne laisse pas de trouver' (literally 'I do not cease to find' or 'I nevertheless find') is a slightly more elaborate and formal idiomatic construction. The English 'I think' is a more direct and common verb, simplifying the phrasing of the cognitive act.","The French 'ne sauroit apercevoir' (could not perceive, or would not know how to perceive) uses the verb 'savoir' in the conditional, expressing an inherent inability or difficulty. The English 'are not discernable' uses a descriptive adjective, which is a more straightforward and less nuanced way of stating the fact, simplifying the verbal construction.","The French 'voilà aussi-tôt...' (behold, immediately there are...) uses a presentative construction to introduce the result. The English 'and you shall presently see...' changes this to a predictive statement of what the observer will witness. This makes the cause-and-effect relationship more explicit and narratively straightforward, thus simplifying the rhetorical presentation of the outcome."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut.

This makes the statement more direct and less nuanced regarding the temporal perspective or degree of certainty.","The French impersonal construction 'Ce n'est pas à [noun] de [verb]' (It is not for [noun] to [verb]), which assigns responsibility or capability, is simplified to a more direct English structure with '[Noun] cannot [verb]'. The reporting phrases 'répondis-je' and 'said I' are standard corresponding translations.","The French phrase 'n'êst pas propre à aller' (is not suited/apt to go) conveys a sense of inherent unsuitability. This is simplified to the more straightforward modal expression 'can go no farther,' which focuses directly on ability or limitation rather than suitability.","The French 'doit avoir mise' (must have put/placed) uses a modal ('doit') combined with a perfect infinitive ('avoir mise'), indicating a strong logical inference about a past action. This is simplified to 'has wrought,' a verb in the present perfect tense, removing the explicit modality of inference.","The French 'si vous voulez,' (if you wish/like) is a conversational, polite interjection that directly addresses the interlocutor. This is simplified to 'for example,', a more standard, impersonal, and purely functional discourse marker, reducing the conversational texture of the original.","The French impersonal construction with the conditional 'il faudroit encore trouver' (one would still need to find / it would be necessary to find) expresses a more definite need or desirability. This is simplified to 'we may yet find,' which shifts to a personal subject ('we') and expresses possibility ('may') rather than necessity, simplifying both the grammatical structure and the modal sense.","The French 'doit avoir eu' (must have had) expresses a strong inference about a past possession or state using a modal verb plus a perfect infinitive. The English 'should Nature have' simplifies this complex past modal construction by using a simpler modal ('should') and a simple infinitive ('have'), reducing the tense complexity and potentially weakening the original modal force.","The French reflexive verb 'se ressemblent' (resemble each other/themselves) explicitly indicates reciprocity.

The dense French prepositional phrase \"faute d'en connoître d'autres\" (for lack of knowing others), which includes an infinitive, is rendered as a simpler and more explicit subordinate clause \"because we know no other,\" enhancing readability by clarifying the causal relationship.","The translation simplifies the text by omitting the adverb \"toûjours\" (always). This removal of the temporal qualifier reduces the textual density and detail concerning the constancy of the desolation.","The text is simplified by reducing its density. The qualifying French prepositional phrase \"au milieu de cette Paix\" (in the midst of this Peace) is omitted in the English translation, making the statement more direct and less contextually detailed.","The vocabulary is simplified by using a more common and general term. The French \"s'ennuyer\" conveys a specific state of boredom or ennui. The English \"are uneasie\" is a broader term for discomfort, thereby reducing the lexical specificity and nuance of the original.","The grammatical structure is simplified. The French future perfect tense \"elle l'aura ... pratiqué\" (she will have ... practiced), used to express strong probability or a general truth with a particular temporal nuance, is translated to the more common and direct English present perfect \"she has ... done,\" reducing grammatical complexity.","The translation simplifies the tense and modality. The French future perfect \"se sera bien souvenuë\" (will have well remembered), which conveys strong assurance and thoroughness regarding a past or general state, is simplified to the more direct simple past tense \"did not at all forget.\" This change reduces both grammatical complexity and the specific nuance conveyed by \"bien\" (well/thoroughly) and the future perfect.","The French construction \"qu'elle a de diversifier ... & de les égaler\" (that she has of diversifying ... and of equalizing them), which uses infinitives to define a characteristic of the \"secret,\" is simplified. The English uses a more concise prepositional phrase with gerunds/participial phrases: \"in working a variety ... and ... making them equal.\" This reduces clausal complexity by transforming the adjectival clause defining the secret's nature into a more direct adjectival prepositional phrase."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Vous ay-je dubité assez de chimeres?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Vrayment, répondit-elle, il me semble que j'ay presentement moins de peine à attraper les differences de tous ces Mondes.</span></span> Mon imagination travaille sur le plan que vous mavez donné.

This omission reduces textual density and a layer of emphasis, simplifying the statement.","The French concessive adverb \"pourtant\" (nevertheless, however, yet) is omitted in the English translation. This simplifies the sentence by removing the explicit concessive nuance and a connecting word, making the statement more direct.","The French phrase \"d'en laisser le soin\" (literally \"to leave the care of them/it\") is structurally simplified to \"to remit them.\" The English uses a single verb (\"remit\") with a direct object (\"them\"), replacing the French construction that involves a noun (\"le soin\" - the care) and the pronoun \"en\" (of it/them). This results in a more concise and grammatically simpler structure.","In the latter part of this sentence, the French dependent clause \"comment sont faits les Habitants\" (how the Inhabitants are made/formed) is simplified to the noun phrase \"[of] the Shape of the Inhabitants.\" This conversion from a clausal structure to a prepositional phrase using \"Shape\" reduces syntactic complexity and makes the idea more concrete and arguably easier to grasp."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P054: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">QUATRIEME SOIR.

'Toûjours' is narrowed to 'only,' and the abstract 'what one sees here' becomes the more concrete and personal 'what we had seen,' reducing abstraction to enhance clarity.","The complex French word order in the subordinate clause, where the object ('ce que') precedes the verb ('reprochent') and the subject ('de certains Peuples'), is restructured in English to a more standard subject-verb-object sequence ('as those people who... reproch us...'). This simplifies the syntax, making the relationship between elements clearer and improving readability.","The French impersonal construction 'Il falut' (it was necessary) combined with the reflexive verb 'se resoudre à' (to resolve oneself to) is translated into a personal construction 'We were fain then to be...'. This change simplifies the grammatical structure by making the agency direct and avoiding the impersonal form, which can be more complex for English readers.","The French phrase 'le Voyage des Mondes' (the Voyage of the Worlds, plural) is translated as 'the Voyage... about the World' (singular). This alteration simplifies the text by reducing the explicit plurality of 'Mondes' to a singular 'World,' potentially diminishing the immediate reinforcement of the book's theme of multiple worlds and thus reducing conceptual density in this specific phrase.","The French sentence begins with 'Come' (As/Since), establishing a causal link within a single complex sentence structure ('Come A, B'). The English translation rephrases this by splitting it into two more distinct clauses linked by 'therefore' ('A, therefore B'). This structural change makes the logical connection more explicit and simplifies the sentence by breaking down its complexity for easier comprehension.","The French term 'grandeur' (size, magnitude, greatness), which can carry a more formal or even scientific connotation in discussions of astronomy, is translated as 'bigness.'

Additionally, the vivid, metaphorical French \"ils soûpirent après la nuit\" (they sigh/long for the night) is rendered as the more formal and less imagistic \"they are very desirous of the night,\" simplifying the expression by reducing its stylistic richness and figurative language.","The French phrase \"bien peu de lumière\" means \"very little light.\" The English translation \"little Light\" omits the intensifier \"bien\" (very), simplifying the expression by reducing its degree of specificity and thereby its textual density.","The French sentence \"même il doit y en avoir beaucoup qui disparoissent entierement\" (there must even be many [of them] that disappear entirely) is a relatively complex construction involving a modal verb (\"doit\"), an existential phrase, and a relative clause. The English translation \"and many are not seen at all\" significantly simplifies this structure to a more direct statement using a passive voice and changes \"disparoissent\" (disappear) to the simpler concept of \"are not seen,\" reducing both syntactic and lexical complexity.","The French phrase \"Je suis bien faché de voir\" (I am very annoyed/upset/sorry to see) expresses a strong, direct emotion. The English translation \"I am not well pleas'd to see\" uses litotes to convey displeasure in a more moderate and understated manner. This simplification reduces the intensity of the expressed emotion, making it less stark.","The French relative clause \"celles qui me resteroient\" (those [stars] that would remain for me/to me) is simplified to the more concise noun phrase \"the rest.\" This reduces grammatical complexity and the length of the phrase, making the sentence structure simpler."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P059: Je ne suis pas si touchée, dit la Marquise, de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">cette perte-là que sont les Habitans de Mercure</span></span>, que de l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de chaleur. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Je voudrois bien que nous les soulageassions un peu.</span></span> Donnons à Mercure de longues &amp; d'abondantes pluyes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">qui le rafraîchissent</span></span>, comme on dit qu'il en tombe icy dans les Pays chauds pendant des quatre mois entiers, justement dans les saisons les plus chaudes.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P055: I am not, said the Marchioness, so much concern'd at that loss of the Inhabitants of Mercury, as at the inconveniences they suffer by the extremity of Heat.

The translation simplifies this by employing the more direct and common English genitive construction 'that loss of the Inhabitants of Mercury,' which clarifies the relationship and makes the sentence structure more straightforward.","The translation of 'Je voudrois bien que nous les soulageassions un peu.' as 'I wish we could procure their ease;' omits the nuance conveyed by 'un peu' (a little). This simplifies the original statement by removing a qualifier, thereby reducing its semantic density and making the expressed wish seem more absolute.","The French text states that the rains 'le rafraîchissent' (refresh *it*, with 'le' referring to the planet Mercury).

The English 'the cause is clear' replaces this nuance with a direct, unambiguous assertion, simplifying the original's complex rhetorical posture for straightforwardness.","The French 'de là elle revient à la rencontre de tout ce qui est solide' (from there it returns to meet/encounter all that is solid) describes the light's movement towards objects.

The English 'is hard to say' uses a more common and much milder expression, simplifying the original by reducing the intensity of the stated perplexity.","The French 'on s'en desabusa' (one was disabused of it/one's illusion was shattered) describes an active process of realizing an error. The English 'that opinion vanish'd' uses a more passive and less vivid verb, simplifying the description of how the prior belief was overturned by focusing on the opinion's disappearance rather than the cognitive act of disillusionment.","The French sentence includes the clause '& qu'enfin les nouvelles Planetes s'étoient mises à la mode' (and that finally the new planets had come into fashion), which adds a specific social commentary on the influence of trends.

The English \"are as long as\" simplifies this by making the comparison more concrete and directly related to duration, clarifying the meaning of equivalence.","The translation omits the specific quantitative detail \"cinq fois\" (five times) present in the original French. This is a simplification by reducing the informational density of the text.","The French phrase \"un peu moins grand & moins vif\" (a little less big & less bright) offers a nuanced degree of comparison. The English \"neither so big nor so bright as we\" simplifies this by removing the qualifier \"un peu\" (a little), making the negative comparison more absolute and less nuanced.","The French \"ne vaut pas trop la peine qu'on s'y arrête\" (is not too much / not very worth the trouble that one stops there) includes the mitigator \"trop\" (too much/very).

The translation simplifies this by rendering the conditional as a direct, conversational question \"must my Head turn round?\" and \"il est beau\" as the more common \"'twill be pleasant.\" This simplifies both sentence structure and vocabulary, making the Marquise's remark more immediate and less formal.","The translator simplifies the original \"rendre folle\" (to drive mad/crazy) to \"fooling me.\" This uses more common and less intense vocabulary, reducing the dramatic impact of the Marquise's exclamation and making it more benign.","The French \"je ne connois plus de retenuë\" (I no longer recognize/admit any restraint/reserve) is simplified. The translation \"nor muse longer\" uses simpler vocabulary and a less forceful concept (ceasing to ponder rather than abandoning all restraint), reducing the original's portrayal of the Marquise's decisive enthusiasm.","The idiomatic French expression \"laissons parler le monde\" (let people talk/ignore gossip) is simplified to the literal phrase \"let us leave talking of the World.\" This simplification removes the cultural nuance of defying societal judgment, replacing it with a more straightforward (but semantically different) suggestion to change the topic of conversation.","The figurative French \"donnons-nous aux Tourbillons\" (let's give ourselves/devote ourselves to the Vortices), which conveys enthusiastic immersion, is simplified to the more literal and direct instruction \"begin with these Vortices.\" This reduces the richness and literary charm of the original expression.","The French definitional structure \"Ce qu'on appelle X, c'est Y\" (What one calls X, it is Y) is simplified to the direct English \"X is Y\".

This change streamlines the sentence by removing the reference to the philosopher's direct speech and makes the description more concise.","The French verb \"agiter\" (to agitate, stir, shake, disturb) is translated using the more general and common English verb \"move.\" This simplifies the vocabulary by choosing a less specific term, potentially reducing some of the vividness of the original's imagery of disturbance.","The French construction \"irions- nous soumettre à notre domination Mercure & Venus\" (literally, \"perhaps we would go to subject Mercury & Venus to our domination\") is a relatively complex and formal phrasing, introducing the object \"Mercure & Venus\" after the main verbal idea. The English translation restructures this to \"bring Mercury and Venus... into subjection to us,\" placing the object (along with its descriptive clause) between \"bring\" and \"into subjection.\" This employs the more common verb \"bring\" and a standard English phrasal structure (\"bring [someone/something] into subjection\"). This simplifies the elaborate verbal idea expressed by \"irions-nous soumettre\" and lessens the formality of the original expression, while also altering sentence flow around the object.","The French adjective \"entreprenante,\" which means enterprising, adventurous, or prone to undertaking actions, is translated as \"bold.\" \"Bold\" is a more common and general term. This choice simplifies the vocabulary by using a word with a broader meaning, thereby slightly reducing the nuance of proactive agency and initiative conveyed by \"entreprenante.\"","The impersonal French construction \"Qu'on mette\" (Let one put / If one puts) is translated using a direct address, \"if you lay.\" This shift from the impersonal \"on\" to the second-person \"you\" simplifies the sentence by making the agent explicit (the reader). This enhances readability and direct engagement, a common simplification strategy in popular science writing.","Similar to the previous instance, the impersonal French \"Qu'on y mette\" (Let one put there / If one puts there) is simplified by employing the direct address \"if you add.\" This change makes the instruction more conversational and easier for the reader to follow. The verb \"add\" is also a very common and simple choice.","The impersonal French constructions \"Qu'on mette encore\" (Let one again put) and \"qu'on y plonge\" (let one plunge/immerse there) are simplified into direct imperative forms: \"put together\" and \"put in.\" This makes the instructions more direct and active for the reader. Furthermore, the specific verb \"plonge\" (plunge, immerse) is replaced by the more common and general phrasal verb \"put in,\" which constitutes a vocabulary simplification. The addition of \"unmixed\" to clarify \"qui se tiennent separées\" (that keep themselves separate) is an explicitation aimed at easier understanding.","The French text includes the conversational phrase \"& vous voyez bien que\" (and you see clearly/well that), which directly engages the Marquise (and by extension, the reader), reinforcing the point.

The abstract \"il faut bien remplacer\" (it is necessary to replace) is rendered by the more concrete and idiomatic English phrase \"but must pay for it,\" using more common vocabulary to express the idea of a necessary trade-off.","The impersonal French construction \"Il le faut de necessité absolue\" (It is necessary by absolute necessity) is simplified to the more direct demonstrative construction \"That is of absolute necessity,\" making the sentence onset structurally simpler.","The French idiomatic expression \"n'avoit garde de craindre\" (took care not to fear / was far from fearing) is simplified to the direct negation \"he fear'd not.\" This replaces a more nuanced idiom with a straightforward statement, enhancing readability.","The French \"croiriez-vous bien\" (would you indeed believe / would you really believe) is simplified to \"would you believe.\" The emphatic adverb \"bien\" (indeed, really) is omitted, reducing the emphasis and making the question more direct and less lexically dense.","The French sentence segment \"Si en sortant de son logis la premiere personne qu'il rencontroit êtoit une Vieille\" (If, upon leaving his lodging, the first person he met was an Old Woman) uses a conditional clause containing a participial phrase (\"en sortant\"). The English translation simplifies this structure by creating a temporal clause \"When he went...\" followed by a conditional clause \"if the first person...\", making the syntax less dense.","The French phrase \"sans oser commencer la moindre chose\" (without daring to begin the slightest thing), a subordinate prepositional phrase with an infinitive, is simplified into a coordinate clause \"and not dare to take in hand the least matter.\" This change from subordination to coordination makes the sentence structure more linear and easier to follow."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit- elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">après que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.</span></span> Nous ne leur ferons pas de quartier, ils subiront la Loy commune, &amp; donneront dans quelque autre erreur, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">mais comme je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner</span></span>, éclaircissez-moy, je vous prie, une autre difficulté qui m'occupe depuis quelques moments.

Additionally, the idiomatic French 'en fussent quittes à meilleur marché' (to get away with it more cheaply/at a better bargain) is rendered as the simpler and more direct 'should free themselves with less trouble,' using more common vocabulary.","The French phrase 'je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner,' which implies a certain sophisticated detachment ('I don't pride myself on being able to guess it' or 'I don't make a point of it'), is simplified in English to the more colloquial, direct, and less formal 'I trouble not my head to guess.' This involves a shift to more common vocabulary and a simpler idiomatic construction.","The French sentence employs the subjunctive mood ('soyons') along with the 'ne explétif' after 'craindre que' (to fear that), a grammatical construction that can add complexity.

Firstly, the French \"point trop agreable\" (literally \"not too pleasant,\" implying \"rather unpleasant\") is rendered as \"not very satisfactory.\" This lexical choice shifts the nuance from a direct emotional quality (\"pleasantness\") to a more detached assessment (\"satisfactoriness\"), potentially simplifying the original's specific affective tone for the reader. Secondly, the phrase \"de dedans Jupiter\" (from within Jupiter) is simplified to \"from Iupiter,\" omitting the word \"dedans\" (within). This reduction in spatial specificity makes the expression less dense and more direct.","The French phrase \"comme les nôtres le sont vers luy\" (literally, \"as ours are so towards him,\" implying they are pointed/directed towards him) is concise and relies on the context of the previously mentioned action of aiming telescopes. The English translation \"as ours are to behold him\" simplifies this by making the implied purpose of the telescopes explicit with the addition of \"to behold him.\" This reduces the inferential load on the reader, enhancing readability.","The French \"les Planetes\" (the Planets) within the clause \"avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considèrent\" (with which the Planets consider each other) is translated as \"the two Planets\" in the English phrase \"of the two Planets in considering one another.\" This specification (referring contextually to Earth and Jupiter) makes the interaction clearer and less ambiguous than the potentially more general French term, thereby simplifying comprehension. The structural shift from a relative clause to a prepositional phrase with a gerund also tends to create a more direct construction in English."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P075: Cela ne va pas si vite que vous pensez, répliquay-je.

Its omission in the English \"Ah! says I\" simplifies the expression by removing this emphatic element.","The French \"il faudroit bien que vous vous accoûtumassiez\" (it would really be necessary that you accustom yourself), a complex modal construction involving a conditional verb (\"faudroit\") governing a subjunctive mood (\"vous accoûtumassiez\"), is simplified to the more direct English modal phrase \"you would accustom your self.\"","The idiomatic French superlative \"convient le plus juste du monde\" (fits as perfectly as possible/fits most precisely in the world) is simplified to the more common and less emphatic \"agrees very well,\" reducing the original's intensity and idiomatic richness.","The French conditional \"je n'oserois en mettre là\" (I would not dare to put any there) is simplified to the present indicative \"I dare not place any there.\" This change reduces the hypothetical nuance of the conditional, making the statement more direct and grammatically simpler.","The French sentence uses a series of imperfect subjunctive verbs (\"n'êtoit,\" \"se suivissent,\" \"eussent,\" \"fussent\") to describe a complex hypothetical situation.

This shift away from the consistent use of imperfect subjunctives reduces grammatical complexity, particularly in the rendering of \"qui se suivissent de fort prés, & eussent un mouvement égal\" (who followed each other very closely, and had an equal motion) as \"that follow one another very close with an equal motion,\" which uses an indicative verb and a prepositional phrase instead of two parallel subjunctive verbs.","The French \"un éclat & une chaleur bien foible\" describes both brightness/shine (\"éclat\") and heat (\"chaleur\") as \"bien foible\" (very feeble/weak). The translation \"a little glittering and a feeble heat\" simplifies \"éclat bien foible\" (very weak/feeble brightness) to \"a little glittering.\" This uses a more common, arguably less intense, descriptive phrase for the \"éclat,\" simplifying the original's adjectival force.","The French \"suër à grosses gouttes\" (to sweat profusely / sweat with large drops) provides a specific physiological detail.

The English translation simplifies this into a more direct subject-verb-object structure ('our World has one real convenience') followed by a standard 'that' clause. This alteration streamlines the sentence flow and removes the emphatic but structurally more complex 'c'est que' construction. Additionally, the omission of the intensifier 'fort' (very) from 'fort réelle' (very real) to 'real convenience' represents a minor lexical simplification, making the statement more direct.","The French conditional phrase 'Si vous m'en croyez' (literally, 'If you believe me about it/in this') is simplified to the direct imperative 'Believe me.' This change reduces the phrase's length and syntactic complexity, making the philosopher's interjection more concise and assertive.","The French phrase 'Voila bien d'autres sujets de reconnoissance que ceux que vous tirez de...' is simplified by replacing the formal and abstract noun phrase 'sujets de reconnoissance' (subjects/reasons for gratitude) with the more explicit and common 'things to be acknowledg'd as advantages.' The verb 'tirez de' (draw/derive from) is replaced by the more common 'receive.' Furthermore, the comparative structure 'bien d'autres... que...' (many other... than...) is changed to the simpler additive conjunction 'as well as...', which reduces the comparative nuance and makes the relationship between the ideas easier to process."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P084: Mon Dieu! répliqua-t-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">laissez-moy avoir de la reconnaissance sur tout</span></span>, jusque sur le Tourbillon où je suis placée.

The translation \"let me acknowledge all\" simplifies this by using the more common and less semantically rich verb \"acknowledge,\" reducing the original's emotional depth for greater directness and easier comprehension.","The French \"Si on ne vouloit que\" uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" and the imperfect indicative \"vouloit\" (wanted/were to want), implying a more general or attenuated hypothetical condition. The English \"If we desire only\" simplifies this by using a personal pronoun \"we\" and the present indicative \"desire,\" making the statement more direct and less nuanced in its temporal and modal aspects.","The French phrase \"on les attendroit long-temps,\" meaning \"one would wait for them for a long time,\" which includes an impersonal pronoun (\"on\") and a conditional verb (\"attendroit\"), is simplified to the very concise verb phrase \"stay long.\" This significantly reduces the length and structural complexity of the original expression.","The French \"si on vous proposoit,\" employing the impersonal pronoun \"on\" and the imperfect subjunctive \"proposoit\" (proposed/were to propose) to convey a hypothetical condition, is simplified to \"if I propose.\" This change to a personal pronoun (\"I\") and the present indicative mood (\"propose\") makes the condition more direct, personal, and less grammatically complex.","The French \"que vous vous borneriez à nous?\" (that you would limit/content yourself with us?), which uses a conditional reflexive verb (\"se borner à\") to express a nuanced commitment, is simplified to \"and will be of our side.\" The English phrase uses a simpler verb tense (future simple) and a common, more straightforward idiom, thereby reducing stylistic complexity and altering the original nuance from contentment/limitation to allegiance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">CINQUIEME SOIR.

('or if I see where you want to lead me?'), which details her dawning realization of the philosopher's argument, is translated to the more general phrase 'whether I go, or whether you lead me,'. This simplification streamlines the Marquise's expression, making it more assertive and less psychologically nuanced by omitting the specific cognitive act of 'seeing' or understanding the argument's direction.","The French phrase 'qu'elle éclairera' (that it will illuminate) explicitly repeats the detail that each fixed star would illuminate its own planets, thereby creating a rhetorical parallel with the earlier statement about the Sun illuminating its planets. The English translation 'have the like?' simplifies this by using a general pronominal phrase ('the like').

The English translation simplifies this complex syntactic structure by effectively breaking it down. The first part, \"you are fain to call them...\", directly states the expression (tying it to the preceding question about the expression used), and then a new main clause, \"You must confess that...\", introduces the consequence for \"us.\" This division reduces the syntactic density of the original sentence, making the argument's progression easier to follow.","The French \"Il faut qu'Alexandre ne l'ait pas su\" uses a common but slightly indirect modal construction (\"It must be that Alexander did not know it\") to express strong probability or deduction. The English translation rephrases this as a more direct assertion \"Alexander... certainly knew nothing of them\", simplifying the grammatical complexity of the epistemic modality and making the statement more straightforward.","The French \"c'eût eté faire trop mal sa Cour que de luy en parler\" (it would have been too badly paying court to him to speak of them to him) is an idiomatic expression with specific cultural connotations of courtly behavior and diplomacy. The English translation \"it had been an ill Complement to have told him of them\" simplifies this by replacing the nuanced, culturally-specific idiom with a more general and universally understandable phrase for an inappropriate or impolitic remark. This makes the meaning more immediately accessible by using less culturally-bound vocabulary."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle, en riant; il se sauve de tout, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">&amp; il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal.</span></span> Mais aussi parlez- moi franchement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">votre Systême est-il bien vray?</span></span> Ne me déguisez rien, je vous garderay le secret. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Il me semble qu'il n'est appuyé que sur une petite convenance bien legere.</span></span> Une Etoile Fixe &amp; lumineuse d'elle-même comme le Soleil, par consequent il faut qu'elle soit comme le Soleil, le centre &amp; l'ame d'un Monde, &amp; qu'elle ait ses Planetes qui tournent autour d'elle. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Cela est-il d'une necessité bien absoluë?</span></span> Ecoutez, Madame, répondis-je, puis que nous sommes en humeur de mêler toûjours des folies de galanterie à nos Discours les plus serieux, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">les raisonnemens de Mathematique sont faits comme l'Amour.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Vous ne sauriez accorder si peu de chose à un Amant, que bien tôt aprés il ne faille luy en accorder davantage, &amp; puis encore davantage, &amp; à la fin cela va loin.</span></span> De même accordez à un Mathematicien le moindre principe, il va vous en tirer une consequence, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">qu'il faudra que vous luy accordiez aussi</span></span>, &amp; de cette consequence encore une autre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; malgré vous-même il vous mene si loin, qu'à peine le pouvez vous croire.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Ces deux sortes de Gens-là prennent toûjours plus qu'on ne leur donne.</span></span> Vous convenez que quand deux choses sont semblables en tout ce qui me paroît, je les puis croire aussi semblables en ce qui ne me paroît point, s'il n'y a rien d'ailleurs qui m'en empêche. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">De là j'ay tiré que la Lune êtoit habitée, parce qu'elle ressemble à la Terre, les autres Planetes, parce qu'elles ressemblent à la Lune.</span></span> Je trouve que les Etoiles Fixes ressemblent à nôtre Soleil, je leur attribuë tout ce qu'il a.

This reduces grammatical complexity, making the assertion more straightforward.","The intensifier 'bien' (truly, very), which adds a degree of emphasis or nuance to the question 'est-il bien vray?', is omitted in the English translation 'is your System true?'. This makes the question more direct and slightly less emphatic, simplifying the original's subtle stress.","The French 'bien legere' (very slight, flimsy) describing 'convenance' (aptness, fittingness) is translated to 'superficial enough.' While 'superficial' is a common analytical term, the overall phrasing 'superficial enough' simplifies the delicate nuance of 'bien legere,' rendering the criticism in a more direct and perhaps readily understood manner.","The intensifier 'bien' modifying 'absoluë' (truly/very absolute) in 'd'une necessité bien absoluë' is omitted in the English 'absolute necessity.' This simplification removes a layer of emphasis present in the original French.","The French 'sont faits comme' (are made like/are constructed as) suggests a specific structural parallel between mathematics and love. The English 'are like those of' offers a more general comparison, simplifying the nature of the analogy by reducing its specificity.","The original French employs a complex negative conditional sentence structure ('Vous ne sauriez accorder... que... il ne faille...') to describe the escalating concessions. The English translation simplifies this significantly into a direct imperative followed by a series of consequences ('grant... and you are...'), making the sentence structure much more straightforward and easier to follow. Additionally, the abstract 'cela va loin' (that goes far) is rendered by the more concrete and idiomatic 'and so to the Worlds end,' simplifying the generality.","The French modal construction 'qu'il faudra que vous luy accordiez aussi' (it will be necessary that you grant him also), which uses the future of 'falloir' plus the subjunctive, is simplified to the more direct English modal phrase 'that you must likewise grant.' This replaces a more periphrastic and grammatically complex expression of necessity with a common and simpler one.","The phrase 'malgré vous-même' (despite yourself), conveying an internal struggle or involuntary compliance, is translated as 'whether you will or not.' This simplifies the nuanced psychological state to a more common and direct expression of inevitability regardless of personal volition.","The French 'Gens-là' includes the deictic particle '-là' (there/those), adding a slight emphasis or distinguishing quality to 'Gens' (people). The English 'people' omits this nuance, resulting in a minor simplification by removing this subtle pointer.","The French text presents the reason for the other planets being inhabited in an elliptical clause ('les autres Planetes, parce qu'elles ressemblent à la Lune,' implying '[sont habitées]'). The English translation makes this explicit by adding 'are' ('and that the Planets are'), thereby resolving the ellipsis. This explicitation simplifies processing for the reader by making the grammatical structure more complete and immediately clear.","The French expression 'il faut franchir le pas de bonne grâce' is rich and idiomatic, meaning 'to take the plunge/step forward willingly/with good grace.' The English 'you must e'en go on' drastically simplifies this by reducing it to the core idea of necessary continuation, losing the metaphorical depth of 'franchir le pas' (take the step/plunge) and the specific manner of 'de bonne grâce' (with good grace/willingly). This uses much more common and less nuanced vocabulary.","The French phrase 'sur le pied de cette ressemblance' (literally 'on the foot of this resemblance,' meaning on the basis/foundation of) is a somewhat formal or figurative expression. The English 'according to this Resemblance' is a more common, straightforward, and less figurative prepositional phrase to convey a similar meaning, thus simplifying the diction."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P091: Cela est hors de doute, répondis-je.

This choice simplifies the original by replacing a broader term for obscuration with a more specific verb describing the visual impact of intense light, making the mechanism more immediately understandable.","The French phrase \"avec le reste des autres Soleils étrangers,\" (with the rest of the other foreign Suns) contains redundancy (\"le reste des autres\").

This simplifies the original by making the agent explicit (\"The people there\") rather than using the general \"On,\" thereby reducing ambiguity. Additionally, the verb \"attache\" (attaches, fastens) is rendered as the simpler \"seat\" in this metaphorical context of placing a star.","The French \"on n'y songe seulement pas.\" (one doesn't even think/dream of them) uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" and a somewhat complex negation.

The initial interrogative framing is altered to the more direct English question \"may not these Worlds differ...?\" followed by a declarative clause. Furthermore, the literary French phrase \"un fond de ressemblance ne laisse de porter des differences infinies\" (a basis of resemblance nonetheless bears/produces infinite differences) is simplified: \"un fond de ressemblance\" becomes the more common \"a Resemblance in the main,\" and the assertive \"ne laisse de porter\" (does not fail to carry/produce) is rendered as the simpler and less forceful \"may admit of,\" simplifying vocabulary, grammatical structure, and reducing the original's assertive nuance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est de deviner.

The English translation 'Can you imagine' simplifies this to a more common, direct, and structurally less complex interrogative form, enhancing readability.","The French 'Fourmiliere d'Astres' (anthill of stars) is a concise metaphor. The English translation first provides a more general rendering ('crowd of Stars') and then explicitly spells out the simile ('like Ants in their Hillock'), making the metaphorical image more accessible and requiring less interpretative effort from the reader.","The French uses the impersonal pronoun 'l'on' with the conditional verb 'sauteroit' (one would leap). The English translation simplifies this by using a concrete subject 'a man' and a more direct modal verb 'may leap,' reducing the abstraction and formality of the original phrasing.","The French impersonal pronoun 'on' followed by the conditional 'pourroit' (one could) is simplified in English to 'they may.' This makes the (implied) subject more specific ('they') and uses a simpler modal of possibility, making the sentence structure more direct.","The French sentence uses two active clauses with the impersonal pronoun 'on' ('l'on y peut dresser...' and 'comme on fait...'). The English translation simplifies this structure by making 'Pigeons' the subject of the main clause ('may be as useful'), using a passive participial phrase ('that are taught'), and omitting the second explicit impersonal action ('comme on fait'). This restructuring results in a more streamlined sentence focused on the pigeons' utility.","The French phrase 'sortent... de la regle generale' (literally 'go out from the general rule') uses a slightly more figurative and less common phrasing to express being an exception. The English translation 'are evidently an exception' uses more standard and direct vocabulary ('exception'), making the meaning immediately clearer.","The French sentence structure, with the conditional clause 'si on leur disoit que...' (if one told them that...), is simplified in the English translation. The phrase 'to hear that...' replaces the conditional clause, reducing the overall clausal complexity and making the sentence more direct.","The French 'ne voyent même qu'un seul Soleil' (literally 'they don't even see but a single Sun,' meaning 'they see only a single Sun') is an active clause describing the inhabitants' perception.

The English translation \"where we see the Suns\" simplifies this by using a locative relative adverb \"where.\" This changes the grammatical relationship to a simpler spatial one, making the sentence structure more straightforward and easier to parse than a more literal rendering of \"dont\" (e.g., \"of which\" or \"whose\").","The French sentence includes the pronominal adverb \"en\" (\"of them\"/\"thereof\"), which refers anaphorically to the previously mentioned \"Tourbillons\" (Vortices/Bowls), implying \"how can so many balls *of that kind* touch a single one?\". The English translation omits a direct equivalent for \"en.\" This omission streamlines the sentence, making it more direct and less grammatically dense.

This simplification reduces the sentence's informational density and length, making it easier to process.","The detailed French description \"taillé à facetes de tous côtéz\" (cut with facets on all sides) is simplified to \"cut into flats.\" This involves using a simpler, more common term (\"flats\" for \"facetes\") and omitting the qualifier \"de tous côtéz\" (on all sides), thus reducing specificity and stylistic complexity for easier comprehension.","The translation simplifies the original French structure. Instead of the explicit parallelism \"ici elles sont plus grandes, là plus petites\" (here they are larger, there smaller), the English uses the more concise and less grammatically complex phrase \"some great, some small,\" reducing sentence length and structural complexity.","The idiomatic French expression \"qui ménage bien le terrain\" (who manages the ground/space well, implying resourceful and efficient use of space) is translated to the more general English idiom \"who knows well how to manage the matter.\" This replaces a specific spatial metaphor with a broader, perhaps more common, expression of capability, simplifying the original nuance for increased readability.","The French idiomatic construction \"ne laissent pas d'être\" (literally \"do not cease to be,\" meaning \"are nonetheless\" or \"still are\") is simplified to the more direct and less nuanced phrase \"are only an addition of.\" This enhances readability by using a more straightforward affirmative statement and simplifying the original's stylistic complexity.","The French phrase \"ne laissent pas d'être\" (do not cease to be / are nonetheless), a somewhat literary and indirect turn of phrase, is simplified to the more common and direct English \"are yet.\" This makes the sentence more accessible by using a simpler and more frequent construction, reducing stylistic richness.","The active impersonal French construction \"on ne découvre ... qu'avec\" (one only discovers ... with) is translated into a passive voice \"are not to be seen without.\" This structural shift can simplify by making the subject (\"Suns\") more direct for an English reader. Additionally, \"Lunettes d'approche\" (literally \"approach glasses,\" meaning spyglasses or early telescopes) is rendered as \"Telescope,\" a more common and definitive term for the period's English reader, simplifying vocabulary by using a more established scientific term over a descriptive phrase.","The French \"il rentre en luy-même\" (it re-enters into itself / withdraws into itself) is translated as \"contracts it self.\" The English uses a more specific and less figurative verb (\"contracts\") to describe the physical action, simplifying the potentially more ambiguous or multi-layered meaning of \"rentre en luy-même\" and making the analogy of the bladder's behavior clearer and more direct.","The French \"on prétend que\" (one/people claim/maintain/allege that) is translated as \"'tis thought that.\" The English version uses a more general and less assertive phrasing, simplifying the nuance of \"prétendre,\" which can imply an assertion that may or may not be fully substantiated, thus softening the tone and simplifying the authorial voice."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

The English translation \"what kind of Embassadours are those?\" converts this into a direct question. This simplifies the original rhetorical form, making the expression more straightforwardly interrogative and potentially less nuanced in its emotional impact.","The French \"elle ne sert qu'à faire peur\" has \"la visite\" (the visit, implied by \"elle\") as the subject that \"serves only to scare.\" The English translation \"for they serve only to scare people\" changes the agent to the \"Embassadours\" (the \"they\"). This shift makes the agent more concrete and the action more direct, simplifying the conceptual structure from an abstract cause (the visit) to a direct action by the previously mentioned entities.","The French \"sans cesse\" (unceasingly, constantly) within the phrase \"nous reprochent sans cesse\" conveys a strong sense of continuous, relentless reproach. The English translation \"still charge us\" uses \"still,\" which, while capable of meaning \"continuously,\" is a more common and generally less emphatic term in this context. This lexical choice simplifies the original by potentially reducing the expressed intensity of the enemies' actions described in the sentence.","The French \"leur manqueroit\" uses the conditional mood (\"would be lacking to them\"), indicating a potential or future-in-the-past consequence. The English translation \"fail'd them\" uses the simple past tense. This change simplifies the verb's modality, presenting the consequence as a more definite past event rather than retaining the nuanced conditional sense of the original.","The French original begins with \"Aussi,\" a logical connective meaning \"Therefore\" or \"So,\" explicitly linking this sentence as a consequence of the previous statements. The English translation omits this explicit connective, starting directly with \"They are ever...\". This omission simplifies the text by removing an explicit marker of logical argumentation, requiring the reader to infer the connection and reducing the textual density.","The French \"Qu'ils ne s'inquietent plus\" (Let them no longer worry) is a direct exhortation. The English \"but let them not trouble their Heads\" replaces \"s'inquiéter\" (to worry) with the more colloquial and idiomatic expression \"trouble their heads.\" This use of a common idiom simplifies the vocabulary by opting for a familiar, figurative phrase over a more direct or potentially more formal term, making it more accessible while slightly altering the tone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P101: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">J'entends</span></span>, dit-elle..

This omission simplifies the clause by reducing its informational density and length."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P104: Il ne faut donc plus songer, luy dis-je, à vous donner de la pitié pour les Habitans d'une Comète, mais j'espère du moins que vous plaindrez <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">ceux qui vivent dans un Tourbillon dont le Soleil vient à s'éteindre, &amp; qui demeurent dans une nuit éternelle.</span></span> Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles Fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumière; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; car que faire sans Soleil? Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner?</span></span> Je vous diray, si vous voulez, répondis je, ce que disent <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">de fort habiles Gens</span></span>, que les Etoiles Fixes qui ont disparu ne sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est-à-dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mêmes, tantôt ils nous présentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantôt la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion-là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoître, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mêmes?</span></span> Vous êtes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur. Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">&amp; tout s'y portera bien.</span></span> Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles Fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantôt plus grandes tantôt plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus légers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile;</span></span> mais voicy un étrange malheur. Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement, des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoîtroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoître de longtemps. Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">en suite se rallument</span></span>, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours</span></span>, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa</span></span>, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même.</span></span> Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">il ne faut que du temps?</span></span> Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte;</span></span> &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">étoient de nature à ne changer jamais</span></span>, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience?</span></span> Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy</span></span>, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes;</span></span> &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">je ne les en croirois pas encore</span></span>, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer?</span></span> On n'est pas si aisément éternel. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout</span></span> pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, il faut que l'espce se repare. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse</span></span>, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">qui se rapprochent de nous</span></span> aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux.</span></span> Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu</span></span>, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">la haute idée que j'ay</span></span> des ouvrages de la Nature. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes</span></span> par une revolution continuelle?

How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</p> <p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</p> <p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature. Has not she the secret of causing Herbs and Plants to spring and dye in a continual Revolution? I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it.</p> <p>P111: In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that I have e'en left them.</p> <p>P112: Let us leave them more yet, said I, if you'l be persuaded by me, and talk no more of them; for you are now come to the highest Roof of Heaven, and to tell you whether there be Stars beyond that or not, will require more knowledge than I have. Place Worlds there, or place them not, 'twill depend upon your self.

The English \"can you no way excuse me that?\" is more direct, uses simpler syntax, and arguably more common/colloquial vocabulary for the request.","The French \"de fort habiles Gens\" (very skilled/clever people) is simplified to \"knowing men.\" \"Knowing\" is a more general and less nuanced adjective than \"fort habiles\" (very skilled/adept), using more common vocabulary.","The French \"ne se remontrent pas\" (do not show themselves again) is part of a longer complex temporal clause. The English simplifies this specific action to the more direct and concise phrase \"and were never seen since,\" reducing the descriptive complexity of their non-reappearance.","The French phrase \"tout s'y portera bien\" (everything there will be/go well) is simplified to the very common, shorter English idiom \"all's well,\" reducing text length and employing a more familiar expression.","The French \"le gros des Tourbillons\" (the bulk/mass/main part of the Vortices) is simplified to \"the great Vortices.\" \"Great\" is a more general and common adjective, simplifying the vocabulary compared to conveying the specific meaning of \"le gros de.\"","The specific French verb \"se rallument\" (re-ignite, re-light) is translated with the more periphrastic and arguably simpler phrase \"take light again,\" using more common words instead of a single, less frequent verb like \"re-ignite.\"","The French describes the crust with the additional detail \"qui s'augmentera toûjours\" (which will always keep growing). The English translation omits this characteristic (\"qui s'augmentera toûjours\"), simplifying the description of the crust.","The French \"la rompit & la dissipa\" (broke it and dissipated it) lists two distinct actions of the Sun's force. The English translation \"it was dissipated\" only conveys the second action (\"dissipa\"), omitting \"rompit\" (broke it), thus simplifying the event by reducing the number of described effects.","The French \"si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même\" (if the Sun itself is not [pale]) is simplified by the English pro-form \"be so.\" This substitution makes the sentence more concise and employs a common English structure to avoid repeating the adjective \"pale.\"","The French question \"il ne faut que du temps?\" (only time is needed? / does it only take time?) is simplified to the more direct, concise, and idiomatic English assertion \"time will do it.\"","The French relative clause \"dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte\" (of which none of its parts is entirely exempt) is restructured into the simpler English coordinate clause \"and no part of it wholly exempt,\" reducing grammatical complexity.","The French periphrastic expression \"étoient de nature à ne changer jamais\" (were of a nature never to change) is simplified to the single, more common adjective \"unchangeable,\" making the phrasing more concise and direct.","The French \"Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience?\" (Had they had the leisure to assure themselves of it by experience?) is simplified by replacing \"le loisir\" (leisure) with the more common \"time enough,\" and the reflexive \"s'en assurer\" (assure themselves of it) with the more direct \"to confirm their Opinion,\" using more straightforward vocabulary.","The somewhat abstract and impersonal French phrase \"de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy\" (in the memory of a rose, one has only seen him) is simplified to the more concrete and conventional narrative statement \"our History tells us of no other.\"","The French \"plus de fondement\" (more foundation/basis) is simplified to \"better ground,\" using a more common word. The clause \"celuy que faisoient les Anciens\" (that which the Ancients made/had) is simplified and made more explicit as \"than the Ancients had for their Opinion,\" using a simpler verb structure.","The French \"je ne les en croirois pas encore\" (I would not believe them [about that] yet), which uses the complex pronominal adverb \"en,\" is simplified to \"yet I should not believe it,\" using the simpler pronoun \"it\" and a more direct construction.","The French idiomatic interrogative \"Seroit-ce à dire que...\" (Would that be to say that... / Does this mean that...) is simplified to the more direct question form \"Can we argue that...\". This makes the sentence structure less periphrastic and easier to follow.","The impersonal French construction \"Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé...\" (It would be necessary that a thing had passed...) is simplified to the direct \"A thing must have...\". Furthermore, the descriptive phrase \"passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout\" (passed many ages of man put end-to-end) is concisely rendered as \"out-liv'd many Ages of Man,\" simplifying the structure by using a single effective verb.","The impersonal French passive construction \"Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse\" (It is not to be feared that it perishes) is simplified to the more direct, active, and common English phrasing \"There is no fear of their perishing.\"","The French verb \"se rapprochent [de nous]\" (approach [us] again/come closer [to us]) is simplified to the more common and direct verb \"return\" in the context of stars reappearing.","The French modal perfect passive \"peut avoir êté fait\" (may have been made), expressing past possibility leading to a state, is simplified to the present state \"is so made.\" This streamlines the verb phrase, making the sentence structure more direct.","The French adverbial phrase \"à la longue\" (in the long run, eventually) is simplified to the more common and concise \"at last.\"","The French \"la haute idée\" (the high idea) is translated as \"those great Ideas.\" In English, \"great idea\" is a more common and arguably simpler collocation than \"high idea\" for expressing a significant or grand concept.","The French \"faire naître\" (literally \"to make born\" or \"to give birth to\") is simplified in expression when applied to plants to \"causing...to spring.\" \"Spring\" is a more common and direct verb for the emergence of plants. The shift from the conditional \"N'auroit-elle\" (Would she not have) to \"Has not she\" (Does she not have) also makes the question more direct.","The French \"qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage\" (that it does not cost her more for it) uses the pronominal adverb \"en\" (for it/of it). The English \"and it costs her no more to do it\" makes the referent explicit with \"to do it,\" simplifying comprehension by resolving potential pronominal ambiguity.","The complex French idiom \"être revenu de quelque chose\" (to be disillusioned with/have changed one's mind about something after being disillusioned) is significantly simplified to \"I have e'en left them.\" This translation conveys detachment but simplifies by omitting the specific nuance of disillusionment and the process of changing one's opinion.","The French \"Revenons encore mieux\" (Let's get over it/move on from this topic even more completely), which continues an idiomatic sense of disillusionment, is simplified to \"Let us leave them more yet.\" \"Leave them\" is a simpler and more direct expression for ceasing discussion or mental engagement with the topic.","The French \"voûte\" (vault), a specific architectural term, is simplified to \"Roof.\" \"Roof\" is a more common and general term, making the imagery more accessible and the vocabulary simpler.","The French \"vôtre esprit\" (your mind/spirit) is simplified to the more concrete \"your thoughts.\" Additionally, the phrase \"aussi loin que vont vos yeux\" (as far as your eyes go) is rephrased to the more active and common English idiom \"as far as you can reach with your eyes,\" simplifying the expression of visual limit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Quoi, s'écria-t-elle</span></span>, j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Je suis savante!</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Oüy, répliquay-je</span></span>, vous l'êtes assez raisonnablement, &amp; vous l'êtes avec la commodité de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">dés que l'envie vous en prendra.</span></span> Je vous demande seulement pour recompense de mes peines de ne voir jamais le Soleil, ny le Ciel, ny les Etoiles, sans songer à moy.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P113: So, says she, I have now the whole System of the Universe in my Head; I am now a knowing Woman.</p> <p>P114: You are, said I, reasonable enough, and you are so with this conveniency, that you may believe nothing of all that I have said to you, till you please your self.

(What! she exclaimed!) with 'So, says she,'. This reduces emotional intensity by substituting the emphatic 'Quoi!' with the milder 'So,' and the expressive verb 's'écria' (exclaimed/cried out) with the more general 'says.'","The term 'savante' (a learned/scholarly woman) is translated to 'a knowing Woman.' 'Knowing Woman' is a more common and potentially less formal term, simplifying the specific connotation of deep erudition present in 'savante'.","The French 'Oüy, répliquay-je' (Yes, I replied) becomes 'You are, said I'. The explicit 'Oüy' (Yes) is omitted (though affirmation is implied by 'You are'), and the specific verb 'répliquay-je' (replied) is simplified to the more common verb 'said'.","The French idiomatic phrase 'dés que l'envie vous en prendra' (literally 'as soon as the desire/whim takes you') is translated to the more general 'till you please your self.' This simplifies the original's nuanced implication of acting on a spontaneous whim into a more common and less evocative expression."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: FIN</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P115: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P115: FINIS.</p>","explanations":[]}],"counts":{"manual":1,"ai":655}}
