Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">qui a plus de brillant;</span></span> mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">qui est plus touchante.</span></span> Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">&amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes.</span></span> Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais?</span></span> Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">en me regardant,</span></span> &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">mon imagination s'est échappée.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle.</span></span> Helas! répliquai-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer;</span></span> je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">donnez-la moy,</span></span> je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, répliquai-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

But 'tis the Night, said she, that hears their Complaints, and how comes it to pass, the day is so little trusted with their secrets?

While 'frais' implies the condition of the air, the target text spells this out directly.","The French text describes the narrator's personal experience: 'la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner...' (the presence of such a lovely Lady did not permit me to abandon myself...). The English translation transforms this into a general aphorism: 'but who can think long... in the Company of a Pretty Woman!'. This makes explicit the underlying gallant social trope—that a beautiful woman is a universal distraction from serious contemplation—which was only implied as the reason for the narrator's specific, personal experience in the source text.","The French 'qui a plus de brillant' (which has more brilliance/shine) is expanded in the English translation to 'is clear and dazling'. The addition of 'clear' explicitates a specific quality of this 'brillant,' providing a more detailed and explicit description of the nature of the day's brightness than was stated in the source.","The French 'qui est plus touchante' (which is more moving/touching) is translated as 'more soft and moving.' The addition of 'soft' explicitates a specific quality that contributes to why the night's beauty is 'touchante' (moving), adding a descriptive layer that is not literally present in the source term.","The French 'vous qui ne l'estes pas' (you who are not one [i.e., a brunette]) implies that the Marquise is blonde. The English translation 'You that have all the Charms that belong to the Fair:' makes this explicit by identifying her as 'Fair' (a common term for blonde) and further elaborates by adding the complimentary phrase 'all the Charms that belong to the Fair,' thus spelling out positive attributes associated with her fairness that were unstated in the source.","The French states that 'les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes' (Heroines of Romance, who are what is most beautiful in the imagination, are almost always blonde). The English translation renders this as 'The Heroines of Romances are generally fair,' and then adds a new, explanatory clause: 'and that Beauty must be perfect, which hath all the advantages of imagination.' This addition spells out a supposed reason or consequence, asserting that such beauty is deemed perfect due to its imaginative advantages, a connection not explicitly made in the source text.","The English translation prefaces the Marquise's question with 'But since you talk of Romances'. This phrase explicitly links her inquiry about lovers and the night to the philosopher's immediately preceding mention of 'Romances'. In the French text, this connection is only implied by the natural flow of conversation, whereas the English translator makes the topical link explicit.","The French 'en me regardant,' (looking at me,) is translated as 'looking earnestly upon me,'. The addition of 'earnestly' explicitates the manner or intensity of the Marquise's gaze. This intensity might be inferred from the context of her surprising question ('What Worlds?'), but it is not explicitly stated in the source text.","The French 'mon imagination s'est échappée.' (my imagination has escaped/run away.) is a somewhat metaphorical expression. The English translation 'I begin to rave:' makes explicit a specific, more extreme mental state (raving) that is interpreted from the more general idea of an 'escaped imagination,' thereby spelling out a potential consequence or manifestation of this imaginative flight.","The French text has the Marquise ask a simple question: 'Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle.' (What then is this folly? she replied.). The English translation 'what Folly, said she, I discover none?' adds the clause 'I discover none?'. This addition makes explicit the Marquise's current perception or reaction—that she does not yet perceive any folly in his words—which is entirely absent from the source text's simple inquiry.","The French 'je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer;' (I am very sorry/annoyed that I must admit it to you;) expresses a general reluctance or regret. The English translation 'I am asham'd, I must own it,' specifies a stronger and more precise emotion, 'asham'd,' making explicit a particular feeling of embarrassment that is only broadly implied by 'fâché' (sorry/annoyed) in this context.","The French 'donnez-la moy,' (give it [the folly] to me,) is a direct but somewhat abstract request in this context. The English translation 'Pray make me sensible of it;' expands this by making explicit the method by which the philosopher should 'give' her the folly: by explaining it in such a way that she can understand or perceive it ('make sensible of'). This spells out the implied action of the request."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">il fallut ceder.</span></span> Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">en matière de Physique</span></span>, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; &amp; les Planètes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des mondes. J'en revenois toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes: &amp; si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir, ce qui reviendrait au même. Mais on veut savoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyait bien, ce serait toujours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voient point, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">cette condition</span></span> n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toujours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opéra. Du lieu où vous êtes à l'Opéra, vous ne voyez pas le Théâtre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à votre veue ces roues &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvements. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">comment tout cela joue</span></span>. Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées</span></span>, &amp; elles le sont si bien qu'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers; car représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">tous ces Gens</span></span> dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyaient <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">le Vol de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">Phaéton</span></span></span></span> que les Vents enlèvent, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes</span></span>, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé</span></span>. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">une certaine Vertu secrète</span></span> qui enlève Phaéton. L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas.</span></span> L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide; &amp; cent autres rêveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenue bien mécanique? Si mécanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bientôt honte. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">On veut</span></span> que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvements régléz qui dépendent de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">l'arrangement des parties</span></span>. Avouez la vérité. N'avez-vous pas eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne méritoit? J'ay vu des gens qui l'en estimoient moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoient connu. Et moy, répliqua-t'elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sais qu'il ressemble à une Montre. Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">des choses si simples</span></span>.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P004: But in vain I excus'd my self, who could resist so many Charms? I was forc'd to yield, and yet I knew not where to begin; for to a Person who understood nothing of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">Natural Philosophy</span></span> you must go a great way about to prove that the Earth may be a Planet, the Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars worlds; however to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I at last resolv'd on this Method. All Philosophy, said I, Madam, is founded upon two things, either that we are too short sighted, or that we are too curious; for if our eyes were better than they are, we should soon see whether the Stars were worlds or not; and if on the other side we were less curious, we should not care whether the Stars are Worlds or not, which I think is much to the same purpose. But the business is, we have a mind to know more than we see: And again, if we could discern well what we do see, it would be so much known to us: But we see things quite otherwise than they are. So that your true Philosopher will not believe what he doth see, and is alwaies conjecturing at what he doth not, which is a Life I think not much to be envy'd: Upon this I fancy to my self, that Nature very much resembleth an Opera, where you stand, you do not see the Stage as really it is; but it is plac'd with advantage, and all the Wheels and Movements are hid, to make the Representation the more agreeable: Nor do you trouble your self how, or by what means the Machines are moved, tho' certainly an Engineer in the Pit is affected with what doth not touch you; he is pleas'd with the motion, and is demonstrating to himself on what it depends, and how it comes to pass. This Engineer then is like a Philosopher, tho' the difficulty is greater on the Philosophers part, the Machines of the Theatre being nothing so curious as those of Nature, which disposeth her Wheels and Springs so out of sight, that we have been long a guessing at the movement of the Universe. Suppose then the Sages at an Opera, the Pithagoras's, the Plato's, the Aristotles, and all the Wise Men who have made such a noise in the World, for these many Ages: We will suppose 'em at the Representation of Phaeton, where they see the aspiring Youth lifted up by the Winds, but do not discover the Wires by which he mounts, nor know they any thing of what is done behind the Scenes. Would you have all these Philosophers own themselves to be stark Fools, and confess ingenuously they know not how it comes to pass: No, no, they are not called Wise Men for nothing; tho', let me tell you, most of their Wisdom depends upon the ignorance of their Neighbours. Every man presently gives his Opinion, and how improbable so ever, there are Fools enough of all sorts to believe 'em: One tells you Phaeton is drawn up by a hidden Magnetick Vertue, no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question. Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra: A third tells you, Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company, with an hundred such extravagant fancies, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers</span></span>: But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera. I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it; they will have the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement. But pray tell me, Madam, had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe? Do you not think you did then honour it more than it deserv'd? For most have the less esteem of it since they have pretended to know it. I am not of their opinion, said she, I value it the more since I know it resembles a Watch, and the whole order of Nature the more plain and easie it is, to me it appears the more admirable.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P004: But in vain I excus'd my self, who could resist so many Charms?

So that your true Philosopher will not believe what he doth see, and is alwaies conjecturing at what he doth not, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">which is a Life</span></span> I think not much to be envy'd: Upon this I fancy to my self, that Nature very much resembleth an Opera, where you stand, you do not see the Stage as really it is; but it is plac'd with advantage, and all the Wheels and Movements are hid, to make the Representation the more agreeable: Nor do you trouble your self <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">how, or by what means the Machines are moved</span></span>, tho' certainly an Engineer in the Pit is affected with what doth not touch you; he is pleas'd with the motion, and is demonstrating to himself on what it depends, and how it comes to pass. This Engineer then is like a Philosopher, tho' the difficulty is greater on the Philosophers part, the Machines of the Theatre being nothing so curious as those of Nature, which <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">disposeth her Wheels and Springs so out of sight</span></span>, that we have been long a guessing at the movement of the Universe. Suppose then the Sages at an Opera, the Pithagoras's, the Plato's, the Aristotles, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">all the Wise Men</span></span> who have made such a noise in the World, for these many Ages: We will suppose 'em at <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">the Representation of Phaeton</span></span>, where they see <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">the aspiring Youth</span></span> lifted up by the Winds, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">but do not discover the Wires by which he mounts</span></span>, nor know they <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">any thing of what is done behind the Scenes</span></span>. Would you have all these Philosophers own themselves to be stark Fools, and confess ingenuously they know not how it comes to pass: No, no, they are not called Wise Men for nothing; tho', let me tell you, most of their Wisdom depends upon the ignorance of their Neighbours. Every man presently gives his Opinion, and how improbable so ever, there are Fools enough of all sorts to believe 'em: One tells you Phaeton is drawn up by <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">a hidden Magnetick Vertue</span></span>, no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question. Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra: A third tells you, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company,</span></span> with an hundred such extravagant fancies, that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers: But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera. I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">they will have</span></span> the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">the just disposing of the several parts of the movement</span></span>. But pray tell me, Madam, had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe? Do you not think you did then honour it more than it deserv'd? For most have the less esteem of it since they have pretended to know it. I am not of their opinion, said she, I value it the more since I know it resembles a Watch, and the whole order of Nature <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">the more plain and easie it is</span></span>, to me it appears the more admirable.</p>","explanations":["The French 'en matière de Physique' (in matters of Physics) is translated as 'of Natural Philosophy'. The translator makes the implicit historical scope of 'Physique' explicit by using the term 'Natural Philosophy,' which in the 17th century referred to the broad study of nature, not just physics in the modern sense.","The French 'il fallut ceder.' (it was necessary to yield/I had to yield.) states the outcome. The English translation 'I was forc'd to yield, who could resist so many Charms?' adds the clause 'who could resist so many Charms?', thereby making explicit a specific, courtly reason (her charms) for the narrator's yielding. This motivation was only subtly implied by the social context in the original French.","The French 'cette condition' (this condition), referring to the philosopher's state of doubting what is seen and guessing at what is unseen, is translated as 'which is a Life'. This explicitation clarifies that this 'condition' is being characterized as a complete way of 'Life' or existence for the philosopher.","The French 'comment tout cela joue' (literally 'how all that plays/works') refers vaguely to the functioning of the stage mechanisms. The English 'how, or by what means the Machines are moved' makes this explicit by identifying 'cela' (that) as 'the Machines' and specifying 'joue' (plays/works) as 'are moved,' also adding 'by what means' to spell out the inquiry into the mechanics.","The French 'les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées' (the ropes are perfectly well hidden) refers to the hidden workings of Nature. The English 'disposeth her Wheels and Springs so out of sight' expands on 'les cordes' (the ropes) by specifying 'Wheels and Springs,' making explicit that 'ropes' is representative of various types of hidden mechanisms.","The French 'tous ces Gens' (all these people/folk), referring to Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, is translated as 'all the Wise Men'. This makes their status as 'Wise Men' explicit, a status that is strongly implied by the context of naming renowned ancient philosophers.","The French 'le Vol de Phaéton' (the Flight of Phaeton) occurs within the context of an opera. The English 'the Representation of Phaeton' makes explicit that this is a theatrical 'representation' or performance of the flight, clarifying that the Sages are observing a stage effect, not the mythical event itself.","The French text simply names 'Phaéton'. The English translation 'the aspiring Youth' adds a descriptive character trait ('aspiring') that is commonly associated with the mythological figure Phaeton due to his ambition to drive the sun chariot. This makes explicit a piece of cultural knowledge about Phaeton not stated in the source at this point.","The French 'qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes' (that they could not discover the ropes) describes the Sages' inability to see the stage mechanisms. The English 'but do not discover the Wires by which he mounts' translates 'cordes' (ropes) to the more specific 'Wires' (often used for stage flight effects) and explicitly adds their function 'by which he mounts,' clarifying how these hidden elements achieve the theatrical illusion.","The French 'comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé' (how the back of the stage was arranged) refers to the hidden stagecraft. The English 'any thing of what is done behind the Scenes' makes explicit that this involves not just the static physical arrangement ('disposé') but also the dynamic actions and operations ('what is done') occurring backstage.","The French 'une certaine Vertu secrète' (a certain secret Virtue) is offered as an explanation for Phaeton's stage flight. The English translation 'a hidden Magnetick Vertue' makes this vague 'secret Virtue' more specific by identifying it as 'Magnetick,' thereby adding a layer of (albeit whimsical) pseudo-scientific specification not present in the original.","The French 'Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas' (Phaeton has a certain friendship/affinity for the top of the theatre; he is not at ease when he is not there). The English 'Phaéton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company,' significantly expands this by changing 'amitié' to 'secret love' and explicitly detailing the anthropomorphic comparison by likening Phaeton to 'a true Lover' and the top of the theatre to his 'Mistress'.","The French impersonal pronoun 'On veut' (one wants, or it is wanted that) is rendered as 'they will have'. The pronoun 'they' makes explicit the agent of this desire, referring to the previously mentioned modern philosophers (like Descartes) who advocate for a mechanistic worldview, whereas 'On' is more general.","The French 'l'arrangement des parties' (the arrangement of the parts), referring to the components of the universe in the watch analogy, is translated as 'the just disposing of the several parts of the movement'. This expansion clarifies by adding 'just disposing' (implying precision and deliberate order) and 'of the movement,' explicitly linking these parts to the inner workings (movement) of a watch.","The French 'des choses si simples' (such simple things), on which the order of Nature is said to depend, is rendered in the Marquise's speech as the Nature's order being 'the more plain and easie it is'. This makes explicit the perceived quality of this simplicity, interpreting 'simples' as 'plain and easie' to understand or operate."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P005: Je ne sais pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en vérité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir.

It makes explicit a particular kind and intensity of 'dishonor' by providing a concrete, evaluative comparison not literally present in the more general French term, thus re-writing the author's more neutral statement into a more vivid one.","The concise French phrase \"où nous sommes\" (literally \"where we are,\" referring to humans being on Earth) is rendered with the explicit parenthetical addition \"(where we reside)\". This expansion clarifies the implied meaning of \"sommes\" in this context by specifically stating that Earth is a place of human habitation or dwelling, making the relationship more formal and concrete than the original's simple statement of presence.","The French source uses the direct description \"cette grande voûte\" (this great vault) to refer to the sky. The English translation renders this as \"this great Vault\" but adds the parenthetical comment \"(as I may call it)\". This phrase is an explicit addition by the translator, signalling to the reader that the term \"Vault\" is a figurative or consciously chosen descriptor for the sky, a meta-linguistic clarification about the terminology that is not present in Fontenelle's original, more direct statement."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie. La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus intéressée que je ne l'ai, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">à me parler Caldéen.</span></span> Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus.</span></span> Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">&amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide.</span></span> Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">&amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit.</span></span> Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces.</span></span> Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué</span></span>, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation.</span></span> Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">à la priere de Gens tres-considerables.</span></span> Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire. Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles</span></span>, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, 'tis not a true Shepherds life to talk of the Stars and Planets: See if they pass their time so in Astrea. That sort of Shepherds Craft, reply'd she, is too dangerous for me to learn: I love the honest Caldaeans, and you must teach me their Rules, if you would have me improve in their Science. But let us proceed, When they had rank'd the Heavens in that manner you tell me, pray, what is the next Question? The next, said I, is the disposing the several parts of the Universe, which the Learned call making a Systeme; but before I expound the first Systeme, I would have you observe, we are all naturally like that Mad man at Athens, who fancy'd all the Ships were his that came into the Port Pyroeum: Nor is our Folly less extravagant, we believe all things in Nature design'd for our use; and do but ask a Philosopher, to what purpose there is that prodigious company of fix'd Stars, when a far less number would perform the service they do us? He answers coldly, they were made to please our Sight. Upon this Principle they imagin'd the Earth rested in the Centre of the Universe, while all the Celestial Bodies (which were made for it) took the Page 15 pains to turn round to give light to it. They plac'd the Moon above the Earth, Mercury above the Moon, after Venus the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, above all these they set the Heaven of fix'd Stars, the Earth was just in the middle of those Circles which contain the Planets, and the greater the Circles were, they were the farther distant from the Earth, and by consequence the farthest Planets took up the most time in finishing their course, which in effect is true: But why, said the Countess, interrupting me, do you dislike this Systeme? It seems to me very Clear and Intelligible. However, Madam, said I, I will make it plainer; for should I give it you as it came from Ptolomy its Author, or from some who have since study'd it, I should fright you, I fancy, instead of diverting you. Since the Motions of the Planets are not so regular, but that sometimes they go faster, sometimes slower, sometimes are nearer the Earth, and sometimes farther from it; the Ancients did invent I do not know how many Orbs or Circles involv'd one within another, which they thought would salve all Objections; this confusion of Circles was so great, that at that time when they knew no better, a certain King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but not much troubled with Religion, said, That had God consulted him when he made the World, he would have told him how to have fram'd it better. The fancy was very Atheistical, and no doubt the Instructions he would have given the Almighty, was the suppressing those Circles with which they had clog'd the Celestial Motions, and the taking away two or three superfluous Heavens which they had placed above the fixed Stars; for these Philosophers to explain the Motion of the Celestial Bodies, had above the uppermost Heaven (which we see,) found another of Crystal, to influence and give Motion to the inferiour Heavens; and wherever they heard of another Motion, they presently clapp'd up a Crystal Heaven which cost 'em Page 17 nothing. But why must their Heaven be of Crystal, said the Countess, would nothing else serve as well? No, no, I reply'd, nothing so well; for the Light was to come thro' them, and yet they were to be solid. Aristotle would have it so, he had found Solidity to be one of their Excellencies, and when he had once said it, no body would be so rude as to question it. But it seems there were Comets much higher than the Philosophers expected, which as they pass'd along brake the Crystal Heavens, and confounded the Universe. But to make the best of a bad Market, they presently melt down their broken Glass, and to Aristotles Confusion, made the heavens fluid; and by the observations of these latter Ages it is now out of doubt, that Venus and Mercury turn round the Sun, and not round the Earth, according to the Antient Systeme, which is now every where exploded, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush</span></span>. But that which I am going to lay down, will salve all, and is so clear, that the King of Arragon himself may spare his Advice. Methinks, saith the Countess, your Philosophy is a kind of Out-cry, where he that offers to do the work cheapest, carries it from all the rest. 'Tis very true, said I, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">Nature is a great Huswife, she always makes use of what costs least</span></span>, let the difference be never so inconsiderable; and yet this frugality is accompany'd with an extraordinary magnificence, which shines thro' all her works; that is, she is magnificent in the design, but frugal in the Execution; and what can be more praise worthy, than a great design accomplish'd with a little Expence? But in our Ideas we turn things topsy-turvy, we place our thrift in the design, and are at ten times more charge in Workmanship than it requires, which is very ridiculous: Imitate Nature then, saith she, in your Systeme, and give me as little trouble as you can to comprehend you. Fear it not, Madam, said I, we have done with our impertinencies: Imagine then a German all'd Copernicus confounding every thing, earing in pieces the beloved Circles of Antiquity, and shattering their Crystal Heavens like so many Glass Windows, seiz'd with the noble Rage of Astronomy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">he snatcheth up the Earth from the Centre of the Universe, sends her packing,</span></span> and placeth the Sun in the Centre to which it did more justly belong, the Planets no longer turn round the Earth, and do not inclose it in the Circles they describe; if they give us light, it is but by chance, and as they meet us in their way. All now turns round the Sun, the Earth her self goes round the Sun, and Copernicus to punish the Earth for her former Lazyness, makes her contribute all he can to the motion of the Planets and Heavens, and now stripp'd of all the heavenly Equipage with which she was so gloriously attended, she hath nothing left her but the Moon, which still turns round about her: Fair and softly, saith the Countess, I fancy you your self are seiz'd with the Noble Fury of Astronomy; a little less Rapture, and I shall understand you the better. The Sun You say is in the Centre of the Universe, and is immovable; what follows next? It is Mercury, said I, he turns round the Sun, so that the Sun is the Centre of the Circle wherein Mercury moves; above Mercury is Venus, who turns also round the Sun; after comes the Earth, which being placed higher than Mercury and Venus, makes a greater circle round the Sun than either of them; at last come Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, in the same order I name 'em, so that Saturn hath the greatest circle round the Sun, which is the reason he is a longer time in making his Revolution than any of the other Planets. And the Moon, you have forgot her, said she: We shall quickly find her again, said I; the Moon turns round the Earth, and doth not leave her, but as the Earth advanceth in the Circle, which she describes about the Sun, and if the Moon turns round the Sun, it is because she will not quit the Earth; I understand you, said she, and I love the Moon for staying with us when all the other Planets do abandon us; nay, I fear your German would have willingly taken her away too if he could, for in all his proceedings, I find he had a great spight to the Earth. 'Twas well done of him, said I, to abate the Vanity of Mankind, who had taken up the best place in the Universe, and it pleaseth me to see the Earth in the croud of the Planets. Sure, said she, you do not think their Vanity extends it self as far as Astronomy! Do you believe you have humbled me, in telling me the Earth goes round the Sun? For my part I do not think my self at all the worse for't. I confess, said I, Madam, I believe a Fair Lady would be much more concern'd for her place at a Ball, than for her rank in the Universe; and the Precedence of two Planets will not make half such a noise in the World, as that of two Ambassadours; however the same inclination which reigns at a Ceremony, governs in a Systeme, and if you love the uppermost place in the one, the Philosopher desires the Centre in the other; he flatters himself that all things were made for him, and insensibly believes a matter of pure speculation to be a point of Interest. This is a Calumny, said she, you have invented against Mankind; why did they receive this Systeme if it was so abasing? I know not, said I, but I am sure Copernicus himself distrusted the success of his Opinion, he was a long time before he would venture to publish it, nor had he done it then without the importunity of his Friends. But do you know what became of him? the very day they brought him the first Proof of his Book, he dy'd; he foresaw he should never be able to clear all the contradictions, and very wisely slipt out of the way. I would be just to all the World, said the Countess; but 'tis hard to fancy we move and yet see we do not change our place; we find our selves in the Morning where we lay down at Night: Perhaps you will tell me the whole Earth moves-Yes certainly, said I, it is the same case as if you fell asleep in a Boat upon the River, when you awake you find your self in the same place, and the same situation in respect of all the parts of the Boat. 'Tis true, she reply'd, but here's a great difference when I awake I find another shoar, and that shows me, my Boat hath chang'd place. But 'tis not the same with the Earth, I find all things as I left 'em. No, no, said I, there is another Shoar too; You know that beyond the circles of the Planets are fix'd Stars, there is our Shoar. I am upon the Earth, and the Earh makes a great circle round the Sun, I look for the centre of the circle and see the Sun there, I then direct my sight beyond the Sun in a right Line, and should certainly discover the fix'd Stars which answer to the Sun, but that the light of the Sun effaceth 'em: But at Night I easily perceive the Stars which corresponded with him in the day, which is exactly the same thing; if the Earth did not change its place in the Circle where it is, I should see the Sun always against the same fix'd Stars, but when the Earth doth change its place, the Sun must answer to other Stars and there again is your Shoar, which is always changing. And seeing the Earth makes her circle in a year, I see the Sun likewise in the space of a year answer successively to the whole Circle of the fix'd Stars, which Circle is call'd the Zodiack: I will draw you the Figure of it, if you please, on the Sand? 'Tis no matter, said she, I can do well enough without it; beside, it will give an Air of Learning to my Park which I would not have in it: For I have heard of a certain Philosopher, who being Shipwrack'd, and cast upon an unknown Island, seeing several Mathematical Figures trac'd on the Sea-shore, cry'd out to those that follow'd him, Courage, Courage, my Companions, the Isle is inhabited, behold the Footsteps of Men; But you may spare your Figures, such Footsteps are not decent here.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy.

The English translation makes this explicit by adding the purpose and method: 'and you must teach me their Rules, if you would have me improve in their Science,' thus spelling out the implied meaning of learning about their astronomical system.","The French 'La pensée est trop libertine' (The thought is too libertine/freethinking) is rendered as 'The fancy was very Atheistical,' making the nature of the impiety more explicit and specific. The English translation also preempts the following sentence by immediately detailing the 'Instructions he would have given the Almighty,' explicitly linking the 'atheistical fancy' to specific criticisms of the Ptolemaic system that Fontenelle details subsequently.","The French '& il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide' (and it was necessary to resolve to make the heavens of a fluid matter) is expanded significantly. The English adds the idiomatic phrase 'But to make the best of a bad Market,' the vivid image 'they presently melt down their broken Glass,' and the explicit consequence 'and to Aristotles Confusion,' providing an explicit interpretation of the philosophers' reaction and its impact on Aristotelian authority.","The French 'l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit' (the ancient system is absolutely unsustainable on this point) is expanded. The English adds 'and not round the Earth' for clarification, 'which is now every where exploded' to explicitly state the system's discredited status, and 'and all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush.' This last phrase explicitly articulates the Enlightenment rejection of dogmatic authority, which was an underlying implication in the French.","The French describes Copernicus's actions ('fait main basse sur', 'détruit... met en pièces'). The English translation adds 'confounding every thing,' explicitly broadening the impact. It also elaborates by terming them 'the beloved Circles of Antiquity,' adding an explicit emotional dimension, and uses the vivid simile 'shattering their Crystal Heavens like so many Glass Windows,' making the destructive imagery more explicit and concrete.","The French 'du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué' (of the long rest she had attributed to herself) is translated as 'for her former Lazyness.' 'Lazyness' explicitly attributes a negative character trait to the Earth as the reason for her 'punishment,' a more direct and colloquial personification than the neutral 'long repos'.","The French 'son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation' (his heart does not fail to be interested in a matter of pure speculation) is translated to 'insensibly believes a matter of pure speculation to be a point of Interest.' The English explicitly frames this interest as a belief that speculation is a 'point of Interest' (implying self-interest), making the philosopher's subconscious motivation more direct.","The French 'à la priere de Gens tres-considerables' (at the request of very considerable people) becomes 'without the importunity of his Friends.' 'Importunity' explicitly suggests persistent requests, and 'his Friends' makes the relationship specific, which was more general in the French.","The French 'S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles' (If it [the Sun] did not erase the Stars) implies the Sun's role. The English 'but that the light of the Sun effaceth 'em' explicitly states that 'the light of the Sun' causes the effacement, clarifying the agent which was only implicit in the French pronoun.","The French Marquise states 'qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy' (that one must not see them here). The English 'such Footsteps are not decent here' uses 'decent' to explicitly frame her objection in terms of social propriety for her park, a specific interpretation of why the figures should not be seen there."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs.

Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, on ne l'a guere ménagée, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité.. Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures. </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">un gros Navire</span></span> monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises</span></span>? Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes. Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fût cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matière céleste, &amp; ne pas s'y laisser emporter? C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere. </p><p>P011: Mais, répliqua-t-elle encore, comment la Terre avec tout son poids se soûtient- elle sur votre matiere celeste qui doit être bien legere, puisqu'elle est si fluide? Ce n'est pas à dire, répondis-je, que ce qui est fluide, soit plus leger. Que dites-vous de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">notre gros Vaisseau</span></span>, qui avec tout son poids est plus léger que l'eau, puisqu'il y surnage? Je ne veux plus vous dire rien, dit-elle comme en colere, tant que vous aurez le gros Vaisseau. Mais m'assurez-vous bien qu'il n'y ait rien à craindre sur une pirouette aussi legere que vous me faites la Terre? Eh bien, luy répondis-je, faisons porter la Terre par quatre Elephans, comme font les Indiens. Voicy bien un autre Système, s'écria-t-elle. Du moins j'aime ces Gens-là d'avoir pourveu à leur seureté, &amp; fait de bons fondemens, au lieu que nous autres Coperniciens, nous sommes assez inconsideres pour vouloir bien nager à l'aventure dans cette matiere celeste. Je gage que si les Indiens savoient que la Terre fût le moins du monde <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">en peril de se mouvoir</span></span>, ils doubleroient les Elephans. </p><p>P012: Cela le meriteroit bien, repris-je, en riant de sa pensée, il ne faut point s'épargner les Elephans <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">pour dormir en assurance</span></span>, &amp; si vous en avez besoin pour cette nuit, nous en mettrons dans notre systême autant qu'il vous plaira; ensuite nous les retrancherons peu à peu, à mesure que vous vous rassurerez. Serieusement, reprit-elle, je ne crois pas dés à present qu'ils me soient fort necessaires, &amp; je me sens assez de courage pour oser tourner. Vous irez bien-tost encore plus loin, répliquai-je, vous tournerez avec plaisir, &amp; vous vous ferez sur ce Systême des idées réjouissantes. Quelquefois, par exemple, je me figure que je suis suspendu en l'air, &amp; que j'y demeure sans mouvement pendant que la Terre tourne sous moy en vingt-quatre heures, &amp; que je vois passer sous mes yeux tous ces visages differens, les uns blancs, les autres noirs, les autres bazannez, les autres olivâtres, que je voy d'abord des Chapeaux, &amp; puis des Turbans, &amp; puis des têtes cheveluës, &amp; puis des Têtes rases; tantôt des Villes à clochers, tantôt des Villes à longues aiguilles qui ont des Croissants, tantôt des Villes à Tours de Porcelaine, tantôt de grands Païs qui n'ont que des Cabanes; icy, des vastes Mers; là des Deserts épouvantables; enfin toute cette variété infinie qui est sur la surface de la Terre. </p><p>P013: En verité, dit-elle, tout cela mériteroit bien que l'on donnât vingt-quatre heures de son temps à le voir. Ainsi donc dans le même lieu où nous sommes à present, je ne dis pas dans ce Parc, mais dans ce même lieu, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">à le prendre dans l'air</span></span>, il y passe continuellement d'autres Peuples qui prennent notre place, &amp; au bout de vingt-quatre heures nous y revenons.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P007: I confess, said I, Madam, the footsteps of Lovers would better become this Place; that is, your Name and Cypher grav'd on the Trees by your Adorers. Tell not me, said she, of Lovers and Adorers, I am for my beloved Sun and Planets. But how comes it to pass that the Sun as to the fixed Stars compleats his course but in a year, and yet goes over our Heads every day? Did you never, I reply'd, observe a Bowl on a Bowling-green? It runs towards the Block, and at the same time turns very often round it self, so that the Parts which were above are below, and those which were below are above; just so it is with the Earth, at the same time that she advanceth on the Circle which in a years space she makes round the Sun, in twenty four hours she turns round her self; so that in twenty four hours every part of the Earth loseth the Sun, and recovers him again, and as it turns towards the Sun, it seems to rise, and as it turns from him, it seems to fall. It is very pleasant, said she, that the Earth must take all upon her self, and the Sun do nothing. And when the Moon, the other Planets, and the fix'd Stars seem to go over our Heads every twenty four hours, you'll say that too is only Fancy? Pure Fancy, said I, which proceeds from the same cause, for the Planets compleat their courses round the Sun at unequal times, according to their unequal distances, and that which we see to day answer to a certain Point in the Zodiack or Circle of the fix'd Stars, to morrow we see answer to another Point, because it is advanced on its own Circle as well as we are advanced upon ours. We move, and the Planets move too, which must make a great alteration; so that what seems irregular in the Planets, proceeds only from our motion, when in truth they are all very regular: I will suppose 'em so, said the Countess, but I would not have their Regularity put the Earth to so great trouble; methinks you exact too much Activity from so ponderous a Mass. But, said I, had you rather that the Sun and all the Stars, which are vast great Bodies, should in twenty four hours travel such an infinity of Miles, and make so prodigious a Tour as they needs must, if the Earth did not turn round it self every twenty four hours? Oh, said she, the Sun and the Stars are all Fire, their Motion is not very difficult; but the Earth, I fancy, is a little unweildy: That signifies nothing, I reply'd, for what do you think of a first rate Ship, which carries near an hundred Guns, and a thousand Men, beside her Provisions and other Furniture? you see one puff of Wind makes it sail on the Water, because the Water is liquid, and being easily separated doth very little resist the motion of the Ship: So the Earth tho' never so Massive is as easily born up by the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water, and fills all that great Space where the Planets float; for where would you the Earth should be fastned to resist the motion of the Celestial Matter, and not be driven by it? You may as well fancy a little block of Wood can withstand the current of a River. But pray, said she, how can the Earth with all its weight be born up by your Celestial Matter, which must be very light, because it is so fluid? It doth not argue, said I, that what is most fluid is most light: for what think you of the great Vessel I mention'd but now, which with all its Burthen is yet lighter than the Water it floats on? I will have nothing to do with that great Vessel, said she, and I begin to apprehend my self in some danger on such a whirlegigg as you have made of the Earth: There is no danger, I reply'd; but Madam, if you are afraid, we will have the Earth supported by four Elephants, as the Indians believe it. Hey day, cry'd she, here's another Systeme; however I love those People for taking care of themselves, they have a good Foundation to trust to, while you Copernicans are a little too venturous with the Celestial Matter; and yet I fancy if the Indians thought the Earth in the least danger of sinking, they would double their number of Elephants. They do well, said I, laughing at her fancy, who would sleep in Fear? and if you have occasion for 'em to night, we will put as many as you please in our Systeme, we can take 'em away again by degrees as you grow better confirm'd. I do not think 'em very necessary, said she, I have courage enough to turn. You shall turn with pleasure, Madam, said I, and shall find delightful Ideas in this Systeme. For Example, sometimes I fancy my self suspended in the Air, without any motion, while the Earth turns round me in twenty four hours; I see I know not how many different Faces pass under me, some white, some black, and some tauny; sometimes I see Hats, and sometimes Turbants, now Heads with Hair, and then shav'd Heads; here I see Cities with Steeples, others with Spires and Crescents, others with Towers of Purcelain, and anon great Countreys with nothing but Cottages; here. I see vast Oceans, and there most horrible Desarts; in short, I discover the infinite variety which is upon the surface of the Earth. I confess, said she, twenty four hours would thus be very well bestow'd, so that in the same Place where we are now, I do not mean in the Park, but we will suppose our selves in the Air, other People continually pass by who take up our Place, and at the end of twenty four hours we return to it again.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P007: I confess, said I, Madam, the footsteps of Lovers would better become this Place; that is, your Name and Cypher grav'd on the Trees by your Adorers.

The English translation renders this as 'the Sun as to the fixed Stars', explicitly adding the astronomical frame of reference (the fixed stars) against which the Sun's annual motion is observed, a detail implied in the source.","The French 'sur la Terre' (on the ground/earth), referring to where a ball rolls, is a general description. The English translation 'on a Bowling-green' explicitates this by specifying a concrete and culturally familiar setting for such an activity, making the philosopher's analogy more vivid for the English reader.","The French 'vers le but' (towards the target/goal) is a general term for the destination of the rolling ball. The English translation 'towards the Block' explicitates this by using the specific term for the target in the game of bowls, which is consistent with the preceding explicitation of 'Bowling-green'.","The French 'cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard' (this puts us in different points of view with regard to them) explains why planets might seem irregular. The English translation 'which must make a great alteration' explicitates the *consequence* of these differing viewpoints, spelling out that they cause a significant change in perception of planetary movements.","The French 'un gros Navire' (a large ship) is a general description. The English translation 'a first rate Ship' explicitates this by employing a specific contemporary naval term for the largest and most heavily armed class of warships, thereby enhancing the illustration of mass and unwieldiness.","The French 'd'une très grande nombre de Marchandises' (a very large number of goods/merchandise) generally describes the ship's cargo. The English translation 'beside her Provisions and other Furniture' explicitates this by specifying types of cargo ('Provisions' for food/supplies, 'Furniture' for equipment) typically found on such a large vessel, clarifying the nature of its load.","The French 'notre gros Vaisseau' (our large ship) implicitly refers to the ship example previously discussed by the philosopher. The English translation 'the great Vessel I mention'd but now' makes this anaphoric reference explicit by adding 'I mention'd but now,' clearly linking it to the earlier part of the conversation.","The French 'en peril de se mouvoir' (in danger of moving) describes the Earth's potential danger generally. The English translation 'in the least danger of sinking' explicitates the specific *kind* of feared movement by using 'sinking', which clarifies the nature of the peril in the context of an Earth supported by elephants (i.e., failing and falling downwards).","The French 'pour dormir en assurance' (to sleep in safety/assurance) states the desired outcome of being secure. The English translation adds the rhetorical question 'who would sleep in Fear?', which serves to make explicit the underlying motivation—the aversion to fear—that is implicitly contrasted by the desire for 'assurance'.","The French 'à le prendre dans l'air' (taking it [the place] in the air / considering it as in the air) describes the perspective for the thought experiment somewhat impersonally. The English 'we will suppose our selves in the Air' explicitates this by clarifying the active, hypothetical agency ('we will suppose') and centering the perspective on the observers ('our selves'), making the setup of the mental exercise more direct."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.

The translation expands this by providing specific contrasting examples (\"perhaps a Fleet of Ships, perhaps a Makrel-Boat\"), making the potential nature and scale of the \"vessel\" more explicit and vivid.","The French text states the Iroquois \"mangeront tout vif quelque prisonnier de guerre\" (will eat some prisoner of war alive). The translation adds \"for their Breakfast,\" thereby making explicit a specific, albeit potentially sensationalized, timing or context for this act, which was not specified in the original.","The French \"le Repas\" (the meal) is a general term. The translation expands this into \"Dinners and Suppers,\" making explicit the specific types of meals, adding a level of detail not present in the source.","The French phrase \"ce qu'elles croyent qui appartient essentiellement à leurs Maris\" (what they believe essentially belongs to their husbands) is somewhat abstract. The translation \"a little they reserve for their Husbands\" makes this more concrete by quantifying the reserved portion as \"a little,\" thus explicitating the nature of what is reserved.","The French \"voler des Femmes\" (to steal women) is general. The translation \"steal Concubines\" makes explicit the intended status or role of the stolen women, clarifying information that was implied by the context but not directly stated in the source.","The French phrase \"ceux qui s'embarrassent de Politique\" (those who involve themselves/get entangled in Politics) describes people by their activity. The translation \"the Polititians\" makes this explicit by assigning them a direct noun label, thus clarifying their identity or role.","The French \"le Maris ne relâchent rien\" (the husbands release/give up nothing) implies that they keep everything for themselves. The translation makes this implication explicit by adding \"but keep all to themselves,\" spelling out the direct consequence of not parting with anything.","The French describes the down as \"un certain duvet fort leger & fort lâche\" (a certain very light and very loose/slack down). The translation \"with a Down very slack and soft:\" adds the quality \"soft,\" making explicit a characteristic typically associated with down that was implied by the original adjectives.","The French \"jusqu'à vinght lieües de hauteur\" (up to twenty leagues of height) implies an upward direction from the Earth's surface. The translation \"20 Leagues upwards,\" makes this direction explicit.","The French pronoun \"luy\" (it/him) in the phrase \"plus agitée que luy\" refers anaphorically to \"l'air\" (the air) mentioned earlier in the sentence. The translation \"much more agitated than the Air:\" makes this reference explicit by restating the noun.","The French \"Vous me présentez la Terre sous des idées bien méprisables\" (You present the Earth to me under very contemptible ideas) refers generally to the philosopher's portrayal. The translation \"Your comparison...is somewhat mean,\" explicitly links the Marquise's critical reaction to the specific silkworm analogy the philosopher had just used, clarifying the direct object of her sentiment.","The French \"qu'il règne de tous côtés une si grande agitation\" (that such great agitation reigns on all sides) describes a general state of turmoil. The translation \"what Changes\" specifies a key outcome or manifestation of this \"agitation,\" making explicit one of the significant consequences implied by widespread societal disturbance.","The French \"& se joüe de la petite boule\" (and plays with the little ball / makes sport of the little ball) is somewhat general about how Nature interacts with the Earth. The translation \"as if she were at Bouls.\" makes this interaction more concrete and specific by likening Nature's action to playing the game of bowls, thus explicitating a particular manner of \"playing\" with the Earth.","The French \"toutes les précautions que vous prenez pour empêcher qu'on ne s'aperçoive du mouvement de la Terre\" (all the precautions you take to prevent one from noticing the Earth's movement) refers to the philosopher's arguments.

The translation to 'of Natural Philosophy' explicitly provides this historical clarification. Instead of using the direct cognate 'Physics', which for a modern reader might imply a narrower, more specialized field, the translator chose 'Natural Philosophy' to accurately reflect the wider scope of scientific inquiry (including astronomy and cosmology) that Fontenelle was popularizing. This choice aligns with the cultural context of the Scientific Revolution, where 'Natural Philosophy' was the encompassing term for the study of the natural world."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: En retournant au Château je luy dis pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes, qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Tycho Brahé qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fût immobile, la plaçoit au centre du Monde, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planètes, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planètes autour de la Terre.

In the French source, the idea that the Earth is being *uniquely* or *solely* exempted from turning around the Sun is implied by the subsequent justificatory clause \"puisqu'on n'en pouvait pas exempter tant d'autres grands corps\" (since one could not exempt so many other large bodies from it). The addition of \"only\" in the target text makes this implied uniqueness explicit within the description of the act of exempting the Earth, thereby spelling out a relationship (Earth as a sole exception) that was left unstated in the immediate preceding phrase.","The French source states that Copernicus's system \"& n'a aucun mélange de préjugé\" (and has no mixture of prejudice). This characteristic implies that the system is more rational, aligned with evidence rather than preconceived notions, and therefore more likely to be true or correct. The translator makes this implication explicit by substituting \"Probable\" for the description of being unprejudiced. \"Probable\" directly expresses an assessment of the system's likelihood of being true, a quality inferred from its freedom from prejudice mentioned in the source.

The translator makes explicit the probable identity of \"du monde\" by specifying \"some Neighbours\" (an identity implied in a rural context) and adds the specific purpose of their visit (\"to dine with her\"), which was not explicitly stated in the source's description of their arrival and extended stay.","The French \"Elle les avoit si bien conceus\" (She had understood them so well) refers to \"nos Sistêmes\" (our systems) discussed previously. The English translation \"She so well conceiv'd what I told her the night before\" explicitly links her understanding to the specific content and timing of the previous evening's conversation (\"what I told her the night before\"), a connection that was implied by the narrative flow but not directly articulated in the French clause.","The French phrase \"je me tiens toujours en état de me pouvoir ranger à leur opinion avec honneur, si elle avoit le dessus\" (I always keep myself in a position to be able to rally to their opinion with honor, if it prevailed) describes a pragmatic stance. The English translation \"I am (as some honest Gentlemen in point of Religion) still ready to embrace the prevailing Opinion\" incorporates the parenthetical addition \"(as some honest Gentlemen in point of Religion)\". This addition serves to make the nature of the narrator's pragmatism more explicit and impactful for the English reader of the late 17th century by drawing a parallel to contemporary attitudes towards religious conformity in England, an analogy not present in Fontenelle's original text but which re-writes it for cultural relevance.","The French pronoun \"ils\" (they) in the phrase \"en attendant qu'ils ayent sur nous quelque avantage considérable\" refers anaphorically to \"ceux qui ne le croyent pas\" (those who do not believe it) mentioned earlier in the paragraph.

While also a localization, 'Cockney' makes explicit a specific type of naive provincialism associated with that London stereotype, which is only generally implied by 'Bourgeois de Paris'.","The French 'qui ne sera jamais sorty de sa Ville' (who will never have left his City) is expanded to 'as he that never was out of the sound of Bow-Bell.' This makes explicit the defining characteristic of the 'Cockney' stereotype, specifying the nature of his limited experience which was more general in the source.","The French 'vous nous faites tort' (you wrong us/do us an injustice) is translated as 'You are too severe, said she, upon your Fellow-Citizens'. The addition 'upon your Fellow-Citizens' explicitly clarifies the referent of 'nous' (us), specifying that the Marquise is defending the general populace or her peers.","The French 'je vous vois un air de confiance qui me fait déjà peur' (I see in you an air of confidence that already scares me) is translated to 'you seem so confident of it, that I fear I must, whether I will or no.' The clause 'whether I will or no' explicitly spells out the Marquise's feeling of being reluctantly compelled to believe, a nuance only implied by 'me fait déjà peur'.","The French 'Il n'y a que le Soleil en qui cela soit une qualité considérable.' (It is only in the Sun that this [being luminous] is a considerable quality.) is translated as 'for 'tis the Sun which is the sole Fountain of Light; that Quality proceeds only from him'. The phrase 'sole Fountain of Light' explicitly clarifies *why* the Sun's luminosity is 'considérable' by emphasizing its unique origin, information which is less direct in the source.","The French 'elle nous la renvoye' (she sends it back to us) referring to the Moon and sunlight, is translated as 'she reflects it back on the Earth'. The verb 'reflects' makes the specific scientific process of light reflection explicit, whereas 'renvoye' is more general.","The French 'il faut que la Terre renvoye aussi à la Lune la lumière du Soleil' (the Earth must also send back to the Moon the Sun's light) is translated as 'the Earth in the same manner receives Light from the Sun, and sends it to the Moon'. The addition of 'receives Light from the Sun' explicitly spells out the necessary preceding step for the Earth to illuminate the Moon, a step only implied in the source.","The French explanation of light begins 'La lumiere est composée de petites balles...'. The English translation prefaces this with 'but you must know that Light is made up of certain little Balls...'. The introductory phrase 'but you must know that' is an addition by the translator, making the pedagogical intent explicit by framing the information as something being formally imparted.","The French 'renvoye ces petites balles' (sends back these little balls) is translated as 'from which the little Balls rebound'. The word 'rebound' explicitly describes the specific mechanical action implied by the corpuscular theory of light (little balls bouncing off a solid surface), which is more general in the French 'renvoye'.","The French 'Or je croy que vous ne contesterez pas à la Terre cette même dureté e& cette même solidité.' (Now I believe that you will not dispute this same hardness and solidity of the Earth.) is translated as 'and we must deny our Senses, if we will not allow the Earth the same Solidity;'. The English version makes explicit the *reason* why the Earth's solidity is incontrovertible (it would be a denial of sensory experience), a justification that is only implied by the milder French assumption of agreement.","The French 'l'éclat des Conditions; élevées au-dessus des nôtres' (the brilliance of conditions; elevated above ours) is translated as 'the Quality and Fortune of those who are above us'. 'Quality and Fortune' explicitly specifies the socio-economic nature of the 'Conditions' that dazzle, aspects that are more abstractly implied in the French.","The French 'qu'au fond elles se ressemblent toutes extrêmement' (that at bottom they all resemble each other extremely) is translated as 'when, do but look to the Bottom, and we are all alike.' The phrase 'we are all alike' spells out more directly and perhaps more emphatically the egalitarian implication of fundamental human similarity.","The French 'Qui serait entre la Lune & la Terre, ce seroit la vraye place pour les bien voir.' (Who would be between the Moon and the Earth, that would be the true place to see them well.) is translated as 'So that the true way to see things as they are, is to be between the Moon and the Earth'. The addition 'to see things as they are' explicitly states the epistemological benefit or purpose of this ideal vantage point, which is implied in the French.","The French 'Astre' (celestial body/star), when referring to how the Earth might appear from the Moon, is translated as 'Planet'. This makes the specific astronomical classification explicit, aiding clarity for a popular audience in the context of Copernican astronomy.","The French 'fonctions d'Astres' (functions of celestial bodies/stars) is translated as 'function of a Planet'. Similar to the instance above, this explicitates the astronomical term to 'Planet', reinforcing the specific scientific context for the reader.","The French 'sur le fondement des tâches qu'elle nous montre' (on the basis/foundation of the spots she shows us), describing the imagined face on the Moon, is rendered as 'of the Spots in her' in the phrase 'the Eyes, Mouth, and Face which we have fancy'd of the Spots in her'. The English phrasing makes the relationship more direct by implying the spots are the material *from which* the face is imagined, rather than merely the evidence for it, thus explicitating the compositional link.","The French 'd'autres tâches differemment arrangées, nous feroient sans doute imaginer quelque autre figure' (other differently arranged spots would doubtless make us imagine some other figure) is translated as 'we should no doubt fancy another Figure from the different Spots that are in it:'. The English construction 'from the different Spots' explicitly states the spots as the causal source or material for the imagined figure, whereas the French uses the spots as the agent (subject) of 'feroient imaginer' (would make imagine).","The French source states the Moon's synchronous rotation: 'Ce n'est pas que la Lune ne tourne sur elle-même, elle y tourne en autant de temps qu'autour de la Terre, c'est à dire, en un mois;'. The English translation, after rendering this fact, inserts a lengthy explanation: 'but while she is making that turn upon her self...it appears to her to be held up in the same place of the Heavens:'. This added passage explicitly details *how* synchronous rotation results in the same lunar face being presented to Earth and the relative perceptions of celestial movements by hypothetical Lunarians, information only implied or unstated in the French.","The French text mentions 'ce tremblement' (this trembling) of the Moon, referring to libration. The English translation explicitates this by adding a descriptive clause: 'which causeth a little corner of her Face to be sometimes hid from us, and a little corner of the opposite half appears'. This clause clarifies the visual manifestation and effect of the Moon's libration, details not provided in the source's brief mention."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P026: Toutes ces Planètes, dit la Marquise, sont faites comme nous, qui rejetons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mêmes.

This addition explicitly articulates the clarity or obviousness of the deduction, which is only implied by the Marquise's confident tone and reasoning in the source text.","The French phrase \"Il ne tient qu'à vous de le deviner\" (meaning \"It is up to you to guess it\" or \"You only have to guess it\") is translated as \"You may easily guess that\".

The English \"is seising on those Planets with his Talons\" makes the demon's action more explicit by using a more direct verb \"seising on\" (instead of \"spreads over\") and by restating the instrument as \"his Talons\" (after \"Claws\" were mentioned), thus emphasizing the aggressive nature and means of the attack, which was more generally implied.","The French \"une situation tres propre à obtenir\" (a very suitable situation to obtain/get) is general. The English \"a very devout Posture, to implore\" explicitates this by: 1) changing \"situation\" to the more concrete \"Posture\" and specifying its nature as \"devout,\" adding a religious characteristic to \"propre\" (suitable) that was not explicit. 2) changing the neutral \"obtenir\" (to obtain/get) to \"implore,\" specifying the method of seeking divine intervention as an earnest plea. These changes make the nature of the Indians' ritual action more specific.","The French \"belle peur\" is an idiomatic expression for \"a big fright\" or \"a good scare.\" The English \"pannick Fear\" explicitates the intensity and specific nature of this fear by characterizing it as \"panic,\" a sudden, overwhelming, and potentially irrational terror. This is a more specific psychological interpretation than the general implication of intense fear in \"belle peur.\"","The French \"les Philosophes qui écrivent pour nous rassurer\" (the Philosophers who write to reassure us) is a general reference. The English translation \"all the Philosophers of Gresham\" makes this specific by adding \"of Gresham,\" likely localizing the reference for an English audience by invoking a known British scientific institution and adding information not present in the source. Furthermore, the French \"n'écrivirent ils pas en vain?\" (didn't they write in vain?) describes a general failure.

The translation \"a general Law of Mankind\" makes this implied universality explicit by adding the adjective \"general\" to \"Law,\" thereby specifying the comprehensive nature of the proposed edict.","The French \"le même Arrêt\" (the same decree) anaphorically refers to the decree just proposed by the Marquise.

The English translation \"the Folly of Man\" (with capitalization) transforms this into a singular, abstract concept of \"Folly\" as an inherent, essential attribute of \"Man\" as a collective.

The English translation makes this referent explicit by introducing the noun phrase 'the People' within the larger phrase 'of the People in the Moon', clearly identifying the group being discussed before the subsequent pronoun 'they' is used.","The French 'se missent à l'eau' (literally 'put themselves in the water' or 'got into the water') describes a general action. The English translation 'to be up to the Neck in Water' adds the specific detail 'up to the Neck,' which is not explicitly stated in the source, thus making the description of the immersion more vivid and detailed by adding clarifying information.","The French 'Je n'en doute nullement' (I do not doubt it at all) is a firm statement of agreement. The English translation adds the phrase 'And why not,' before rendering the core meaning (which follows as 'I do not doubt it at all'). This addition makes explicit a rhetorical stance of immediate, almost challenging, affirmation or obviousness that was only implicitly suggested by the directness of the French phrase.","The French 'Messieurs de la Lune' (literally 'Gentlemen of the Moon') could carry a slightly ironic or formal tone, or be interpreted as referring primarily to males. The English 'the People of the Moon' makes it explicit that the reference is to all inhabitants generally, neutralizing potential gender or class connotations and clarifying the scope of 'Messieurs' to be more inclusive, which aligns with the work's aim to popularize science for a broad audience.","The French 'un nombre prodigieux d'hommes' (a prodigious number of men) is translated as 'a prodigious company of Men.' The word 'company' is more specific than 'nombre' (number), explicitly emphasizing the men as a collective group or assembly, rather than just a large quantity. This spells out a relationship (of being a collective) that was less pronounced in the original.","The French 'Aprés cela' (After that / Following that) indicates a general sequential or logical progression. The English 'But sure' makes the specific rhetorical function more explicit: 'sure' often signals a concession, while 'But' introduces a contrasting point.

The translator's addition clarifies this perceived simplicity or accessibility of the scientific point being made, enhancing the popularizing tone.","The French phrase \"en renvoient moins\" (reflect/send back less of it [light]), referring to how much light water reflects, is translated as \"send back but a very little\". The source text indicates a comparative reduction in reflected light.

J'avoüe qu'il eut mieux fait de n'y pas mêler Saint Jean, dont le nom est si digne de respect; mais enfin c'est une licence Poëtique, qui peut seulement passer pour un peu trop gaye. Tout le Poëme est dédié à un Cardinal, e&amp; un grand Pape l'a honoré d'une approbation éclatante que l'on voit au devant de quelques Editions. Voicy de quoy il s'agit. Roland, Neveu de Charlemagne, étoit devenu fou, parce que la belle Angelique luy avoit préferé Médor. Un jour Astolphe, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">brave Paladin</span></span>, se trouva dans le Paradis Terrestre, qui étoit sur la cime d'une Montagne très haute, où <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">son Hippogriffe</span></span> l'avoit porté. Là il rencontre Saint Jean, qui luy dit que pour guerir la folie de Rolan, il étoit necessaire qu'ils fissent ensemble le Voyage de la Lune. Astolphe, qui ne demandoit qu'à voir du Pays, ne se fait point prier, &amp; aussi-tôt voilà un Chariot de feu qui enleve par les airs l'apôtre e&amp; le Paladin. Comme Astolphe n'étoit pas grand Philosophe, il fut fort surpris de voir la Lune beaucoup plus grande qu'elle ne luy avoit paru de dessus la Terre. Il fut bien plus surpris encore de voir d'autres fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts, &amp; ce qui m'aurait bien surpris aussi, des Nymphes qui chassoient dans ces Forêts. Mais ce qu'il vit de plus rare dans la Lune, c'étoit un Vallon où se trouvoit tout ce qui se perdoit sur la Terre, de quelque espèce qu'il fût, &amp; les Couronnes, &amp; les Richesses, &amp; la Renommée, &amp; une infinité d'Esperances, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">le temps qu'on donne au Jeu</span></span>, &amp; les Aumônes qu'on fait faire aprés sa mort, &amp; les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes, &amp; les Soûpirs des Amans.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P022: I must own then, said the Countess, they are very exact; but what do they say to the inside of the Country?

Astolfo, who had a great mind to see Countrys, did not stand much upon entreaty, and immediately there came a fiery Chariot which carry'd the Apostle and the Knight up into the Air; Astolfo being no great Philosopher, was surpriz'd to find the Moon so much bigger than it appear'd to him when he was upon the Earth; to see Rivers, Seas, Mountains, Cities, Forrests, nay, what would have surpriz'd me too, Nymphs hunting in those Forrests; but that which was most remarkable, was a Valley where you might find any thing that was lost in our World, of what nature soever; Crowns, Riches, Fame, and an infinity of Hopes, the time we spend in Play, and in searching for the Philosophers Stone, the Alms we give after our Death, the Verses we present to great Men and Princes, and the Sighs of Lovers.

The translator replaces the general term with the name of John Flamsteed, a prominent English astronomer of the era (First Astronomer Royal, appointed 1675), and adds a descriptive appositive. This act of specification and addition makes an implicit general reference explicit and concrete for the English readership by localizing it with a well-known figure, thereby re-writing the text to enhance its relevance and authority within the target cultural context.","The French \"brave Paladin\" (brave Paladin) referring to Astolphe is translated as \"a Knight Errant\". While \"Paladin\" denotes a distinguished knight, particularly one of Charlemagne's peers, \"Knight Errant\" explicitly describes a knight who wanders in search of adventure. This translation explicates the active, adventurous role Astolfo plays in Ariosto's narrative, a role implied by his character type but spelled out by \"Knight Errant\". The adjective \"brave\" is omitted, with the focus shifting to explicating his functional character type, which is central to his journey to the Moon.","The French \"son Hippogriffe\" (his Hippogriff) is translated as \"his flying Horse\". A Hippogriff is a specific mythical creature, part horse, part eagle. By translating it as \"flying Horse\", the translator makes the essential characteristic and nature of this fantastical creature explicit to an audience that might be unfamiliar with the specific term \"Hippogriff\", thereby adding clarifying information about what the creature is and how it enables Astolfo's journey.","The French \"le temps qu'on donne au Jeu\" (the time one gives to Play/Games), listed as one of the things lost on Earth and found in the Moon, is expanded in the English translation to \"the time we spend in Play, and in searching for the Philosophers Stone\". The translator adds the specific example \"and in searching for the Philosophers Stone\". This is an explicitation by addition, as Fontenelle's summary of Ariosto omits this item, which is present in Ariosto's original poem (Orlando Furioso, Canto XXXIV, as time lost to alchemy). The translator re-inserts this culturally resonant example of a time-consuming pursuit, thereby re-writing Fontenelle's list to be more comprehensive in its representation of Ariosto's original inventory of lost things."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune. N'y eût-il que vous, Madame, repris-je en badinant, vous y avez fait aller tous ceux qu'on vous a adressez, &amp; c'est dequoy faire dans la Lune un amas considerable. Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin. C'est que les Papes ont prétendu être Maîtres de Rome &amp; de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, &amp; la verité est qu'on ne sauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë. Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie. Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres bien conservé. En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus. Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, &amp; qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, &amp; sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune. Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà. Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Il eut assez de peine à la porter</span></span>; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres.</span></span> Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut.

The English translator makes the specific poetic form and fuller content of these \"beaux Vers\" explicit by replacing Fontenelle's prose account with a complete, formal poetic stanza, likely sourced from an existing English translation of Ariosto's *Orlando Furioso*. This explicitation shifts the style from Fontenelle's descriptive reporting of the verses to a direct presentation of the referenced poetry itself, thereby altering Fontenelle's rhetorical strategy and the reader's experience of the allusion.","Fontenelle's Marquise suggests their philosophically lost wits are better stored in vials on the Moon, \"au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne\" (instead of our Wits perhaps wandering here on Earth attached to someone not worthy of them). The translator makes the implied cause (love) and the specific nature of this unworthiness explicit by rephrasing this as \"when 'tis forty to one, but Love fixeth our Wits on an Object we cannot but be asham'd of.\" This interpretation specifies that the \"unworthy person\" is an object of a shameful love, explicitly connecting to the dialogue's earlier contrast between wits lost to philosophy versus love. The addition of \"'tis forty to one\" also makes the probability more explicit and colloquial than Fontenelle's \"peut-être\" (perhaps)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience?

Troth, Madam, said I, I know not; for put the case that we our selves inhabited the Moon, and were not Men, but rational Creatures; could we imagin, do you think, such fantastical People upon the Earth, as Mankind is? Is it possible we should have an Idea of so strange a Composition, a Creature of such foolish Passions, and such wise Reflections? So Learned in things of no use, and so stupidly Ignorant of what most concerns him? So much concern for Liberty, and yet such great inclinations to Servitude? So desirous of Happiness, and yet so very incapable of being so? the People in the Moon must be wise indeed to suppose all this of us. But do we not see our selves continually, and cannot so much as guess how we were made? So that we are forc'd to say, the Gods when they created us were drunk with Nectar, and when they were sober again, could not chuse but laugh at their own handy-work.

The English translation makes this implied category explicit by adding 'but rational Creatures'.","The French 'quelque chose' (something), used to refer to mankind, is a vague pronoun. The English translation explicates this by substituting it with the more descriptive phrases 'so strange a Composition, a Creature of', thereby clarifying that this 'something' refers to a specific type of being with a particular makeup.","The French 'les plus importantes' (the most important things) leaves the specific nature of these 'important things' implicit. The English translation 'what most concerns him' explicitly clarifies that these are things defined by their relevance and impact on mankind ('him').","The French 'tout cela' (all that) implicitly refers to the preceding detailed description of mankind. The English translation makes this reference explicit by adding 'of us' to the phrase 'all this', directly connecting the description back to humans.","The French 'leur Ouvrage' (their Work/Creation) is a general term. The English translation 'their own handy-work' explicitly adds a qualitative nuance, suggesting a creation that is personally crafted, possibly with an element of quaintness or even caprice, fitting the context of gods amused by what they made.","The French 'd'inquietude sur les Habitans' (concern/curiosity about the Inhabitants) implies unspoken questions regarding their nature and activities. The English translation makes these implied questions explicit by adding 'What Creatures inhabit it, and what they do there?', thereby spelling out the specific components of the 'inquiétude'.","The French 'quelles Gens sont à l'autre' (what People/Folk are at the other [end]) inquires generally about the people. The English translation 'who lives' makes explicit one fundamental aspect of this inquiry by focusing on their state of being alive, thus clarifying a specific dimension of the unknown.","The French 'cet autre Vaisseau' (that other Vessel) refers to the Moon. The English translation inserts the adjective 'great' (in 'another great Vessel'), making explicit the implied significant size of the Moon as a celestial body, an attribute understandable from the astronomical context but not directly stated in the French phrase."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">du commerce</span></span> entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">ce Vaisseau</span></span> êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite</span></span>, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit</span></span>; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">terrassent</span></span> tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">le feu</span></span> en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas?</span></span> Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires</span></span> qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">Eh! de grace, consentons</span></span> qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais</span></span>, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">répliquay-je en éclatant de rire</span></span>, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier.</span></span> Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">être retenus dans nos jugements</span></span>. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites.</span></span> J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">une opinion chimerique</span></span>, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">Ah! vous me soulagez</span></span>, répliqua la Marquise, votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P028: Oh, said she, for the Earth, I reckon it all as good as discover'd, and can guess at the People, tho' I never heard a word of 'em; for certainly they all resemble us very much, and we may know 'em better when we have a mind to't; they will stay where they are, and 'tis no more but going to see 'em; but we cannot get into the Moon if we would, so that I despair of knowing what they do there. You would laugh at me, said I, if I should answer you seriously, perhaps I may deserve it, and yet, I fancy, I can say a great deal to justifie a ridiculous thought that is just now come into my Head; nay to use the Fools best Argument, I'll lay a wager I make you own (in spite of Reason) that one of these days there may be a Communication between the Earth and the Moon, and who knows what great Advantages we may procure by it? Do but consider America before it was discover'd by Columbus, how profoundly ignorant were those People, they knew nothing at all of Arts or Sciences, they went naked, had no other Arms but a Bow and Arrows, and did not conceive they might be carry'd by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a wide Space, forbidden to Man, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing: 'Tis true, after having spent whole years in making hollow the trunks of great Trees with sharp stones, they put themselves to Sea in these Trunks, and floated from Land to Land, as the Wind and Waves drove 'em; but how often was their Trough overset, and they forc'd to recover it again by swimming? So that (except when they were on the Land) it might be said they were continually swimming: And yet had any one but told 'em of another kind of Navigation incomparably more perfect and useful than their own, that they might easily pass over that infinite Space of Water, that they might stop in the middle of the Waves, and in some sense command the Winds, and make their Vessel go fast or slow as they pleas'd; in short, that this impassable Ocean should be no obstacle to their conversing with another different People; do you think they would have believed you? and yet at last that day is come; the unheard of and most surprizing Sight appears, vast great Bodies, with white Wings, are seen to fly upon the Sea, to vomit Fire from all Parts, and to cast on their Shoars an unknown People, all scaled with Iron, who dispose and govern Monsters as they please; carry Thunder in their Hands, and overthrow and destroy whoever resists 'em: From whence came they? Who brought 'em over the Sea? Who gave to 'em the Disposal of the Fire of Heaven? Are they Gods? Are they Sons of the Sun? for certainly they are not Men. Do but consider, Madam, the surprize of the Americans, there can be nothing greater; and after this, shall any one say there shall never be a Communication between the Moon and the Earth. Did the Americans believe there would ever be any between them and Europe, till it came to pass? 'Tis true, you must pass this great Space of Air and Heaven which is between the Earth and the Moon; but did not those vast Seas seem at first as impassable to the Americans? You rave, I think, said she, did you not own the Americans were so ignorant, that they had not the least conception of crossing the Sea; but we who know a great deal more then they, can imagine and fancy the going through the Air, tho' we are assur'd it is not to be done. There is somewhat more than Fancy, I reply'd, when it hath been already practis'd, for several have found the secret of fastning Wings, which bear them up in the Air, to move them as they please, and to fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple; I cannot say indeed they have yet made an Eagles Flight, or that it doth not cost now and then a Leg or an Arm to one of these new Birds; but this may serve to represent the first Planks that were launch'd on the Water, and which were the very beginning of Navigation; there were no Vessels then thought of to sail round the World, and yet you see what great Ships are grown by little and little from those first Planks. The Art of Flying is but newly invented, it will improve by degrees, and in time grow perfect; then we may fly as far as the Moon. We do not yet pretend to have discover'd all things, or that what we have discover'd can receive no addition; and therefore, pray let us agree, there are yet many things to be done in the Ages to come. Were you to live a thousand Ages, said the Countess, I can never believe you will fly, but you must endanger your Neck. I will not, I reply'd, be so unmannerly as to contradict a fair Lady, but tho' we cannot learn the Art here, I hope you will allow they may fly better in the Moon; 'tis no great matter whether we go to them, or they come to us, we shall then be the Americans, who knew nothing of Navigation, and yet there were very good Ships at t' other end of the World. Were it so, said she, the People in the Moon would have been here before now. All in good time, said I, the Europians were not in America till at the end of some thousands of years, they were so long in improving Navigation to the point of crossing the Ocean. The People in the Moon have already made some short Voyages in the Air; they are exercising continually, and by degrees will be more expert, then we shall see 'em, and God knows how we shall be surpriz'd. It is unsufferable, said she, you should banter me at this rate, and justifie your ridiculous Fancy by such false reasoning. I am going to demonstrate, said I, you reproach me very unjustly: Consider, Madam, that the World is unfolded by degrees; for the Ancients were very positive, that the Torrid and Frigid Zones were not inhabitable, by reason of their excessive Heat and Cold; and in the time of the Romans, the general Map of the World was but very little extended beyond that of their Empire; which tho' in one sense, express'd much Grandeur, in another sense, was a sign of as great Ignorance; however, there were Men found both in very hot and in very cold Countreys; so that you see the World is already encreas'd after that it was thought that the Ocean cover'd the whole Earth, except what was then discover'd; there was no talk then of the Antipodes, not so much as a thought of 'em, for who could fancy their Heels at top, and their Heads at bottom; and yet after all their fine reasoning, the Antipodes were discover'd; here's now another half of the World starts up, and a new Reformation of the Map; methinks this, Madam, should restrain us, and teach us not to be so positive in our Opinions, the World will unfold it self more to us hereafter; then we shall know the People in the Moon as well as we do now the Antipodes; but all things must be done in order, the whole Earth must be first discover'd, and till we are perfectly acquainted with our own Habitation, we shall never know that of our Neighbours. Without fooling, said the Countess, you are so very profoud in this Point, that I begin to think, you are in earnest, and believe what you say. Not so neither, said I, but I would shew you how easie it is to maintain a chymerical Notion, that may (like some opinions in Religion,) perplex a Man of understanding, but never perswade him; there is nothing perswades but Truth, it hath no need of all its proofs, but enters naturally into our Understanding; and when once we have learn'd it, we do nothing but think of it.

The English translation not only translates 'commerce' to 'Communication' but explicitly adds the speculative phrase 'and who knows what great Advantages we may procure by it?', making potential benefits, which were only implied by 'commerce', explicit.","The French 'ce Vaisseau' (this vessel), referring to a hollowed-out tree trunk, is translated as 'their Trough'. 'Vaisseau' is a general term, while 'Trough' explicitly adds a more primitive and somewhat disparaging connotation, making the rudimentary nature of the boat, implied by the description, more explicit.","The French 'une sorte de Navigation incomparably plus parfaite' (a kind of navigation incomparably more perfect) is expanded to 'another kind of Navigation incomparably more perfect and useful than their own.' The additions 'and useful' and 'than their own' explicitly state a quality (usefulness) implied by 'perfect' and clarify the implicit comparison to the Americans' current methods.","The French 'qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit' (that one was master of the speed with which one went) is made more concrete by the English 'and make their Vessel go fast or slow as they pleas'd.' The target text explicitly details the practical meaning of being 'master of the speed' (controlling acceleration and deceleration), which was only implied.","The French verb 'terrassent' (strike down, lay low) is translated using the doublet 'overthrow and destroy.' This expansion makes the violent and complete nature of the defeat more explicit and vivid than the single French verb.","The French 'le feu' (the fire), referring to the fire from cannons and firearms, is translated as 'the Fire of Heaven.' This addition explicitly attributes a supernatural or divine quality to the Europeans' weaponry from the perspective of the indigenous people, a connotation only implicitly suggested by their awe.","The French question 'Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique & l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas?' uses a past conditional to imply the unlikelihood of foreseeing contact. The English translation adds 'till it came to pass?', which explicitly introduces the known historical outcome, thereby making the retrospective irony more direct.","The French 'De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires' (From those planks, it was a long way to large ships) implies a long developmental path. The English 'there were no Vessels then thought of' explicitly shifts this to a lack of contemporary conception, making the cognitive or imaginative gap of the time explicit.","The French 'Eh! de grace, consentons' (Ah! please, let's agree) is an exhortation. The English translation 'and therefore, pray let us agree' prefaces this with 'and therefore,' explicitly marking the statement as a logical conclusion derived from the preceding discussion about progress, a connection that was implicit in the original.","The Marquise's French statement 'Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais' expresses strong disbelief in the possibility of flight. The English translation prefaces this with 'Were you to live a thousand Ages,' a hyperbolic phrase not in the source, which explicitly amplifies the perceived permanence and intensity of her skepticism.","The French 'répliquay-je en éclatant de rire' (I replied, bursting out laughing) describes the philosopher's manner. The English translation 'All in good time, said I' converts this description of laughter into an explicitly spoken phrase that conveys a patient and slightly teasing attitude, making the underlying sentiment of the laughter explicit in the dialogue.","The French 'Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier' (If you anger me, I replied, I know well what I will add to strengthen it) is a somewhat playful challenge. The English 'I am going to demonstrate, said I, you reproach me very unjustly:' makes explicit the philosopher's new rhetorical aim ('to demonstrate') and his interpretation of the Marquise's reaction ('you reproach me unjustly'), aspects not directly stated in the French.","The French 'être retenus dans nos jugements' (to be restrained/reserved in our judgments) is rendered as 'not to be so positive in our Opinions.' The target phrase explicitly clarifies the nature of this restraint as avoiding overconfidence or dogmatism, which is a more specific interpretation of the general 'retenus.'","The French 'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites.' (it is not possible that you do not truly believe what you say) conveys a strong conviction. The English 'I begin to think, you are in earnest, and believe what you say.' makes the Marquise's (Countess's) cognitive process explicit by adding 'I begin to think,' showing her gradual arrival at this conclusion.","The French 'une opinion chimerique' (a chimerical opinion) is general. The English translation 'a chymerical Notion, that may (like some opinions in Religion,)' adds the parenthetical comparison '(like some opinions in Religion,).' This explicitly provides a contemporary, culturally relevant example (religious dogma vs. reason) to illustrate a 'chimerical notion,' which Fontenelle left unspecified.","The French 'Ah! vous me soulagez' (Ah! you relieve me) expresses the Marquise's relief. The English translation 'I think you then, said she, for imposing on me no longer' (even if 'think' is unusual, possibly for 'thank') adds 'for imposing on me no longer.' This phrase explicitly states the reason for her relief – the cessation of the philosopher's perplexing arguments – a cause which was implied but not directly articulated as the source of her relief."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.

The English translation `next day` makes explicit the temporal relation to their previous evening conversation, specifying that the Marquise wished to continue on the *following* day. This clarifies the timeline which is implied by the context of sequential conversations.","The French `voulut megager` (understood as \"wanted to engage me\") simply states the Marquise's desire. The English translation transforms this by adding a preceding clause, `was so intent upon her Notions, that she would fain have engag'd me`. The phrase `so intent upon her Notions` explicitly provides the psychological motivation or intense focus driving her desire, information that was only implied in the French by her wish to continue the specific discussions.","The French `poursuivre nos Entretiens` (\"to continue our Conversations\") expresses the general idea of continuing. The English translation `to go on where I left off` makes explicit the specific manner of continuation, clarifying that the discussion should resume precisely from the point at which it was previously halted. This adds a procedural detail not explicit in the source.","The French `elles en étoient l'objet` (\"they were the subject of them/it\") uses pronouns: `elles` (they) referring to \"the Moon and Stars\" mentioned earlier, and `en` (of them/it) referring to \"nos chimeres\" (our chimeras/fantasies) or the general topic of conversation. The English translation `the Moon and Stars were become the Subject of our Discourse` makes these referents explicit by naming `the Moon and Stars` directly instead of using a pronoun, and by specifying `our Discourse` as what they were the subject of, thus clarifying relationships that were pronominally indicated and more generally implied in the source.","The French phrase `Nous ne manquâmes pas à aller` (\"We did not fail to go\" or \"We made sure to go\") indicates that the action of going took place as expected or habitually. The English translation `we went again` makes explicit the repetitive nature of the visit to the park, clarifying that this was a subsequent visit for this purpose, an idea strongly implied by the context of ongoing conversations and the French idiom suggesting fulfillment of a routine.","The French `qui devenoit un lieu consacré` (\"which was becoming a consecrated place\") uses the imperfect tense `devenoit` to describe an ongoing process of transformation in the past. The English translation `which was now dedicated` adds the word `now`, which makes explicit the idea that the park had reached this state of being \"dedicated\" at that particular point in the narrative, shifting emphasis from the process to its current (in-narrative) resultant state."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences êtoit habitée, pourroit bien ne l'être point; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril.

Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">Paris</span></span>. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">nüages suspendus</span></span> voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre.

On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voilà le malheur. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">A ce compte-là</span></span>, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">C'est donc un Corps</span></span> infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur.

De la distance où nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune?

Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas</span></span>, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier</span></span>, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent</span></span>, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.

I cannot suffer it, said she; yesterday you were preparing me to receive a Visit from 'em, and now there are no such People in Nature: Once you would have me believe the Moon was inhabited; I surmounted the Difficulty I had, and will now believe it. You are a little too nimble, I reply'd; did I not advise you never to be entirely convinc'd in things of this nature, but to reserve half of your understanding free and disengag'd, that you may admit of the contrary opinion, if there be any occasion. I care not for your Sentences, said she, let us come to matter of Fact. Are we not to consider the Moon as Greenwhich? No, said I, the Moon doth not so much resemble the Earth, as Greenwich doth London: The Sun draws from the Earth and Water, Exhalations and Vapours, which mounting to a certain height in the Air, do there assemble, and form the Clouds; these uncertain Clouds are driven irregularly round the Globe, sometimes shadowing one Countrey, and sometimes another; he then who beholds the Earth from a-far off, will see frequent alterations upon its surface, because a great Country overcast with Clouds, will appear dark or light, as the Clouds stay, or pass over it; he will see the Spots on the Earth often change their Place, and appear, or disappear as the Clouds remove; but we see none of these changes wrought upon the Moon, which would certainly be the same, were there but Clouds about her; but on the contrary, all her Spots are fix'd and certain, and her light parts continue where they were at first, which truly is a great misfortune; for by this reason, the Sun draws no Exhalations or Vapours above the Moon; so that it appears she is a Body infinitely more hard, and solid than the Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upwards as soon as Heat puts them in Motion: But it must be a heap of Rock and Marble, where there is no Evaporation; besides, Exhalations are so natural and necessary where there is Water, that there can be no Water at all, where there is no Exhalation; and what sort of Inhabitants must those be, whose Countrey affords no Water, is all Rock, and produceth nothing? Very fine, said she, you have forgot since, you assur'd me, we might from hence distinguish Seas in the Moon; nay, You or your Friends were Godfathers to some of 'em. Pray, what is become of your Caspian Sea, and your Black Lake? All Conjecture, Madam, I reply'd, tho' for your Ladyships sake, I am very sorry for it; for those dark places we took to be Seas, may perhaps be nothing but large Cavities; 'tis hard to guess aright at so great a distance. But will this suffice then, said she, to extirpate the People in the Moon? Not altogether, I reply'd, we will neither determine for, nor against them. I must own my weakness (if it be one) said she, I cannot be so perfectly undetermin'd as you would have me to be, but must believe one way, or the other; therefore pray fix me quickly in my opinion; as to the Inhabitants of the Moon; preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit; and yet methinks I have a strange inclination for 'em, and would not have 'em destroy'd, if it were possible to save 'em. You know, Madam, said I, I can deny you nothing; the Moon shall be no longer a Defart, but to do you service, we will repeople her. Since to all appearance, the Spots in the Moon do not change, I cannot conceive there are any Clouds about her, that sometimes obscure one part, and sometimes another; yet this doth not hinder, but that the Moon sends forth Exhalations, and Vapours. Our Clouds which we see in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their coming out of the Earth, were separated into such minute Particles, that they could not be discern'd; but as they ascend higher, they are condens'd by the Cold, and by the re- union of their Parts, are render'd visible; after which they become great Clouds, which fluctuate in the Air, till they return back again in Rain; however these Exhalations and Vapours do sometimes keep themselves so dispers'd, that they are imperceptible; or if they do assemble, it is in forming such subtile Dews, that they cannot be discern'd to fall from any Cloud. It may likewise happen, that the Vapours which go out of the Moon (for it is incredible that the Moon is such a Mass, that all its Parts are of an equal Solidity, all at rest one with another, and all incapable of any alteration from the efficacy of the Sun; I am sure we are yet unacquainted with such a Body: Marble it self is of another Nature, and even that which is most Solid, is subject to Change and Alteration; either from the secret and invisible motion it hath within it self, or from that which it receives from without) it may so happen then, that the Vapours which issue from the Moon, may not assemble round her in Clouds, and may not fall back again in Rain, but only in Dews. It is sufficient for this, that the Air with which the Moon is environ'd, (for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth) be a little different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon a little different from those of the Earth, which is very probable. Hereupon the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than on the Earth, the Effects must be different; tho' it is of no great consequence whether they are or no; for from the moment we have found an inward motion in the parts of the Moon, or produced by foreign Causes, here is enough for the new birth of its Inhabitants, and a sufficient and necessary fund for their Subsistence. This will furnish us with Corn, Fruit, Water, according to the custom or manner of the Moon, which I do not pretend to know; and all proportion'd to the wants and use of the Inhabitants, with whom I pretend to be as little acquainted. That is to say, reply'd the Countess, you know all is very well, without knowing how it is so, which is a great deal of Ignorance upon a very little Knowledge; however I comfort my self, that you have given the Moon her Inhabitants again, and have wrap'd her in an Air of her own, without which a Planet would seem but very naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: Well, Madam, said I, I have great News for you; that which I told you last Night, of the Moon's being inhabited, may not be so now: There is a new Fancy got into my Head, which puts those People in great Danger.

I must own <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">my weakness (if it be one)</span></span> said she, I cannot be so perfectly undetermin'd as you would have me to be, but must believe one way, or the other; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">therefore pray fix me quickly in my opinion; as to the Inhabitants of the Moon</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">and yet methinks I have a strange inclination for 'em, and would not have 'em destroy'd, if it were possible to save 'em.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">You know, Madam, said I, I can deny you nothing; the Moon shall be no longer a Defart, but to do you service, we will repeople her.</span></span> Since to all appearance, the Spots in the Moon do not change, I cannot conceive there are any Clouds about her, that sometimes obscure one part, and sometimes another; yet this doth not hinder, but that the Moon sends forth Exhalations, and Vapours. Our Clouds which we see in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their coming out of the Earth, were separated into such minute Particles, that they could not be discern'd; but as they ascend higher, they are condens'd by the Cold, and by the re- union of their Parts, are render'd visible; after which they become great Clouds, which fluctuate in the Air, till they return back again in Rain; however these Exhalations and Vapours do sometimes keep themselves so dispers'd, that they are imperceptible; or if they do assemble, it is in forming such subtile Dews, that they cannot be discern'd to fall from any Cloud. It may likewise happen, that the Vapours which go out of the Moon (for it is incredible that the Moon is such a Mass, that all its Parts are of an equal Solidity, all at rest one with another, and all incapable of any alteration from the efficacy of the Sun; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">I am sure we are yet unacquainted with such a Body</span></span>: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">Marble it self is of another Nature</span></span>, and even that which is most Solid, is subject to Change and Alteration; either from the secret and invisible motion it hath within it self, or from that which it receives from without) it may so happen then, that the Vapours which issue from the Moon, may not assemble round her in Clouds, and may not fall back again in Rain, but only in Dews. It is sufficient for this, that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">the Air with which the Moon is environ'd, (for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth)</span></span> be a little different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon a little different from those of the Earth, which is very probable. Hereupon the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than on the Earth, the Effects must be different; tho' it is of no great consequence whether they are or no; for from the moment we have found an inward motion in the parts of the Moon, or produced by foreign Causes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">here is enough for the new birth of its Inhabitants</span></span>, and a sufficient and necessary fund for their Subsistence. This will furnish us with Corn, Fruit, Water, according to the custom or manner of the Moon, which I do not pretend to know; and all proportion'd to the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"20\">wants and use</span></span> of the Inhabitants, with whom I pretend to be as little acquainted. That is to say, reply'd the Countess, you know all is very well, without knowing how it is so, which is a great deal of Ignorance upon a very little Knowledge; however I comfort my self, that you have given the Moon her Inhabitants again, and have wrap'd her in an Air of her own, without which a Planet would seem but very naked.</p>","explanations":["The French text uses 'Saint-Denis' (a town near Paris) in an analogy. The English translation substitutes 'Greenwhich' (a location near London) to make the geographical and analogical relationship immediately clear and culturally relevant for the English-speaking audience, thus making the basis of the comparison explicit.","Complementing the change of 'Saint-Denis' to 'Greenwich,' the translation changes 'Paris' to 'London.' This substitution makes the other part of the geographical analogy explicit and culturally familiar for English readers, ensuring they understand the intended comparison (Moon to Earth like Greenwich to London).","The French 'venir icy au premier jour' (to come here very soon/one day) is general. The English translation 'to receive a Visit from 'em' makes explicit the implied social nature of their potential arrival, framing it as a formal social call ('a Visit').","The French 'au monde' (in the world, existing) is translated as 'in Nature.' This broadens the scope from simple existence to existence within the grander, 17th-century philosophical and scientific popularization concept of 'Nature,' thereby making the domain of their non-existence more explicitly defined.","The French 'le contraire' (the contrary) is rendered more specific in the English translation as 'the contrary opinion.' This addition clarifies that 'the contrary' refers specifically to an opposing viewpoint or idea in the context of belief and discussion, rather than any general opposition.","The French 'nüages suspendus' (suspended clouds) describes a physical state. The English translation 'uncertain Clouds' interprets this and the clouds' irregular movement to explicitly state a characteristic—their unpredictable or unfixed nature ('uncertain')—which was only implied.","The French 'deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert' (would become more luminous as soon as it was uncovered) is expanded. The English 'as the Clouds stay, or pass over it' explicitly adds the specific actions of the clouds (staying or passing) as the direct cause for the change in appearance from dark to light, a causal link that was implied by 'découvert' (uncovered by clouds).","The French 'A ce compte-là' (by that account / in that case) implies a logical progression. The English 'for by this reason' makes this logical connection explicit by clearly stating that what follows is a direct consequence or reason derived from the preceding observation.","The French 'C'est donc un Corps' (It is therefore a Body) presents a conclusion more directly. The English 'so that it appears she is a Body' adds 'it appears,' which explicitly frames the statement as an inference or appearance based on observation, rather than a categorical assertion, thus making the epistemic stance of the speaker explicit.","The English translation significantly expands on the French 'qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy?' (that there were Seas in the Moon that one distinguished from here?). It adds the specific details: 'nay, You or your Friends were Godfathers to some of 'em. Pray, what is become of your Caspian Sea, and your Black Lake?'. This makes explicit the earlier act of naming lunar features and provides concrete examples, information implied by the broader context of Fontenelle's work and contemporary astronomical practices but not present in the immediate source sentence.","The French 'J'en suis bien fâché' (I am very sorry about it) is expanded to 'tho' for your Ladyships sake, I am very sorry for it.' The addition 'for your Ladyships sake' explicitly states the philosopher's polite consideration for the Marquise's feelings as a partial motivation for his expressed sorrow, a social nuance implied in the original but spelled out here.","The French 'ma faiblesse' (my weakness) is a straightforward admission. The English translation adds the parenthetical qualification '(if it be one)'. This makes explicit a sense of modesty or a questioning of whether this trait truly constitutes a weakness, a nuance not present in the French.","The English translation prefaces the Marquise's request ('pray fix me quickly in my opinion') with 'therefore,' explicitly linking it to her previously stated inability to remain undetermined. This addition of 'therefore' spells out the logical connection in her reasoning.","The French 'conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais & qu'il n'en soit plus parlé' (let's preserve them, or annihilate them forever & let them no longer be spoken of) is translated and modified to 'preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit'. The addition 'as you shall think fit' makes explicit the Marquise's deference to the philosopher's judgment in making this decision.","The French 'mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre.' (but rather let's preserve them, if possible, I've taken an inclination for them that I would have difficulty losing) is rephrased. The English 'and yet methinks I have a strange inclination for 'em, and would not have 'em destroy'd, if it were possible to save 'em.' more explicitly states her desire for the Moon inhabitants *not to be destroyed*, directly linking her inclination to a preferred negative outcome (avoiding destruction), which is a stronger and more direct plea than the French.","The English translation adds the introductory phrase 'You know, Madam, said I, I can deny you nothing;' before the philosopher agrees to repeople the Moon. This phrase makes explicit his gallant motivation and the personal, deferential dynamic with the Marquise influencing his decision, which is only briefly implied by the French 'pour vous faire plaisir' (to please you).","The French 'nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature' (we know no Body of this nature) is a factual statement. The English 'I am sure we are yet unacquainted with such a Body' adds 'I am sure,' which makes the speaker's personal conviction and level of certainty explicit.","The French 'les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas' (Marbles themselves are not [of that kind/like that]) is concise. The English 'Marble it self is of another Nature' explicitly elaborates on *how* marbles differ, by stating they are 'of another Nature' (i.e., subject to change), thus clarifying the contrast more fully than the implicit contrast in the French.","The French 'l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier' (the air with which the Moon is apparently surrounded in its own particular way) uses 'apparemment' (apparently, seemingly). The English translation replaces this tentative term with the much stronger parenthetical assertion '(for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth)'. This rewrites the level of certainty, making the existence of a lunar atmosphere an explicit and definite claim.","The French 'voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent' (there are its inhabitants who are reborn / behold its inhabitants reborn) is a direct, almost triumphant statement of their rebirth. The English 'here is enough for the new birth of its Inhabitants' shifts to explaining the *sufficiency of the cause* for their rebirth (i.e., the discovery of motion provides the necessary basis), thus making the underlying reasoning for their 'rebirth' more explicit.","The French 'besoins' (needs) is translated as 'wants and use.' The addition of 'and use' expands the concept from mere necessities ('needs,' covered by 'wants') to include the practical application or utilization of these resources by the inhabitants, making the scope of proportionality more explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empêcher la communication des deux Planetes.

The translator makes explicit the idea of a dedicated process of development ('improve it') and an ultimate, absolute goal ('to perfection'), whereas the original French phrasing 'voler fort bien' (to fly very well) primarily suggests achieving a high degree of competence or success in flying. This explicitation potentially reflects Enlightenment-era optimism about human progress and the perfectibility of endeavors.","The French phrase 'dans l'air des Poissons' appears at the end of the sentence 'ils [les Poissons] ne passent jamais dans l'Air des Oiseaux dans l'air des Poissons,' forming a condensed and potentially ambiguous part of the statement about the impassability between environments. The translator expands this condensed element by creating a full, parallel clause: 'nor the Birds into the Air of the Fish.' This addition explicitly spells out the reciprocal nature of the impossibility (that birds also cannot enter the fishes' environment), a relationship that was left unstated or only implied by the concise syntax of the original French.","The French possessive pronoun 'le nôtre' (ours) anaphorically refers to 'notre air' (our air) from the immediately preceding context. The English translation 'our Air' makes this reference explicit by restating the noun 'Air' with the possessive adjective. This choice increases the level of explicitness compared to a more literal rendering like 'ours,' thereby adding clarifying information that was implied in the original.","The French conditional 'se noyeroit' (would drown himself), used in a hypothetical clause, implies a strong likelihood or near certainty of the outcome given the conditions. The English translation 'will inevitably drown himself' makes this implied certainty explicit by adding the adverb 'inevitably' and employing the future indicative tense. This addition foregrounds the deterministic nature of the consequence, emphasizing its inescapability more directly than the French conditional alone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P043: Oh, que j'aurois d'envie, s'écria la Marquise, qu'il arrivât quelque grand naufrage <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">qui répandît icy</span></span> bon nombre de ces Gens- là, dont nous irions considérer à notre aise les figures extraordinaires!

Our Air is nothing but a great Mist, which changeth the true colour of the Sky, of the Sun, and of the Stars; it belongs only to the Celestial Matter to bring us the Light and Colours as they really are in all the purity; so that since the Air of the Moon is of another nature than our Air, or is stain'd of another colour, or at least is another kind of Mist, which causeth other alterations to the Colours of the Celestial Bodies; in short, as to the People of the Moon, their Spectacles through which they see every thing are chang'd.</p>","explanations":["The French \"Genies corporels\" (corporeal spirits/genii) is translated as \"our Faries, whom they alow to be Corporeal\". This involves two layers of re-writing that make the concept more explicit for the target audience: 1) \"Genies,\" a general term for spirits, is specified and domesticated as \"our Faries,\" a more concrete and culturally familiar type of spirit for an English audience of the time. 2) The adjective \"corporels\" (corporeal) is expanded into the clause \"whom they alow to be Corporeal,\" which makes explicit that their corporeality is an attribute conceded or believed by \"they\" (those who have the folly to believe in them), thus clarifying the epistemic status of this characteristic within the described belief system.","The French phrase \"que des plongeons de très peu de durée\" (meaning 'only dives of very short duration') is a general statement. The English translation significantly expands and concretizes this by adding a culturally specific comparison: \"cannot stay half so long in it, as one of the worst of Sir Harry Blount's Sponge- gatherers.\" This addition makes the implicit notion of \"very short duration\" for a dive explicit by providing a vivid, contemporary English reference point (Sir Harry Blount's travel writings were known), thereby re-writing the original's more abstract statement with a detailed, culturally-bound illustration.","The French \"Quelques Modernes\" (Some Moderns) is a relatively general term. The English translation \"Some of our Modern Philosophers\" makes explicit the implied identity of these \"Moderns\" by specifying them as \"Philosophers.\" In the context of Fontenelle's work and the Scientific Revolution, \"Moderns\" discussing astronomical and physical concepts would indeed be natural philosophers (the term for scientists at the time). The translator clarifies this for the reader, ensuring the term is understood in its intended scientific context.","The French \"une espèce de Lunette naturelle\" (a kind of natural lens/telescope) uses the singular \"Lunette,\" which can refer to a general optical instrument, a single lens, or a spyglass/telescope. The English translation \"a kind of Natural Spectacles\" uses the plural \"Spectacles,\" which specifically means eyeglasses. This change makes Fontenelle's metaphor for the air (as an optical medium altering perception) more concrete and specific by explicitly likening it to eyeglasses, a familiar personal item that alters vision, rather than a more general or potentially singular optical device implied by \"Lunette\"."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy.

While 'Petticoat' is a type of 'habit' (garment), 'suit of Knots' (referring to ribbon ornaments) is a very specific interpretation and expansion of 'meuble' (furniture/item), which in a broader 17th-century sense could refer to an 'accessory' or 'furnishing' for clothing. The translator makes this explicit by choosing specific contemporary fashion items, potentially to resonate more directly with the English female reader of the time, thus adding clarifying information that was more general in the original.","The French 'la Nature a bien de l'esprit' (Nature has a good mind/wit/spirit) is translated as 'Nature hath as good a Fancy as Mrs. Harrison'. The addition of 'as Mrs. Harrison' is a clear instance of explicitation by adding a specific cultural reference (likely a contemporary figure known for good taste or 'fancy') that is entirely absent in the source. This addition serves to domesticate and concretize the abstract idea of Nature's 'esprit' for the English audience by comparing it to a known individual, thereby making the implied quality of Nature's ingenuity more explicit and relatable in a specific cultural context.","The French 'Lunettes' (glasses/spectacles, or by extension, telescopes) is translated as 'Spectacles' in the first instance and then clarified within the same paragraph in the English target (not present in the source passage directly but related in example 2 'Perspective-glass, or Tube'). Here, the term 'Spectacles' is used consistently. While 'Lunettes' can mean eyeglasses, in the context of viewing celestial bodies or altering perception as discussed, it can also imply optical instruments like telescopes. The consistent use of 'Spectacles' initially might seem like a direct translation, but the broader context of Fontenelle's work often implies more than just simple eyeglasses when discussing views of the universe. However, in this specific segment, the Marquise refers to 'certaines Lunettes' in the imagination that change how each man sees objects. Here, 'Spectacles' is a reasonable direct translation, but if the translator intended to narrow the meaning from a potentially broader 'optical aids' to specifically 'eyeglasses' as a metaphor for perception, it could be a subtle explicitation. Given the example output provided, the simpler 'Lunettes' to 'Spectacles' might not be flagged unless it's a clear case of disambiguation. However, the *second* instance in the original example where 'Lunettes' becomes 'Perspective-glass, or Tube' *is* explicitation. In the current provided text, the Marquise says 'elle n'a changé que les Lunettes'. The target says 'but only the Spectacles'. This direct translation is not explicitation in itself. Later, 'certaines Lunettes' becomes 'a sort of Spectacles'. This is also fairly direct. This one is borderline. I will include it based on the general principle that 'lunettes' could also refer to telescopes, and 'spectacles' narrows it to eyeglasses, thus making explicit *a particular kind* of 'lunettes'.","The French 'le sejour d'Astrée' (the stay/sojourn of Astraea) is translated as 'a proper residence for Astraea'. The addition of 'proper' and the choice of 'residence' for 'sejour' makes the nature of Astraea's presence more explicit and slightly more formal. 'Sejour' can be temporary, while 'residence' often implies a more established dwelling. 'Proper' adds a qualitative judgment not explicitly in the source, implying suitability."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, répliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mêmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

The English 'so that they cannot strike on the Earth' makes the consequence of the air receiving the rays explicit by using 'so that' to establish a clear causal link, indicating the air's interception prevents the rays from reaching Earth.","The English translation adds 'and therefore,' which explicitly spells out the causal relationship between the air's purity ('Air est plus pur') and its reduced ability to reflect light ('not so proper to send down the Beams'). The French implies this connection, but 'and therefore' makes the logical link explicit.","The French 'cette lumiere de faveur' (this light of favor/boon) is translated as 'that Light of Grace,' and the translator adds the parenthetical comment '(as I may call it).' This addition makes explicit the translator's comment on their own lexical choice or signals the figurative nature of the term 'Light of Grace' in a way not present in the original.","The French 'quoy qu'ils ne nous fussent pas naturellement destinés' (although they were not naturally destined for us) uses 'ne...pas' (not). The English translation 'tho' indeed they were never naturally design'd us' strengthens this to 'never' and adds 'indeed'. This explicitation intensifies the negation and adds an assertion of certainty ('indeed') not directly present in the French, clarifying the degree of non-destination.","The French 'tout l'éclat qui est dans le Soleil' (all the splendor/brilliance that is in the Sun) uses the concise term 'éclat'. The English translation expands this into 'the whole light of the Sun, in all its glory and brightness,' unpacking the semantically rich 'éclat' into distinct components ('light,' 'glory,' 'brightness'), thus making the multifaceted nature of the original term more explicit.","The French sentence states 'Le jour & la nuit ne sont point liez par un milieu qui tienne de l'un & de l'autre' (Day and night are not at all linked by a medium that partakes of both). The English translation, after rendering this core idea, adds the clause 'but you fall in a moment from one extreme into the other.' This addition explicitly describes the dramatic consequence and the subjective experience of this lack of a medium, details which were only implied in the French.","The French uses 'et' (and) in '& nous devons les plus belles choses du monde à celles qui le sont le moins' to connect the observation about beauty to the preceding facts. The English translation uses 'so that the most beautiful things in the World, are produc'd...', which explicitly frames the observation as a conclusion or logical consequence derived from the scientific explanations, thereby spelling out a relationship that was less marked in the source text.","The French text asks about 'les Belles' (the Beauties) and mentions a 'source de comparaisons perduë!' (a lost source of comparisons!). The English translation changes this to 'What must Lovers do for Similies in that Countrey, when such an inexhaustible Magazine of Comparisons is taken from them?'. This makes explicit the connection to 'Lovers' and 'Similies' (implied by 'Belles' and 'comparaisons') and greatly expands 'source' to the more elaborate 'inexhaustible Magazine of Comparisons,' explicitly highlighting the vastness and richness of what is lost."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P048: Je n'aurois pas grand regret à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">ces comparaisons là</span></span>, dit la Marquise, &amp; je trouve qu'on est assez bien recompense dans la Lune, de n'avoir ny Aurore ny Arc-en- ciel, car on ne doit avoir par la même raison ny Foudres ny Tonnerres, puisque ce sont aussi des choses qui se forment dans les nüages.

The translator re-writes this by having the Countess launch into an elaborate speculation, providing concrete examples of witty \"Simily\" (similes) and social repartee imagined to be made by Moon-dwellers, invoking contemporary English social types and settings (\"Beau in Covent-Garden,\" \"Visor-Mask,\" \"Puppet Show\"). This makes the general idea of sophisticated 'comparisons' explicit through vivid, culturally specific, and newly invented illustrations, significantly altering the original's understated remark.","The French \"Nous voyons icy que\" (We see here that/Currently we see that) is general regarding how the subsequent observation about subterranean Rome is known. The translator adds \"in the Ruines of old Rome,\" thereby making explicit the implied historical or archaeological basis through which this knowledge is obtained.","The French \"une Ville à la manière de la Lune.\" (a city in the Moon's fashion.) offers a concise, abstract image of underground cities. The translator re-writes and extensively expands this by providing two lengthy, concrete, and culturally specific analogies: life during the recent siege of Buda and the layout of the Fountain Tavern cellar in London. This makes the concept of a \"Moon-like city\" (i.e., subterranean life) explicit and highly vivid for English readers by detailing imagined scenarios using contemporary and local references, thus spelling out detailed illustrations of Fontenelle's brief suggestion.","The French \"cependant, à vous parler tres serieusement,\" (however, to speak to you very seriously,) is a direct transitional phrase. The English translation substitutes part of this with \"yet if I may be so free with a fair Lady,\". This addition explicitly voices a social consideration – the speaker's polite deference or awareness of addressing a noblewoman (the Countess) – making an element of the implicit social decorum of the dialogue explicit by spelling out a gallant convention.","The French \"un Soleil ardent\" (a burning sun) describes the sun's intrinsic quality. The English translation expands this to \"a scorching Sun always over our Heads\". The addition of \"always over our Heads\" makes explicit the implied constant and direct exposure to such a sun in a cloudless environment, thereby enhancing the vividness of the description by spelling out its perpetual and oppressive presence."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle.

The translator makes the concept explicit by first adding the classical term 'of the Spheres', then providing a detailed explanation of 'Harmony' as 'Musick', and finally adding a culturally specific analogy to a 'Rarée Show' to help the reader comprehend the abstract idea, information not present in the original.","The French 'crient comme des desesperées' (cry/shout like desperate ones) is translated as 'howl like so many Souls in Purgatory'. The translator makes the despair explicit by invoking the specific Christian theological concept of 'Souls in Purgatory', adding a layer of cultural and religious imagery to intensify the meaning of 'desesperées' for the target audience.","The French 'Sur Vénus je reprens le Saint-Denis.' (On Venus I resume the Saint-Denis [a train of thought/comparison]) is translated as 'which puts me again in mind of Greenwich.' The translator replaces an obscure French cultural reference ('le Saint-Denis') with 'Greenwich,' a place of high astronomical importance in England. This explicitation makes the philosopher's associative thought process (linking Venus to a key site for astronomical observation) immediately clear and relevant to the English reader, which would have been lost with a literal translation.","The French 'les Lunettes d'approche' (literally 'approach glasses' or spyglasses) is translated as 'their Tellescopes'. The translator uses the more specific and scientifically recognized term 'Telescopes,' making explicit the precise nature of the instruments used for astronomical observation.","The French description of Venus's phases 'Vénus aussi bien que la Lune est tantôt en Croissant, tantôt en Décours, tantôt pleine' is translated with an added parenthetical comment: 'Venus like the Moon, (if I may speak after the same manner) is sometimes new, sometimes full, and sometimes in the wain'. The translator adds the phrase '(if I may speak after the same manner)', an explicit meta-commentary guiding the reader on the analogical nature of applying lunar phase terminology to Venus.","The French 'en disant toüjours Pourquoy non, vous m'allez mettre des Habitans dans toutes les Planètes?' (by always saying Why not, you are going to put Inhabitants on all the planets?) is translated as 'You are so full of your Whys, and your Wherefores, says she, interrupting me, that I fancy you are sending Colonies to all the Planets.' The translator expands 'Pourquoy non' to the more elaborate 'Whys, and your Wherefores,' making the philosopher's reasoning method explicit. Additionally, 'mettre des Habitans' (put inhabitants) is specified as 'sending Colonies,' adding a concrete method of population and a contemporary colonial resonance.","The French 'il faudroit concevoir que ces grands Corps auroient êté faits pour n'être point habitez, que ce seroit là leur condition naturelle, & qu'il y aurait une exception justement en faveur de la Terre toute seule.' (it would be necessary to conceive that these great Bodies would have been made not to be inhabited, that this would be their natural condition, and that there would be an exception precisely in favor of the Earth alone.) is translated as 'if we are to believe that these vast Bodies are not inhabited, I think they were made but to little purpose; why should Nature be so partial, as to except only the Earth?'. The translator adds the teleological argument 'I think they were made but to little purpose' and the concept of 'Nature' being 'partial', making explicit philosophical considerations about purpose and design not directly stated in the original French.","The Marquise's observation in French describes the philosopher as 'bien affermy dans vôtre opinion' (very firm in your opinion) and likely to 'se mettriez en colere' (get angry). The translation 'I find, says the Countess, with some concern, a Philosopher will never make a good Martyr, you can so quickly shift your Opinion...' adds the explicit generalization 'a Philosopher will never make a good Martyr' and the Countess's emotional state 'with some concern'. This re-writes the specific observation into a broader commentary on the nature of philosophers, making explicit a character judgment and an emotional reaction.","The French 'Il y a des momens pour croire, & je ne les ay jamais si bien crûs que dans celuy là;' (There are moments for believing, and I have never believed them so well as in that one;) is significantly expanded to 'there is a time for all things, and your true Philosopher believes any thing, or nothing, as the Maggot bites. Had you taken me in the sceptical Vein, I would have as soon granted a Nation in a Mustard Ball, as a living Creature in the Moon; but the tide is turn'd, and all the Planets are Peopled like an Anthill;'. The translator makes the philosopher's fleeting conviction explicit by adding a lengthy, idiomatic discourse on the whimsical nature of a 'true Philosopher', complete with hypothetical scenarios and exaggerated examples, extensively re-writing the original concise statement.","The French 'Ciron' (a cheese mite or very small insect) is translated as 'Hand-worm'. The translator makes the type of tiny creature more explicit by using a more specific (for the period) English term, aiming to provide a clearer image for the reader.","The French 'mais au Ciron commence une multitude infinie d'Animaux, dont il est l'Eléphant, & que la simple veuë ne sauroit apercevoir.' (but at the Ciron begins an infinite multitude of Animals, of which it [the ciron] is the Elephant, and which simple sight could not perceive.) is translated as 'and yet counting from that minute Creature, there are an infinity of lesser Animals, which were they perceptible, would be as little in comparison with a Mite, as a Mite is of an Ox.' The translator makes the relative size comparison explicit by rephrasing Fontenelle's 'dont il est l'Eléphant' with a more spelled-out analogy using 'Mite' and 'Ox', thereby clarifying the scale difference for the English reader.","The French 'On a vu avec des Lunettes beaucoup de Liqueurs toutes remplis de petits Animaux que l'on n'aurait jamais soupçonnez d'y être' (One has seen with glasses many liquids all full of small animals that one would never have suspected to be there) is translated as 'How lately have our Virtuoso's found out the Pepper Worms, which in the least drop of Water appear like so many Dolphins, sporting in the Ocean;'. The translator makes the general statement explicit by adding specific contemporary scientific references: 'our Virtuoso's' (English scientists), the example of 'Pepper Worms' (microorganisms in pepper-water, a recent discovery), and a vivid metaphorical description ('like so many Dolphins'), grounding the observation in English scientific context.","The French 'il y a quelque apparence que le goût quelles font sentir, sont les piqueures que ces petits Animaux font à la langue & au palais.' (there is some appearance that the taste they cause to be felt are the pricks/stings that these small animals make on the tongue and palate.) is translated as 'nay, they tell you that the sharpness of Vinegar consists in the fierceness of the little Animals that bite you by the Tongue;'. The translator makes the general explanation of taste explicit by providing the specific example of 'the sharpness of Vinegar' and intensifying the animals' action to 'fierceness' and 'bite', making the abstract idea more concrete and vivid.","The French 'Mêlez de certaines choses dans quelques-unes de ces Liqueurs, ou exposez-les au Soleil, ou laissez-les se corrompre, voilà aussi-tôt de nouvelles especes de petits Animaux.' (Mix certain things in some of these liquids, or expose them to the Sun, or let them corrupt, and behold immediately new species of small animals.) is translated as 'not to name the blue on Plums, and twenty Experiments of the like nature.' The translator replaces the description of general processes for generating microorganisms with explicit examples of where they can be observed, such as 'the blue on Plums' (mold) and a reference to 'twenty Experiments,' thus providing concrete instances familiar to the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut.

The target text \"then you and I can tell what they are now doing at the Antipodes\" makes this implication explicit by specifying the particular aspect of communication that is lacking – the ability to know what the others are doing.","The French \"des especes de pierres tres dures\" (types of very hard stones) is a general description. The translator makes this more explicit by adding a concrete example, \"for Example, in Marble\", thereby clarifying the kind of hard stones Fontenelle might be referring to for the English reader.","The source text has \"ces petits Vers,\" (these little worms/grubs). The target text translates this as \"these invisible Mites,\". \"Mites\" offers a more specific type of creature than the general \"Vers.\" The addition of \"invisible\" is drawn from Fontenelle's earlier descriptions in the same passage (e.g., \"Vermisseaux invisibles,\" \"Animaux imperceptibles\") and is made explicit again here, reinforcing a key characteristic of these creatures that was contextually implicit for \"ces petits Vers.\"","The source text states \"Enfin tout est vivant, tout est animé:\" (In short, everything is living, everything is animated). The translator makes the radical scope of this universal claim explicit by adding a culturally specific and vivid example, \"and the Stones upon Salisbury Plain are as much alive, as a Hive of Bees;\". This addition clarifies for an English audience that \"everything\" includes even large, seemingly inert ancient structures, illustrating the breadth of Fontenelle's philosophical assertion.","The French \"un autre air.\" (another air/look/appearance/manner) is somewhat general. The target text \"a different Air and Fashion;\" expands on this by adding \"Fashion,\" which specifies a particular aspect of the \"air\" (style or make), thus making the nature of the potential difference in appearance more explicit.","The source text offers a tentative philosophical reflection: \"& ceux-là ne sont peut-être pas les plus malheureux.\" (and those, perhaps, are not the most unhappy). The target text transforms this into a more direct and personalized judgment: \"which by the way, I think, is much the better:\". This makes the implied positive assessment of that state more explicit and assertive.","The French \"On dit qu'il pourroit bien nous manquer un sixiéme Sens naturel,\" (It is said that we might well lack a sixth natural Sense,) uses \"nous\" (we/us) which implicitly refers to humans on Earth. The target text \"Here, 'tisthought we want a sixth Sense,\" adds \"Here,\" explicitly localizing the thought or lack to the terrestrial context, clarifying the implied setting.","The French \"& on s'ennuye.\" (and one gets bored / and they get bored) describes a general state. The English translation \"and time lies on their hands;\" uses an idiom that makes a common manifestation or cause of boredom – an excess of unoccupied time – explicit, thereby clarifying the nature of the ennui.","The source text \"& de les égaler en même temps que les compensations.\" (and to make them equal at the same time as/by/through compensations) suggests the means of equalization. The target text \"and at the same time makes 'em equal, by compensating for the inequality;\" spells out the instrumental relationship more explicitly by clarifying that equality is achieved *through the act of* compensating for a pre-existing inequality."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux?

The target translation replaces this with \"Trouble not your self,\" which explicitly articulates a sentiment of reassurance. This reassurance is implied in the source by the Marquise's subsequent confident explanation of her comprehension, suggesting she is not overwhelmed by the \"chimeres\" presented.","The source sentence \"Mon imagination travaille sur le plan que vous mavez donné\" (My imagination works on the plan you gave me) indicates the active process of her imagination. The target, while omitting a direct translation of the full sentence, introduces the aphoristic phrase \"Fancy is a great Traveller.\" This explicitly states a powerful, inherent characteristic of imagination (its ability to explore widely or \"travel\" through complex concepts), thereby explaining *why* her imagination is effective. This enabling characteristic was only implied by the source's statement that her imagination \"works\" on the provided \"plan.\""]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P054: QUATRIEME SOIR.

This addition explicitly frames her subsequent words as a direct clarification of her preceding statement, a rhetorical link that is less overtly signaled in the source, thus re-writing the flow of her reasoning by making her communicative intent more explicit.","The French 'une Planete qui soit jolie, claire, brillante, & qui ait un air galant' (a planet that is pretty, clear, brilliant, and has a gallant air) describes the planet's qualities. The English translation adds the explicit comparison 'as the Goddess her self,' directly linking the planet's attributes to the goddess Venus. This makes explicit a connection that was only implied in the source's description of the planet named Venus.","The French 'ces Gens là doivent nien entendre la galanterie' (those people there must really understand gallantry) is a concise remark by the Marquise. The English translation drastically expands this by adding a long, detailed complaint ('where all they say... Farce, or Funeral.') contrasting the supposed refinement of Venusians with a satirical depiction of contemporary (likely English) courtship. This extensive addition re-writes the original simple observation into a significant piece of social commentary, making explicit a critique not present in Fontenelle's text.","The philosopher's original reply in French begins 'Oh! sans doute, répondis-je,' (Oh! undoubtedly, I replied,). The English translation inserts a substantial, entirely new passage ('if some of our Beaux speak plain English...Bows and Arrows:') into this reply. This added text offers a defense of contemporary English manners and wit, a theme absent in Fontenelle's original. This re-writing alters the philosopher's speech by making him explicitly engage in a contemporary debate that is an artifact of the translator's context, not the source text's.","The French 'le menu Peuple de Vénus n'est composé que de Celadons & de Silvandres, & leurs Conversations le plus communes valent les plus belles de Clesie' states that common Venusians are as refined as literary characters (Celadons, Silvandres) and their conversations match the best of 'Clélie'. The English translation re-writes this by adding 'Parthenissa,' then explicitly claiming that such romances are *inferior* to the language of 'Grooms and Chamber Maids' on Venus, and further illustrates this by stating 'every Porter and Car-Man' is 'a perfect Sir Courtly' (a contemporary English comedic character). This explicitation significantly exaggerates the Venusian refinement and re-frames it with specific, contemporary English cultural and social references, thus altering the original comparison's nature and impact.","The French 'une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur' (a more vivid light and more heat) describes the direct physical conditions on Venus. The English translation 'a more vigorous and active influence' explicates the *effect* or *consequence* of these conditions. By using 'influence,' the translator spells out that the increased light and heat are understood to have a broader, more dynamic impact, making explicit the nature of the sun's power on Venus beyond just being sources of light and warmth."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, interrompit la Marquise, comment sont faits les Habitans de Vénus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Ils ressemblent aux Mores Grenadins</span></span>; un petit Peuple noir, brûlé du Soleil, plein d'esprit &amp; de feu, toûjours amoureux, faisant des Vers, aimant la Musique, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">inventant tous les jours des Fêtes, des Danses, &amp; des Tournois.</span></span> Permettez-moy de vous dire, Madame, répliquai-je, que vous ne connaissez guère bien les Habitans de Vénus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Nos Mores Grenadins</span></<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">span></span></span> n'auroient été auprés d'eux que des Lappons &amp; des Groënlandois pour la froideur &amp; pour la stupidité.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P047: I find, says the Countess, it is easie enough to guess at the Inhabitants of Venus; they resemble what I have read of the Moors of Granada, who were a little black People, scorch'd with the Sun, witty, full of Fire, very Amorous, much inclin'd to Musick and Poetry, and ever inventing Masques and Turnaments in honour of their Mistresses.

The translation \"they resemble what I have read of the Moors of Granada\" makes this basis explicit by adding \"what I have read of,\" clarifying that her knowledge is derived from reading, a detail not overtly stated in the source.","The French describes the Venusians as \"toûjours amoureux\" (always amorous) and separately as \"inventant tous les jours des Fêtes, des Danses, & des Tournois\" (inventing every day festivals, dances, and tournaments). The translation explicitly links these by adding \"in honour of their Mistresses\" to the act of invention, thereby spelling out a direct motivation that was only loosely implied by the proximity of the two descriptions in the source.","The translator adds the adjective \"gallant\" (and the possessive \"your\") when the philosopher refers to the Moors (\"your gallant Moors\"). \"Gallant\" makes explicit a quality (chivalrous, spirited, amorous) that can be inferred from the Marquise's preceding romanticized description of the Moors (\"plein d'esprit & de feu, toûjours amoureux,\" etc.). The original \"Nos Mores Grenadins\" is a more neutral term from the philosopher. This addition clarifies the philosopher's subtle acknowledgement of the Marquise's perception.","When initiating the counter-comparison, the translator shifts the immediate subject from the people (\"Nos Mores Grenadins\") to the place (\"Granada\") and adds the qualifying phrase \"in all its Glory.\" This addition explicitly specifies an idealized or peak cultural state for Granada as the basis of comparison, a nuance that was at best implied for the people in the source but is now overtly stated for the place, thereby adding clarifying information.","The translator fundamentally re-writes the philosopher's comparative analogy. The French uses a single comparison: the \"Mores Grenadins\" (people) would be like \"Lappons & des Groënlandois\" (people) in terms of both \"froideur\" (coldness) and \"stupidité\" (stupidity) when compared to Venusians. The English translation creates two distinct, more articulated comparisons: first, \"Granada in all its Glory\" (place) is likened to \"Greenland\" (a notably cold place) to represent extreme \"coldness\" relative to Venus (\"to it\"); second, \"your gallant Moors\" (people) are compared to \"Laplanders\" (people) for \"stupidity.\" This restructuring explicitly separates the two negative qualities and assigns them to different types of analogies (place-to-place for coldness, people-to-people for stupidity), thereby spelling out the argument in a more elaborate and altered rhetorical manner."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P058: Mais que sera-ce des Habitants de Mercure?

This changes the source of their madness from an internal overabundance of 'liveliness' to being filled with an external element, thus clarifying the implied solar influence in a more direct and elemental way, altering the original nuance.","The French \"Petites Maisons\" (literally \"small houses\") is a contemporary euphemism for lunatic asylums. The translation \"Bedlam\" makes this implied meaning of 'asylums' explicit by using the proper name of a specific, well-known London asylum active at the time of translation. This clarifies the nature of these institutions for the English reader by substituting the general French euphemism with a concrete and culturally resonant English equivalent, thus re-writing the generic into the specific.","The French \"au fond de l'Afrique\" (\"deep in Africa\" or \"in the heart of Africa\") refers to an extremely hot, somewhat generalized location. The translation \"in the Torrid Zone\" makes the nature of this heat more explicit by replacing the general geographical reference with a precise climatological and geographical term. This adds a layer of scientific specificity, clarifying that the reference is to the formally defined hottest zone of the Earth, which was only implied by \"au fond de l'Afrique.\"","The French \"pendant ce temps-là\" (\"during that time\") anaphorically refers to 'the night.'

The translation \"they appear less to them in Mercury, than they do to us here\" makes these locations explicit by adding the phrases \"in Mercury\" (to specify the viewpoint of \"them,\" the Mercurians) and \"here\" (to specify the viewpoint of \"us,\" the Earthlings). This spells out the comparative frames of reference that were left unstated in the French.","The French \"c'est, selon moy, une perte\" (\"it is, in my opinion, a loss\") is a direct statement of the philosopher-narrator's opinion. The translation \"which were I there, I should esteem a very great loss\" re-writes this by adding the explicit hypothetical condition \"were I there\" (i.e., on Mercury).

The English translation \"the Sun is the source or Fountain of Light\" expands the single word \"la source\" to \"the source or Fountain.\" This explicitation spells out the common metaphorical imagery of a fountain of light, which is latent in the word \"source\" but made more direct and vivid for the reader in the translation.","The French \"On est bien embarrassé à le dire\" (One is very puzzled/embarrassed to say) is an impersonal statement indicating the difficulty or uncertainty of defining the Sun's nature. The English translation \"has often puzled better heads than mine\" makes the implicit intellectual humility and the general difficulty of the question more explicit by personalizing the statement (\"mine\") and employing an idiomatic expression (\"better heads than mine\"). This addition clarifies the narrator's stance and the challenging nature of the scientific question.","The French text presents the supposed properties and behavior of sunspots (as planets) as an elaboration linked by a semicolon and \"que\" (\"; qu'elles avoient un mouvement...\"), implying an explanatory relationship. The English translation \"; for those Planets moving round the Sun...\" introduces the conjunction \"for.\" This explicitly signals that the following clause provides the reason or mechanism by which these supposed planets would appear as spots (by hiding part of the Sun), thereby making the logical connection of explanation, which was less direct in the French juxtapositional structure, explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

The translation makes this implied value and transactional nature highly explicit. It first states that parting with a star is \"on very good terms\" and then adds an entirely new, concrete economic comparison: \"let me tell you, an Acre of Land in England, is worth ten thousand in the Moon,\". This addition re-writes the philosopher's more abstract point into a vivid, relatable example using contemporary English references, clarifying the implied potential value for the English reader.","The source states that philosophers could \"make no use of\" sunspots (\"ils n'en purent faire aucun usage\"), implying their worthlessness as assets, especially in contrast to the Moon's territories previously discussed. The translation first renders this idea dynamically as their value having \"fallen to nothing.\" It then makes this implied worthlessness explicitly clear by adding a culturally specific and contemporary financial comparison: \"the actions of Pensilvania are not half so low,\". This addition benchmarks the sunspots' lack of value against a known (and possibly speculative) colonial investment of the era, thereby clarifying the concept's magnitude for an English reader.","The French \"Lunettes\" (literally \"glasses\"), used in the phrase \"avec des Lunettes\" in the context of observing new solar phenomena like mountains on the sun, implies astronomical telescopes rather than ordinary spectacles. The translator makes this specific, contextually-derived meaning explicit by using the unambiguous English term \"Tellescopes,\" thus clarifying for the reader the precise scientific instrument being referred to.","Similar to the previous instance, the French \"Lunettes\" in the phrase \"s'il faut se défier des Lunettes même\" (if one must distrust the 'glasses' themselves) refers to telescopes, as these are the instruments providing new astronomical knowledge. The translator again makes this specific meaning explicit by using \"Tellescopes\" (\"distrust our Tellescopes\"), reinforcing the clarification of the scientific instrument vital to the discussion.","The French phrase \"quelque chose qui arrive\" (something that happens/occurs), referring to what happens in the \"Lunettes\" to cause a \"pure vision\" of mountains on the sun, is vague about the nature of this cause. The translation \"a fault\" (in \"a fault in the Spectacles\") explicitly specifies that this \"quelque chose\" is a defect or flaw within the optical instrument. This provides a more concrete and specific explanation for the visual artifact than the original text offered.","The French term \"l'étude\" in \"l'étude des Astres\" primarily means \"the study\" or \"learning\" of the stars. While it implies that the acquisition of knowledge is the goal or result of such study, this outcome is not explicitly stated. The translation \"the study or knowledge of the Stars\" makes this implied result explicit by adding \"or knowledge,\" thereby expanding the semantic scope of \"l'étude\" to clearly encompass both the intellectual process and its intended product."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P063: J'avoüe que je m'étois trompé, répondis-je, je ne songeois qu'à la situation où est le Soleil,&amp; non à l'effet de sa lumiere; mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">vous qui me redressez si à propos</span></span>, vous voulez bien que je vous dise que vous vous êtes trompée aussi; les Habitans du Soleil ne le verroient seulement pas.

The English translation 'which is another reason why' explicitly spells out the logical connection, framing the subsequent statement ('the Sun cannot be inhabited') as a specific reason derived from the preceding discussion about blindness, a causal link that was only implied by the transitional phrase in the source.","The French 'il faudroit presentement retourner sur nos pas, & remonter.' (it would be necessary now to retrace our steps, and go up again.) describes the necessary next step in their journey from the center. The English 'if we go on, we must ascend;' makes the implied condition for taking this step (i.e., the continuation of their 'Voyage des Mondes') explicit by adding the conditional clause 'if we go on.'","The French 'enfin Mars ne vaut pas trop la peine qu'on s'y arrête.'

The English translation \"Must my Head... turn round to comprehend 'em\" makes this purpose explicit by adding the phrase \"to comprehend 'em,\" clarifying the reason for the potential head-turning.","The French \"Achevez de me rendre folle\" (Finish making me mad/a fool) is expanded in the English \"or must I become a perfect Fool to understand the misteries of Philosophy?\". The translation not only intensifies \"folle\" to \"a perfect Fool\" but also explicitly states the cause of this \"madness\" as the effort \"to understand the misteries of Philosophy,\" which was only implied in the French to be the difficult subject matter.","The French \"permis à elles d'avoir...mouvements particuliers\" (allowed to them to have...particular movements) is translated as \"every one is allow'd, or has a particular Motion of its own.\" The addition of \"or has\" alongside \"is allow'd\" makes it explicit that the parts not only are permitted to have these individual motions but actually possess them as an inherent characteristic, shifting from an implied potential to an asserted actuality.","The French \"un Tourbillon de vent\" (a vortex/whirlpool of wind) is translated as \"a Vortex of Wind, or Whirlwind.\" The addition of \"or Whirlwind\" explicitly provides a common, more familiar English equivalent for the meteorological phenomenon, enhancing clarity and accessibility for the English reader.","The French \"Tout ce grand amas de matiere celeste\" (All this great mass of celestial matter) is translated as \"this great Mass, or Ocean of Celestial Matter.\" The addition of \"or Ocean\" as an alternative to \"Mass\" (for \"amas\") explicitly provides a vivid metaphor that expands the reader's understanding of the celestial matter, emphasizing its vastness and fluid-like nature more concretely.","The French \"qui est depuis le Soleil jusqu'aux Etoiles fixes\" (which is from the Sun to the fixed Stars), describing the extent of celestial matter, uses the static verb \"est\" (is). The translation \"which flows as far as from the Sun to the fix'd Stars\" replaces \"is\" with \"flows,\" explicitly imbuing the celestial matter with a dynamic, fluid quality consistent with the vortex theory, a characteristic not explicitly stated by the original \"est.\"","The French \"elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle- même\" (it could still do no less than turn on itself) implies a comparison to the Sun's rotation, which was just mentioned. The English translation \"it must turn on it self, as the Sun does\" makes this comparison explicit by adding the clarifying clause \"as the Sun does.\"","The French \"dont le Soleil est comme le Maître\" (of which the Sun is like the Master) is translated as \"of which the Sun is Lord.\" While \"Maître\" means \"Master,\" the choice of \"Lord\" in 17th/18th-century English could carry stronger and more formal connotations of absolute dominion and authority over its celestial system, thus making the Sun's hierarchical position more explicit and emphatic.","The French \"S'il faut qu'il tombe...\" (If it must be that it falls... / If it happens that it falls...) is rendered in English with the addition of \"by chance\" in \"and if by chance, a lesser Planet falls...\". This addition explicitly emphasizes the fortuitous or accidental nature of a smaller planet's capture by a larger planet's vortex, a specific nuance of contingency that is less prominent in the original French phrasing.","The French \"la voilà emportée par la grande\" (there it is, carried away by the large one) indicates a direct consequence. The English translation \"it is immediately born away by the greater\" adds the word \"immediately,\" explicitly clarifying the swiftness and directness of the lesser planet's capture, a temporal detail not explicit in the original \"la voilà.\"","The French \"& tout à fait à notre bienséance.\" (and entirely to our suitability/convenience) is translated as \"and therefore wholly at our dispose:\". The phrase \"wholly at our dispose\" makes Earth's control over the Moon more explicit and absolute than the original's \"à notre bienséance.\" Furthermore, the addition of \"therefore\" explicitly spells out the causal relationship (Moon in vortex -> Moon at Earth's disposal), a connection that was implicit in the French.","The French \"si nous nous fussions trouvés proches de luy?\" (if we had found ourselves close to him [Jupiter]?) indicates simple physical proximity. The English translation \"had we been within the Sphere of his Activity;\" makes explicit *why* this proximity matters by introducing the more technical and explanatory phrase \"Sphere of his Activity,\" clarifying that it refers to being within Jupiter's range of influence (e.g., its vortical pull).","In the French \"Il est quatre vingt- dix-fois plus gros que nous,\" (He is ninety times bigger than us), the pronoun \"nous\" (us) contextually refers to the Earth. The English translation \"he is ninety times bigger than the Earth\" makes this referent explicit by replacing \"nous\" with \"the Earth,\" directly naming the celestial body being compared and removing any potential ambiguity.","The French \"une Lune de sa dépendance\" (a Moon of its dependence, or a dependent Moon) describes a subordinate relationship. The English translation \"a Moon in his Family\" makes the nature of this subordination more explicit and vivid by using the metaphor of a \"Family,\" which implies a hierarchical structure and a more personal, though still subordinate, connection to Jupiter.","The French \"nous en avons une qui est dans la nôtre\" (we have one that is in ours [i.e., our dependence/vortex]) describes the Moon's relationship to Earth. The English translation \"we have one to wait on us\" explicitly personifies this relationship by suggesting an act of service (\"to wait on us\"), making the Moon's subordinate role more graphic and relatable than the more neutral \"dans la nôtre.\""]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes?

The English translation \"if we should be such Fools as to go near\" explicitly characterizes the agents (those approaching Jupiter) as \"Fools.\" This makes the judgment about the people involved more direct and explicit than the original phrasing, which focused on the abstract \"folly\" of the action.","The French clause \"ou qu'il ne vienne vers nous pour nous absorber;\" (or that he [Jupiter] comes towards us to absorb us;) describes Jupiter's potential action and its dire purpose. The English translation rephrases the action as \"or he so ambitious as to approach us\" and then adds the explicit question \"what will become of us?\". This question spells out the Marquise's ensuing fear and uncertainty about their fate, which was only implicitly suggested by the severity of the action \"absorber\" in the source.","The French phrase \"où vous dites qu'est la matière Celeste\" (where you say the Celestial matter is) attributes a statement to the philosopher within the syntactic flow of the sentence. The English translation inserts the parenthetical phrase \"(as you say)\", which makes this attribution more explicit and foregrounded, highlighting that the Marquise is referencing the philosopher's prior assertion.","The French \"Mais nous n'avons rien à esperer ny à craindre;\" (But we have nothing to hope nor to fear;) is a general statement in its immediate phrasing. The English translation \"but in this particular, Madam, we need not hope or fear;\" adds \"in this particular,\" which explicitly narrows the scope of the assurance to the specific topic of planetary movement and stability, a limitation that was previously only implied by context. The addition of \"Madam\" also makes the form of address explicit.","The French \"un Corps extremement léger\" (an extremely light body/object) uses the general term \"Corps\". The English translation \"a very light Liquor\" explicitly specifies the state of matter as liquid. This adds clarifying information about the nature of the \"body\" being discussed in the analogy, a detail not explicitly present in the source.","Similarly to the previous instance, the general French term \"un autre Corps plus pesant\" (another heavier body/object) is translated as \"an heavier Liquor\". This translation makes explicit the assumption that this \"body\" is a liquid, adding a specific detail (state of matter) not specified in the original, thereby narrowing its potential meaning.","The French \"à differentes couches qui s'enveloppent les unes les autres\" (has different layers that envelop one another) describes the physical structure of celestial matter. The English translation \"hath several resting places, one by another\" reinterprets \"couches\" (layers) as \"resting places.\" This makes explicit the *function* of these layers within the cosmological model being explained (i.e., as stable locations where planets settle), a function that was implied by the broader argument but not by the descriptive term \"couches\" itself."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P067: Je conçois, dit la Marquise, que ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs.

A Night six Years long, is <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">a little disconsolate</span></span>, and 'tis for that reason, I suppose, they have four Moons; that which (in regard to Jupiter) is uppermost, finisheth its course about him in seventeen days, the second in seven, the third in three days and an half, and the fourth in two and forty hours; and tho' they are so unfortunate as to have six years Night, yet their course being exactly divided into halves, they never pass above one and twenty hours, wherein they do not see at least the last Moon, which is a great comfort in so tedious a darkness; so that be where you will, these four Moons are sometimes the prettiest sight imaginable; sometimes they rise all four together, and then separate according to the inequality of their course; sometimes they are all in their Meridian, rang'd one above another, sometimes you see 'em at equal distances on the Horizon, sometimes when two rise, the other two go down. Oh, how I should love to see this pleasant sport of Eclipses; for there is not a Day passes but they Eclipse the Sun, or one another; and they are so accustom'd to this diversion in Jupiter, that the late Duke of B-m in his Rehersal, brought the dance of Eclipses from that Planet, as now most of our modish Dances come out of France.</p>","explanations":["The French phrase \"fort en repos\" (very much at ease/peace) implies a general state of reassurance regarding Jupiter, without specifying the nature of any previous concerns.

The target text re-writes this by framing their relationship to Jupiter in socio-political terms, explicitly stating they should be 'Colonies under Jupiter's Government' and receive 'Laws and Customs from him.' This makes explicit a potential hierarchical power dynamic, implied by earlier terms like 'subalternes' and 'asservies' (P070), by articulating it as a colonial governance structure not specified by Fontenelle in this manner.","The source text (P070) uses the term 'asservies' (subservient/enslaved) to describe the relationship of Jupiter's moons to the planet. The target text, in a lengthy speech inserted by the translator and attributed to the philosopher, makes this abstract concept of being 'asservies' explicit by elaborating it into a concrete political hierarchy. It suggests formal political actions ('send Deputies with Addresses to him') and describes Jupiter's rule as an 'absolute command,' thereby spelling out the implied power dynamics and consequences of subservience in detailed socio-political terms not present in Fontenelle's original dialogue here.","The source text refers to Jupiter as 'cette monstrueuse Planete' (this monstrous Planet) from the perspective of its moon's inhabitants, implying great size and/or proximity that inspires awe or fear. The target text, within a larger passage inserted by the translator, makes this implicit characteristic explicit by providing specific astronomical details: 'for that Moon which is nearest to him, sees that he is three hundred and sixty times bigger than our Moon appears to us...he is also much nearer to them'. This spells out the scientific reasons for Jupiter's 'monstrous' appearance, adding a layer of scientific clarification.","The source text has the Marquise rhetorically ask if the moon inhabitants' exemption from fear of eclipses must be 'replaced by some other foolishness' ('& qu'il faut bien remplacer par quelque autre sottise?'). The target text makes this implied substitution explicit by first stating a general principle, 'Every one has their due folly,' and then clearly itemizing the contrasting fears: 'we are afraid of an Eclipse, and they, that Jupiter will fall on their Heads.' This directly spells out the nature of the 'autre sottise' and draws the comparison explicitly.","The source text states that Tycho Brahe did not fear eclipses 'comme le Vulgaire les craint' (as the common people fear them). The target text explicates the nature and intensity of the common people's fear by expanding this into 'when every body else was under the greatest consternation.' This addition of descriptive intensity clarifies what 'le Vulgaire les craint' entails, thereby heightening the contrast with Tycho's scientific detachment more explicitly."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit- elle, après que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">cet homme-là</span></span> n'a pû se delivrer impunément <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">de la</span></span>, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The English translation makes this surprise explicit by incorporating it directly into the Countess's dialogue as the utterance `this is very surprizing`.","The French `a eu en veüe` (had in view/considered) is expanded to `took time to consider`, making the deliberative aspect of Nature's process more explicit. Furthermore, `quelques Etres vivans` (some living beings) is rendered as `all animate Beings`, explicitly broadening the scope of Nature's consideration from 'some' to 'all' relevant beings.","The French states that their nights are very short (`dont les nuits sont fort courtes`) and subsequently that they count these nights as blessings (`& qui les comptent...`). The English translation makes the implied causal link between the shortness of the nights and their being valued explicit by inserting the parenthetical clarifying phrase `(as short as they are)` when stating the nights are accounted a blessing.","The French text has the Marquise making an observation: `il me semble que Mars... n'a point de Lune` (it seems to me that Mars... has no moon). This implies puzzlement. The English translation makes this implied query explicit by rephrasing her realization as a direct question: `why has not Mars a Moon too?`.","The French `des ressources` (resources) refers to means by which Mars might illuminate its nights. The English translation uses `other helps`. The addition of 'other' makes explicit the implied idea that these 'helps' are alternatives to the moons previously discussed, a contrast clear from context but not explicitly stated in the French term.","The French `la lumiere du Soleil` (sunlight) is translated as `the rays of the Sun`. Specifying 'rays' makes the mechanism of light absorption by phosphorus slightly more concrete and 'scientific' in tone for a popularizing work, thereby making an implicit characteristic of light (its ray-like nature in this interaction) explicit.","The French `des illuminations magnifiques` (magnificent illuminations) is made more concrete and culturally specific in English by likening them to `so many Illuminations at a Birth day night`. This simile provides a familiar example of grand illuminations for the contemporary English reader, making a specific type or image of magnificence explicit through cultural analogy, while the original French emphasized their naturalness (`sans aucun art`), which is omitted in this part of the English rendering.","The French `un grand nombre de ces Oiseaux` (a large number of these birds) is translated as `great flocks of these Birds`. While 'a large number' might imply birds gathering, 'flocks' explicitly describes them as organized groups, making the imagery of the birds more specific by clarifying their collective behavior.","The French `vont répandre un nouveau jour` (go and spread a new day/light) describes the effect of the luminous birds. The English translation adds the detail `from their wings` (`spread from their wings another day`), specifying a means by which the light is spread. This detail is not present in the source text and makes explicit a potential, vivid mechanism for the light dispersal."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oiseaux.

The English translation specifies this by adding \"in Mars\" (\"'tis a sign that there should be Moons in Mars,\"), explicitly linking the general observation to Mars, a specific point of concern for the Marquise. This spells out a connection that is only implied to be made in the subsequent sentence in the source text.","The French text \"si Mars ne nous fût point venu faire une exception desagreable\" (if Mars had not come to make a disagreeable exception) expresses a regret about Mars being an exception. The English translation transforms this into an explicit rhetorical question, \"why should Mars only be excepted?\", thereby spelling out the unstated inquiry or frustration that the Marquise implicitly feels about this exception.","The French exclamation \"vraiment\" (indeed, truly) serves as an intensifier for the philosopher's assertion. The English translation, within the phrase \"Ah, Madam, said I,\" replaces \"vraiment\" with the vocative \"Madam.\" This addition makes the direct address to the Marquise explicit at this specific point of interjection, clarifying the immediate recipient of the philosopher's remark, which was only implied by the broader conversational context in the French.","The French \"ou qu'on laisse-là, si on desespere d'en pouvoir venir à bout\" describes leaving something aside due to despairing of success. The English translation rephrases this as a direct piece of advice: \"those you must leave as you found 'em, if ever you intend to make an end:\". This makes explicit the pragmatic reason for abandoning problematic elements (i.e., \"if ever you intend to make an end\"), a motivation which is only implied in the French emphasis on 'despair'.","The French \"& ne parlons point de luy\" (and let's not speak of him [Mars]) serves to close the discussion on Mars. The English translation expands this by adding \"but return to Saturn,\" explicitly stating the next topic of conversation and thereby guiding the dialogue's progression, a transition that was left implicit in the French.","The French \"Nous serions bien étonnez, si nous êtions dans Saturne, de voir\" (We would be very astonished, if we were in Saturn, to see) introduces the description of Saturn's ring through a conditional statement about a shared hypothetical experience. The English translation changes this rhetorical strategy to a direct question posed to the Marquise: \"What do you think of\", thus making the philosopher's attempt to engage her and solicit her opinion more explicit.","The French phrase \"à en envoyer par tout assez hardiment\" (to send them everywhere quite boldly) refers to sending \"Habitans\" (inhabitants), as implied from the preceding dialogue. The English translation \"I could almost send Colonies every where;\" makes this more specific by using the word \"Colonies.\" This addition clarifies the nature of populating other worlds by likening it to organized settlement, adding a layer of concrete imagery not explicitly present in the French.","The French \"mais quelle lumiere,\" (but what light!) is a rhetorical exclamation that implies the poor quality of the light from Saturn's ring. The English translation makes this implication explicit by stating directly, \"but it must be a very poor one,\", thus clearly spelling out the inferred characteristic of the light.","The French text describes a hypothetical scenario: \"si vous les mettiez dans nos Pays les plus froids... vous les verriez suër à grosses gouttes & expirer de chaud\" (if you put them in our coldest countries... you would see them sweat profusely and expire from heat), implying an extreme temperature difference makes Earth's cold lethal to Saturnians. The English translation makes this comparison explicit and more vivid by stating \"Greenland is a perfect Bagnio in comparison of that Planet,\". This directly frames Greenland as intensely hot relative to Saturn, using the specific term \"Bagnio\" to articulate the severity of the heat that was only described by its effects in French, and spelling out the comparative relationship with \"in comparison of that Planet\"."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P080: Vous me donnez une idée de Saturne qui <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">me gele</span></span>, dit la Marquise, au lieu que tan tôt <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">vous m'échauffiez</span></span> en me parlant de Mercure.

The English 'makes me shake with cold' explicates this by adding a specific physical reaction or symptom associated with being extremely cold. This adds a layer of descriptive detail about the Marquise's physical response and the idea's effect on her, which was only implied by the more general verb in the source.","The French 'vous m'échauffiez' (you were warming me / exciting me) suggests a general increase in temperature or excitement. The English translation 'puts me into a feaver' explicates and intensifies this sensation by specifying it as a more extreme, physiological state of high excitement or agitation. This re-writing makes the Marquise's reaction more vivid and dramatic than the more general term used in the source.","The French 'trop badin & trop folâtre' (too playful/joking and too frolicsome/light-hearted) describes the Saturnians' view of Cato as insufficiently serious. The English translation 'a merry Andrew' re-writes this judgment by making the Saturnians perceive Cato as a specific type of buffoon or clown. This explicitation introduces a concrete, culturally specific English archetype not present in the French, significantly intensifying the criticism and altering the nuance from Cato being merely 'too lighthearted' by Saturnian standards to being considered an outright fool."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P082: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Il me vient une pensée</span></span>, dit-elle.

This makes explicit a potential societal perception of the unconventional nature of the topics discussed, a nuance only implicitly present in the original phrasing within its historical context.","The French \"sont lents\" (are slow) attributes a specific quality to Saturn's inhabitants. The English \"quite contrary\" goes beyond describing them as merely slow; it explicitly defines their nature in direct, heightened opposition to the previously mentioned lively inhabitants of Mercury.

However, the context \"nous sommes justement dans un endroit de la Terre\" (we are precisely in a place on Earth) implies that the speaker (the Marquise) refers to her own specific, temperate, and favored location (implicitly France in the original). The English translation \"our Country\" makes this implied specificity and the speaker's proprietary connection to the location explicit by using the possessive \"our\" and specifying the nature of the place as a \"Country.\" This instance of explicitation also functions as re-writing, as it aligns the location with the anglicized persona of the speaker (the Countess, presumed English by the target audience through other adaptive changes in the translation)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P084: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Mon Dieu!</span></span> répliqua-t-elle, laissez-moy avoir de la reconnaissance sur tout, jusque sur le Tourbillon où je suis placée.

The addition of \"Sir\" makes explicit the addressee (the philosopher) at the very beginning of the Marquise's utterance. While the addressee is clear from the context in French, the English translation spells out this direct address immediately. This re-writes the interjection into a polite, direct address, altering the initial tone and making the act of addressing explicit.","The French \"de moy\" (of me), a simple self-reference by the philosopher, is translated as \"an humble Servant of your Ladyships.\" This elaborate phrase makes explicit a social positioning of deference and humility from the philosopher towards the Marquise, a convention perhaps expected in the English socio-cultural context of the translation. This detailed social relationship was not explicitly stated in the original's simple pronoun.","The Marquise's French request, \"mais faites que la Philosophie me fournisse toûjours des plaisirs nouveaux\" (but ensure that Philosophy always provides me with new pleasures), shows her desire for ongoing novel philosophical enjoyment. The English translation modifies her sentiment by adding the conditional phrase \"while it diverts innocently, but no longer.\" This makes explicit a set of conditions—innocence and limited duration—for her acceptance of philosophy as a pleasure. These qualifications are not present in the French and re-write her attitude to be more cautious or socially circumspect.","The French phrase \"un goût qui les mette à profit\" (a taste that puts them to use/profit) describes a disposition for appreciating common things. The English translation \"improve continually what we have\" rephrases this by making explicit an active and ongoing process of enhancement (\"improve continually\"). This changes the focus from possessing a \"taste\" to performing an action of continuous betterment, thereby explicating a specific, more dynamic interpretation of how one should \"mettre à profit\" (profit from/make use of) these things.","The French philosopher directly asks the Marquise for a promise using the phrase \"Vous me promettez donc...?\" (So you promise me...?). The English translation changes this direct, interrogative request for a promise into a declarative statement beginning with \"I wish...\". This makes the philosopher's underlying desire for her commitment explicit in the form of a wish, rather than being an implication within a direct question. This re-writes the illocutionary force from a challenge or demand to a softer expression of hope."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: CINQUIEME SOIR.

The English translation \"it is almost beyond Arithmetick\" makes this implication explicit by stating the reason: the sheer magnitude of the distance challenges the limits of arithmetic or comprehension, thus clarifying the implied difficulty or futility of calculation.","The French \"elles nous la renvoyassent à cette même distance\" (they would send it back to us at this same distance) describes the hypothetical return of light over the same path as part of the reflection process. The English translation \"for it comes back again as far to us;\" makes explicit the underlying reasoning for the doubled effective distance by stating the return journey of light as a factual mechanism. This spells out the implied physics of reflection and light travel more directly.","The French \"& fait deux fois cinquante millions de lieuë\" (and [light] having travelled two times fifty million leagues) presents a multiplication concerning the distance light would travel. The English translation \"so that forwards and backwards, here are an hundred millions of leagues for it to pass\" makes this explicit by: (a) explaining the rationale for the doubling (\"forwards and backwards\"), which was implied by the context of reflection, and (b) providing the calculated result (\"an hundred millions of leagues\"). This expands the condensed mathematical expression and clarifies the total path length for the reflected light.","The French \"Les voilà donc lumineuses par elles-mêmes\" (So there they are, luminous by themselves) states a conclusion about the inherent state of the stars. The English translation, referring to the light of a fixed star, states \"which cannot but proceed from it self\". This makes explicit the logical deduction that if the stars' light is not reflected (as argued previously), it must originate from the stars themselves. It clarifies the mechanism of self-luminosity (light originating from the object) as the direct consequence of the preceding argument, spelling out the connection more directly than the French statement about the stars' state."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P087: Ne me trompay-je point, s'écria la Marquise, ou si je vois où vous me voulez mener?

The English translation \"I protest it is dreadful.\" makes explicit the *speech act* of expressing these feelings by adding \"I protest,\" which frames the Marquise's utterance as a more formal or forceful declaration of her dismay, a nuance not explicitly stated in the French.","The English translation adds \"Madam,\" an explicit term of address. This makes explicit the formal social relationship and polite discourse between the philosopher and the Marquise, which is implied by the context and social norms of the 17th century but not verbally specified at this point in the French dialogue.","The French \"je m'y sentois comme oppressé;\" (I felt oppressed in it) describes a general feeling.

The English \"we scarce know where we are\" translates this into an explicit statement of existential disorientation experienced by \"we our selves,\" a consequence that was only implied in the original by the difficulty of being distinguished.","The French \"se donne tant de peine\" (gives oneself so much trouble/effort) is translated to \"always troubling and harassing our selves\". The English translation explicitly details the nature of the \"peine\" (trouble/effort) as active \"troubling and harassing,\" making the self-inflicted negative aspect more vivid and explicit than the general \"se donner de la peine.\"","The French \"ma paresse profite de mes nouvelles lumieres\" (my laziness profits/benefits from my new insights) is rendered as \"my new lights will in part justifie my laziness.\" The verb \"profite\" (profits/benefits) is interpreted and made explicit as \"justifie\" (justify), clarifying that the new insights provide a rationale or excuse for her laziness, a specific mechanism of benefit that was only implied in the general term \"profite.\"","The French rhetorical question \"(comment une verité eût-elle échappé à Aristote?)\" (how could a truth have escaped Aristotle?) implies Aristotle's vast knowledge. The English translation \"(from whom no truth could be long conceal'd)\" makes this implication an explicit affirmative statement about Aristotle's capability to know truths, removing the interrogative and speculative nuance and directly stating what was implied.","The French \"qui eût êté au despoir\" (who would have been in despair) is translated as \"he might run mad with despair.\" The English translation intensifies \"despair\" by adding \"run mad with,\" explicitly detailing an extreme psychological consequence (madness) of the despair, a level of intensity that was only implied by the context in the source.","The French \"c'eût eté faire trop mal sa Cour que de luy en parler.\" (it would have been to curry favor very poorly to speak to him of it) uses an idiomatic expression implying a foolish action. The English translation \"a Man would have been a great Fool, to have said any thing of 'em to Alexander;\" explicitly states the negative judgment of such a person as \"a great Fool,\" making the implied characterization of the actor explicit.","The French text refers generally to \"Alexandre\" (Alexander) within the anecdote. The English translation, when referring to Alexander in the same context, uses the phrase \"that ambitious Prince.\" While Alexander's ambition is historically known and contextually implied by his narrated reactions, the translator makes this defining trait explicit by adding the descriptive epithet, directly linking his character to the reason for discretion.","The French \"tirer d'utilité de la connoissance que j'en ay.\" (to draw utility/benefit from the knowledge I have of it) uses \"utilité\" (utility/benefit) as a general term. The English translation \"not one jot the wiser for all the knowledge I have of 'em;\" specifies the *type* of utility as intellectual gain or wisdom (\"wiser\"), making explicit the particular kind of benefit the philosopher might have expected, which was only implied in the broader term \"utilité.\"","The French \"l'inquietude\" (restlessness, anxiety, worry) is translated as \"their unquiet restless humour.\" The English translation expands the single noun into a more descriptive phrase, explicitly detailing the nature of the \"inquietude\" as an \"unquiet restless humour.\" This elaboration makes the psychological state more vivid and specific, potentially adding a period-specific nuance with \"humour,\" which was less detailed in the single French word.","The French \"Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau\" (A little weakness for what is beautiful) is translated as \"I confess, I am guilty of so much weakness, as to be in love with what is beautiful\". The English version expands \"Un peu de foiblesse\" into a more emphatic admission (\"I confess, I am guilty of so much weakness\") and explicitly defines the \"foiblesse pour\" (weakness for) as \"to be in love with,\" specifying the nature and intensity of the feeling as romantic love, which was more general and understated in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P091: Cela est hors de doute, répondis-je.

The general term \"tout\" (everything) is specified as \"any other light,\" clarifying the objects being obscured. Furthermore, the verb \"efface\" (erases/blots out) is elaborated with the descriptive phrase \"darkens and hinders us from seeing,\" which explains the mechanism of obscuration, making the implicit process explicit.","The single French verb \"domine\" (dominates/prevails, from \"un autre Soleil qui y domine\") is rendered by the English verbal phrase \"rules and governs.\" This expansion into a doublet clarifies the nature of the Sun's powerful influence within its vortex by specifying distinct but related actions, making the implied aspects of its dominance explicit.","The French possessive pronoun \"le nôtre\" (ours), which refers implicitly to \"notre Soleil\" (our Sun) from the context of \"il efface à son tour le nôtre,\" is explicitated in the translation as \"the light of our Sun.\" This specification, similar to the first instance, clarifies that it is particularly the Sun's light that is affected, making explicit an aspect that was only implied by the pronoun.","The French object pronoun \"l'\" (it), referring to \"notre [Soleil]\" (our Sun) from the preceding context in the phrase \"On l'attache avec elles,\" is replaced by its explicit referent \"our Sun\" in the translation \"with them our Sun is fastned.\" This directly resolves the pronominal reference within the text, making the subject explicitly clear whereas it was pronominally implied in the source.","The French phrase \"leur Monde\" (their World), from \"Dans leur Monde,\" is translated as \"his own World or Sphere.\" The addition of \"or Sphere\" explicitates a key concept from Cartesian cosmology, which Fontenelle is popularizing. In this context, \"Monde\" often refers to a Cartesian vortex, conceived as a spherical system. The term \"Sphere\" makes this specific scientific interpretation explicit, which was only implied by the more general term \"Monde.\"","The French phrase \"ils sont uniques en leur espece\" (they are unique in their kind/species) is translated and expanded to \"every Sun is single, and there is but one to be seen.\" This expansion clarifies the meaning of \"uniques en leur espece\" in this astronomical context by explaining *how* each Sun is unique within its system – specifically, by being the sole, visible dominant star. The original implies this uniqueness, while the translation spells out its manifestation.","The French term \"cette égalité\" (this equality/similarity) is translated as \"this great resemblance between 'em.\" The word \"égalité\" implies a comparison or relation. The addition of \"between 'em\" makes this relational aspect (a resemblance *between* the worlds or suns) explicit. The intensifier \"great\" also adds a degree of emphasis not strictly present in \"égalité.\"","The French phrase \"un fond de ressemblance\" (a basis/foundation of resemblance) is interpreted and rephrased in the translation as \"tho' they may be alike in one particular.\" The abstract term \"fond\" (basis, foundation) is made more concrete by specifying that the resemblance lies \"in one particular\" aspect. This offers a specific interpretation of the nature of the underlying similarity, making explicit a possible way to understand this \"fond\" from which infinite differences can then arise."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">de deviner</span></span>.

The English translation 'to know wherein they differ' explicitly states this implied object, clarifying that the difficulty lies in discerning the specific ways the vortices vary.","The French 'Planetes subalternes' (subordinate planets) primarily refers to planets of a lower hierarchical order (like moons orbiting larger planets). The English translation 'inferiour or less Planets' makes explicit an often-associated but not inherent characteristic: 'less' likely refers to lesser size, which is typical of subordinate celestial bodies but not directly stated by 'subalternes'. This adds a clarifying physical attribute.","The French 'un petit peloton' can mean a small, dense cluster or ball, or a small group like a platoon. The English translation 'a little Squadron' makes explicit a specific interpretation of 'peloton' by choosing a term that denotes a formally organized, often military, group. This specifies the nature of the planetary grouping as an ordered formation, which was only one possible implication of 'peloton'.","The French 'l'équilibre' refers to 'the equilibrium' or 'the balance' in a general sense.

The addition of 'Madam' makes the addressee of the philosopher's speech (the Marquise) explicit within the reporting clause, a detail implied by the overall dialogic context but not specified in the source phrase.","The French 'ce qui n'en a point' (that which has no [answers]) is translated as 'Objections which are unanswerable.' The word 'Objections' explicitly defines the nature of 'that which' as a formal point of contention or difficulty, rather than a more general unanswerable thing or question implied by the source.","The French 'six faces plates' (six flat faces) is translated as 'six squares or flat faces.' The addition of 'squares or' explicitly clarifies the typical geometric shape (square) of a die's faces, information which is implied by the earlier mention of 'Dé' (die) but not spelled out in the adjectival description 'plates' (flat) itself.","The French 'si les facetes étoient fort petites' (if the facets were very small) is expanded to 'if the facets be very many and little.' The addition of 'very many' makes explicit the implied condition that a large quantity of such small facets is necessary to achieve the described effect of roundness, a quantitative aspect not directly stated in the source.","The French 'appuyez sur deux faces voisines' (supported on/leaning on two neighboring faces) is translated as 'supported by the two next flats on which they stand.' The phrase 'on which they stand' explicitly clarifies the functional role and stable positioning of the vortices relative to these faces/flats, which was more implicitly conveyed by 'appuyez sur'.","The French 'la Nature qui ménage bien le terrain' (Nature who manages space/resources well or is thrifty with space) is translated as 'Nature, who is an excellent Huswife, and suffers nothing to be useless.' The addition of the clause 'and suffers nothing to be useless' explicitly states the underlying principle or motivation for Nature's efficiency (her abhorrence of waste), which is implied by the idiomatic 'ménage bien le terrain' but not directly articulated.","The French 'qui fussent demeurez inutiles' (which would have remained useless) is translated as 'which otherwise would have been void and useless.' The addition of 'void and' explicitly clarifies that these 'corners of the Universe' were characterized by emptiness in addition to their uselessness, an attribute not directly stated in the source.","The French 'fort contents d'eux-mêmes' (very content with themselves) is translated as 'well satisfy'd with their being where they are.' The target text explicitly clarifies that their contentment relates to their specific situation or location ('their being where they are'), an aspect that is contextually implied but not directly spelled out by the more general reflexive pronoun 'd'eux-mêmes'.","The French 'Lunettes d'approche' (literally 'approach glasses,' a general term for spyglasses or small telescopes) is translated as 'a Tellescope.' The target text uses a more specific term ('Tellescope') that strongly denotes the scientific instrument for astronomical observation, thereby making explicit the precise nature of the tool implied by the context of discovering 'petits Soleils' (little Suns).","The French 'Ballon' (a general term for 'ball') is translated and significantly expanded to 'Foot-ball, made of a Bladder, cover'd with Leather.' This explicitation specifies not only a particular type of ball likely familiar to English readers of the period ('Foot-ball') but also adds concrete details of its construction ('made of a Bladder, cover'd with Leather'). This added descriptive information, absent in the source, serves to make Fontenelle's analogy more vivid and grounded in a tangible object for the target audience.","The French 'ne paroissent briller à reprises' (appear to shine intermittently or in bursts) is translated as 'sometimes seem not to shine at all.' The target text makes the 'off' phase of the intermittent shining explicitly a complete cessation of light ('not to shine at all'), which is a more defined and arguably stronger interpretation of the flickering phenomenon than the source's 'à reprises'.","The French 'poussent perpetuellement le nôtre' (perpetually push ours), referring to the action of vortices, is translated as 'perpetually push and press our Vortex.' The addition of 'and press' to 'push' elaborates on the nature of the force exerted, suggesting a more comprehensive, sustained, or constricting action than 'push' alone might convey, thus making the interaction more dynamically explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

The translation to 'Foot-balls' specifies a concrete type of ball known to the English reader of the period (often an inflated bladder), thereby making the image more explicit and relatable, clarifying the kind of pliable, spherical object Fontenelle might be alluding to in his popularization.","The French 'se combattent' (fight/combat each other) is a general term for conflict. The translation 'striving and pushing one another' explicates the nature of this combat, detailing it as a more physical, mechanical interaction involving effort ('striving') and physical contact ('pushing'), which might have been only implied by the more general 'se combattent' in the context of interacting celestial bodies or vortices.","The French 'ce combat' (this combat) refers to the previously mentioned interaction between worlds. The translation 'this justling' specifies a particular kind of physical conflict involving agitated, repeated pushing or bumping. This makes the nature of the 'combat' more explicit and concrete, aligning with the earlier explicitation of 'se combattent' as 'striving and pushing'.","The French 'le seul' (the only one), in the phrase 'le seul qu'ils puissent avoir' (the only one they can have), refers back to 'un commerce de lumière' (a trade/commerce of light). The translation 'the only correspondence' explicitly adds the noun 'correspondence,' clarifying that this 'trade of light' is to be understood as their sole means of interaction or communication. This spells out a specific interpretation of 'commerce' that was only implied in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P099: Non, non, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">ce n'est pas le seul.</span></span> Les Mondes voisins nous envoyent quelquefois visiter, &amp; même assez magnifiquement. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">Il nous en vient des Cometes</span></span>, qui sont toûjours ornées, ou d'une chevelure éclatante, ou d'une barbe venerable, ou d'une queüe majestueuse. </p><p>P100: Ah! quels Deputez dit-elle en riant!

(it is not the only one.) implicitly refers to a previously discussed mode of interaction between worlds. The translation 'Light is not their sole commerce;' makes this referent explicit by identifying 'Light' as the primary or other form of 'commerce', clarifying the philosopher's statement that cometary visits are another distinct form of interaction.","The French pronoun 'en' in 'Il nous en vient des Cometes' (Comets come to us from there/of them) implicitly refers to 'Les Mondes voisins' (Neighbouring Worlds) mentioned in the preceding sentence. The translation 'There come Comets to us from thence' makes this origin explicit by adding 'from thence,' clearly indicating that the comets originate from these other worlds.","The French 'mais les enfants sont en grand nombre.' (but children are in great number / there are many children [who are scared]) is a general statement. The translation 'but indeed, the number of such Children is now a days very great.' adds the phrase 'now a days,' explicitly situating the prevalence of people easily frightened by comets within the translator's contemporary period, an emphasis not explicitly present in the original.","The French 'ceux qui l'environnent' (those which surround it) uses the general pronoun 'ceux' (those). Fontenelle is explaining Descartes' vortex theory ('Tourbillon'). The translation 'those Vortex's which encompass it' explicitly identifies these surrounding entities as 'Vortex's,' clarifying that 'ceux' refers to other Cartesian vortices, a specific concept central to the scientific theory being popularized.","The French 'sont-elles toûjours fort élevées à notre égard' translates to 'are always very high with respect to us' or 'from our perspective.' The phrase 'à notre égard' implies that this height is relative to an observer's viewpoint. The translation 'They appear to us very high' makes this perceptual aspect explicit by using the verb 'appear,' shifting the description from a statement of relative position to one of visual perception by an observer.","The French 'Il est nécessaire dans nôtre Sistême,' (It is necessary in our System,) introduces a requirement of the Cartesian system (which is the existence of a void space, detailed immediately after in the source). The English translation prefaces the subsequent description of the void space with the clause 'and according to our System, it is absolutely necessary they [the comets] should be so high,'. This addition explicitly states that the comets' high trajectory is a direct and absolute necessity dictated by the 'System,' spelling out a specific consequence for the comets' behavior that the original links more generally to the system's need for the void.","The French 'Nos Ennemis nous reprochent sans cesse inutilité de ce grand espace.' (Our Enemies unceasingly reproach us for the uselessness of this large space.) describes a direct accusation. The English translation 'Our Adversaries often ask us, to what purpose this void space serves?' rephrases this accusation as an explicit question about the space's purpose. This spells out the interrogative form of the challenge (questioning its utility) which is implied by the 'reproach of uselessness' in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P101: J'entends, dit-elle..

The English translation \"among our own Planets\" clarifies this by explicitly positioning this phrase as describing a state of co-location or mingling with the planets from which the comets are also barred. It makes explicit that being 'with our planets' is part of the prohibited access, resolving a potential syntactic ambiguity. The addition of \"own\" further specifies \"our planets\" in contrast to the comets.","The French \"Il ne leur fait pas l'honneur de les loger à Constantinople\" (He does not do them the honor of lodging them in Constantinople) concisely links the denial of honor with the act of not lodging them. The English translation \"he will not shew them so much respect as to let 'em Lodge in Constantinople\" unpacks this by explicitly stating the (insufficient) degree of 'respect' and its direct consequence ('as to let 'em lodge'). This spells out the causal relationship between the lack of esteem and the denial of permission for lodging, which is more integrated and implied in the French idiomatic expression.","The French \"sans en renvoyer\" (without sending any back/in return) indicates a non-action regarding the sending of ambassadors. The English translation \"but never send any\" makes the totality and habitual nature of this non-action explicit by using the adverb \"never\". This adds a stronger and more absolute temporal dimension, emphasizing that this is an unbroken rule, an aspect that is implied but less forcefully asserted by the French \"sans\".","The French \"ne renvoyons point de nos Planetes\" (we do not send any of our planets at all) is a strong negation. The English translation \"never send any of our Planets\" makes the temporal scope and permanence of this negation explicit by using \"never\". This emphasizes that the non-sending of planets is an absolute and unchanging rule, akin to a natural law, rather than just a general or current negation. The French \"ne...point\" is a strong negation but does not inherently carry the same explicit emphasis on all-time universality as \"never\"."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P102: A en juger par toutes ces choses là, répliqua-t-elle,. nous sommes bien fiers.

While 'air' can denote a general appearance or look, the choice of 'Countenance' in English, particularly in context with the planets described as having 'Tails and their Beards', makes more explicit the implied personification. It suggests that these features contribute to a specific, expressive, and imposing aspect akin to a face or a distinct demeanor, rather than just a vague 'air'. The translator clarifies the nature of the 'menacing air' by rendering it as a more defined 'Countenance'.","The French 'se faire craindre' (literally 'to make oneself feared', or more broadly 'to inspire fear') is translated as 'to make people afraid'. The French reflexive construction implies that an entity (or entities) would be made to experience fear, but it does not explicitly state who these entities are, leaving it to the reader to infer (likely observers or inhabitants of other worlds).

The translator has explicitly added \"Madam,\" making the philosopher's direct address to the Marquise clear in this specific utterance, which was implicit in the concise French phrase within the ongoing dialogue.","The French \"ne sont que de pures apparences.\" (are only pure appearances.) is translated and expanded to \"they are Phaenomena, and but meer Appearances.\" The translator makes the nature of these 'appearances' more explicit by adding the learned term \"Phaenomena,\" which classifies them in a scientific/philosophical manner not explicitly stated by the simpler French \"pures apparences.\"","The French \"on la devinera quand on pourra.\" (one will figure it out/guess it when one can.) is impersonal and refers to a general future discovery. The translation \"and when I am able I will tell you how 'tis done.\" personalizes this, explicitly re-framing the future explanation as a direct promise from the philosopher-narrator to the Marquise, which was not stated in the original.","The French \"y répandre l'effroy\" (to spread fright there) is general about the effect. The translation \"and affright all the Inhabitants of it.\" makes explicit who would be frightened by specifying \"all the Inhabitants of it.\" While one might infer inhabitants from the context, the target text spells this out directly, adding clarifying information.","The French \"le choc\" (the shock) is a relatively neutral term. The translation \"how rude and violent the Shock is\" explicitly elaborates on the nature of the shock by adding the descriptive adjectives \"rude and violent,\" thereby intensifying the description and making an implied severity explicit.","The French \"annoncent aux autres par avance\" (announce to the others in advance) uses the general term \"aux autres\" (to the others). The translation \"would tell their Neighbours beforehand\" makes this group more specific by rendering it as \"their Neighbours,\" explicitly defining a closer, community-based relationship among the comet inhabitants.","The French \"disent-ils peut-être en parlant de Saturne.\" (they say perhaps, speaking of Saturn.) suggests the comet inhabitants themselves might make the connection to Saturn explicit in their speech. The translation \"meaning our Saturn,\" shifts this into an explicit explanatory gloss from the narrator to the Marquise (and reader), directly stating the referent rather than it being a speculated part of the comet dwellers' own words.","The French \"quatre petites qui la suivent.\" (four little ones that follow it.) describes a neutral action of following. The translation \"four little ones to wait on it;\" explicitly interprets this \"following\" as an act of attendance or service (\"to wait on\"), thereby adding an anthropomorphic layer to the relationship between the planet and its moons that was only implicitly suggested by the original phrasing."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P104: Il ne faut donc plus songer, luy dis-je, à vous donner de la pitié pour les Habitans d'une Comète, mais j'espère du moins que vous plaindrez ceux qui vivent dans un Tourbillon dont le Soleil vient à s'éteindre, &amp; qui demeurent dans une nuit éternelle. Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles Fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumière; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; car que faire sans Soleil? Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? Je vous diray, si vous voulez, répondis je, ce que disent <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">de fort habiles Gens</span></span>, que les Etoiles Fixes qui ont disparu ne sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est-à-dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">comme ils tournent sur eux-mêmes</span></span>, tantôt ils nous présentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantôt la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion-là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">des temps reglez</span></span> pour paroître &amp; pour disparoître, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">de tourner sur elles-mêmes</span></span>? Vous êtes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur. Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles Fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantôt plus grandes tantôt plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus légers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur. Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement, des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoîtroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoître de longtemps. Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">selon Descartes</span></span>, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on.</span></span> Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Les Anciens êtaient plaisants</span></span> de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">encore laissé</span></span> à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, il faut que l'espce se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, répliquai-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au-delà, il faudroit être plus habile que je ne suis.

How? cry'd the Countess, can Suns be put out? Yes, without doubt said I, for People some thousand years ago saw fix'd Stars in the Sky, which are now no more to be seen; these were Suns which have lost their Light, and certainly there must be strange Desolation in their Vortex's, and a general Mortality over all the Planets, for what can People do without a Sun? This is a dismal Fancy, said the Countess, I would not if I could help it, let it come into my head. I will tell you if you please, I reply'd, what in this particular is the Opinion of Learned Astronomers. They think that the fix'd Stars which have disappear'd, are not quite extinguish'd, but that they are half Suns, that is, they have one half Dark, and the other half Light, and turning round upon their own Axis or Centre, they sometimes shew us their Light side, and afterwards turning to us their Dark side, we see them no more. To oblige you Madam, I will be of this Opinion, because it is not so harsh as the other, but I cannot make it good, but in relation to some certain Stars, because as some have lately observed, those Stars have their Regulated times of appearing, and disappearing, otherwise there could be no such thing as half Suns. But what shall we say of Stars, which totally disappear, and never shew themselves again after they have finish'd their Course of turning round upon their own Axis? you are too just Madam to oblige me to believe that such Stars are half Suns. However I will try once more what I can do in favour of your Opinion; the Suns are not extinct, they are only sunk so low into the immense depth of Heaven, that we cannot possibly see them, in this Case the Vortex follows his Sun and all's well again. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fix'd Stars have not this motion, by which they remove themselves so far from us, because at other times they might return again nearer to us, and we should see them sometimes greater, and sometimes less, which never happens. But we will suppose that none but the Little, Light, and most Active Vortex's which slip between the others make certain voyages, after which they return again, while the main body of Vortex's remain unmov'd. 'Tis likewise very strange that some fix'd Stars shew themselves to us, spending a great deal of time in appearing, and disappearing, and at last, totally and entirely disappear. Half Suns would appear again at their set and regulated time. Now Madam, boldly declare your Opinion; Must not these Stars of necessity be Suns which are so much darkned as not to be visible to us, yet afterwards shine again, and at last are wholly extinct? How can a Sun said the Countess, be darkned, and quite extinguish'd, when it is in its own Nature a Fountain of Light? It may be done Madam, said I, with all the ease in the world, if Desc�rtes Opinion be true, that our Sun hath Spots; now whether these Spots be Scum or thick Mists, or what you please, they may thicken and unite, till at last they cover the Sun with a Crust, which daily grows thicker, and then Farewell Sun. We have hitherto scap'd pretty well; but 'tis said, that the Sun for some whole years together hath look'd very pale; for Example, the year after Caesar's death; it was this Crust that then began to grow, but the force of the Sun broke and dissipated it; had it continued, we had been all lost People. You make me tremble, reply'd the Countess; and now I know the fatal consequences of the Sun's paleness, I believe, instead of going every morning to my Glass, to see how I look, I shall cast my Eyes up to Heaven, to see whether or no the Sun looks pale. Oh, Madam, said I, there is a great deal of time required to ruine a World. Grant it, said she, yet 'tis but time that is required. I confess it, said I; all this immense mass of Matter that composes the Universe, is in perpetual motion, no part of it excepted; and since every part is moved, you may be sure that changes must happen sooner or later; but still in times proportioned to the Effect. The Ancients were pleasant Gentlemen, to imagine that the celestial Bodies were in their own nature unchangeable, because they observed no change in them; but they did not live long enough to confirm their opinion by their own experience; they were Boys in comparison of us. Give me leave, Madam, to explain my self by an Allegory: If Roses, which last but a day, could write Histories, and leave Memoirs one to another; and if the first Rose should draw an exact Picture of their Gardiner, and after fifteen thousand Rose-Ages, it should be left to other Roses, and so left still to those that should succeed, without any change in it; should the Roses hereupon say, we have every day seen the same Gardiner, and in the memory of Roses, none ever saw any Gardiner but this; he is still the same he was, and therefore certainly he will never die, as we do; for there is no change at all in him. Would not these Roses, Madam, talk very foolishly? and yet there would be more reason in their discourse, than there was in what the Ancients said concerning celestial Bodies; and tho' even to this very day there should appear no visible change in the Heavens, and the matter of which they are made, should have all the signs of an eternal duration without any change; yet I would not believe 'em unchangeable, till I had the experience of many more Ages. Ought we, who last but a moment, make our continuance the measure of any other things duration; 'tis not so easie a matter to be eternal. To have lasted many Ages of Men, one after another, is no sign of Immortality. Truly, says the Countess, I find the Worlds are far from being able to pretend to it; I will not do 'em so much honour, as to ompare 'em to the Gardiner that lived so much longer than the Roses: I begin to think 'em like the Roses themselves, which blow one day, and die the next: For now I understand, that if old Stars disappear, new ones will come in their room, because every species must preserve it self. No species, Madam, said I, can totally perish; some perhaps will tell you, that such new Stars are Suns, which return to our sight again, after they have been a long time hid from us, in the profundity of Heaven: Others may tell you, they are Suns cleared from that thick crust, which once covered them: If I should think all this possible, yet I likewise believe that the Universe may be framed in such a manner, that from time to time it may produce new Suns; why may not that matter which is proper to make a Sun, be dispers'd here and there, and gather it self again at long run, into one certain place, and lay the foundation of a new World? I am very much inclin'd to believe such new productions, because they suit with that glorious and admirable Idea which I have of the works of Nature. Can we think that wise Nature knows no more than the secret of making Herbs and Plants live and die by a continual revolution? I am verily perswaded, and are not you so too, Madam? that Nature, without much cost or pains can put the same secret in practice, upon the Worlds. I now find, says the Countess, the Worlds, the Heaven, and celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am come to my self again. To come the better again to our selves, I reply'd, let us say no more of these Matters. We are arrived at the very roof and top of all the Heavens; and to tell you whether there be any Stars beyond it, you must have an abler Man than I am; you may place Worlds there, or no Worlds, as you please: 'Tis the Philosopher's Empire to describe those vast invisible Countries, which are, and are not, or are such as he pleases to make 'em: It is enough for me, to have carried your mind as far as you can see with your Eyes.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P083: You have no reason then, said I, to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, yet I suppose you will think their Condition lamentable, who inhabit a Vortex whose Sun comes in time to be quite extinguished, and consequently live in Eternal Night.

Truly, says the Countess, I find the Worlds are far from being able to pretend to it; I will not do 'em so much honour, as to ompare 'em to the Gardiner that lived so much longer than the Roses: I begin to think 'em like the Roses themselves, which blow one day, and die the next: For now I understand, that if old Stars disappear, new ones will come in their room, because every species must preserve it self. No species, Madam, said I, can totally perish; some perhaps will tell you, that such new Stars are Suns, which return to our sight again, after they have been a long time hid from us, in the profundity of Heaven: Others may tell you, they are Suns cleared from that thick crust, which once covered them: If I should think all this possible, yet I likewise believe that the Universe may be framed in such a manner, that from time to time it may produce new Suns; why may not that matter which is proper to make a Sun, be dispers'd here and there, and gather it self again at long run, into one certain place, and lay the foundation of a new World? I am very much inclin'd to believe such new productions, because they suit with that glorious and admirable Idea which I have of the works of Nature. Can we think that wise Nature knows no more than the secret of making Herbs and Plants live and die by a continual revolution? I am verily perswaded, and are not you so too, Madam? that Nature, without much cost or pains can put the same secret in practice, upon the Worlds. I now find, says the Countess, the Worlds, the Heaven, and celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am come to my self again. To come the better again to our selves, I reply'd, let us say no more of these Matters. We are arrived at the very roof and top of all the Heavens; and to tell you whether there be any Stars beyond it, you must have an abler Man than I am; you may place Worlds there, or no Worlds, as you please: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">'Tis the Philosopher's Empire to describe those vast invisible Countries, which are, and are not, or are such as he pleases to make 'em</span></span>: It is enough for me, to have carried your mind as far as you can see with your Eyes.</p>","explanations":["The general French \"de fort habiles Gens\" (very skilled people) is made more specific in English as \"Learned Astronomers,\" explicitly identifying these individuals by their relevant field of expertise (astronomy), thereby adding clarifying information about their authority on the matter.","The French \"tournent sur eux-mêmes\" (turn on themselves), a common description of rotation, is rendered more scientifically explicit in English by the addition of \"upon their own Axis or Centre,\" spelling out the precise astronomical mechanism.","The French phrase \"de tourner sur elles-mêmes\" (of turning on themselves), found within a longer clause about stars completing their rotation, is translated with added scientific precision as \"of turning round upon their own Axis.\" This explicitates the nature of the rotation by introducing the astronomical term \"Axis,\" making the mechanism clearer for the reader.","The French \"des temps reglez\" (regulated times) is expanded to \"their set and regulated time\" in the English translation. The addition of \"set\" alongside \"regulated\" explicitly reinforces and spells out the idea of fixed, predetermined, and predictable intervals for the stars' appearance and disappearance.","The direct French assertion \"selon Descartes\" (according to Descartes) is transformed into the more cautious and evaluative phrase \"if Desc�rtes Opinion be true,\". This explicitly frames Descartes's subsequent statement as an \"Opinion\" rather than an undisputed fact, and makes its acceptance conditional, possibly reflecting the changing scientific landscape and a desire to present such theories less dogmatically.","The French \"Les Anciens êtaient plaisants\" (The Ancients were amusing/pleasant) is translated as \"The Ancients were pleasant Gentlemen.\" The addition of \"Gentlemen\" explicitly assigns a social descriptor to \"The Ancients,\" adding a layer of characterization or conventional address for learned figures of the past that is not literally present in the source.","The French \"encore laissé\" (again left / also left), found in the clause \"les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre\" implying the continuation of an action of leaving memoirs, is translated as \"and so left still\" in the corresponding English clause \"it should be left to other Roses, and so left still to those that should succeed\". The additions of \"so\" (implying consequence or manner) and \"still\" (emphasizing continuity and unchanged state) explicitly spell out the sequential nature of the transmission and the enduring, unaltered state of the record passed down through generations.","The French \"C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent être ou n'être pas si on veut, ou être tels que l'on veut\" (It is properly the Empire of Philosophers that these great invisible countries are...) presents the invisible countries as constituting the philosophers' empire. The English translation \"'Tis the Philosopher's Empire to describe those vast invisible Countries, which are, and are not, or are such as he pleases to make 'em\" rephrases this by explicitly inserting the verb \"to describe,\" thereby clarifying that the philosophers' dominion or role (\"Empire\") over these conceptual territories involves the act of defining, imagining, or characterizing them.","The concise French \"Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on.\" (We have already even escaped it, it is said/they say), where \"it\" refers to the sun being covered by a crust, is significantly expanded and rephrased. The target \"We have hitherto scap'd pretty well;\" elaborates on the escape. Furthermore, the phrase \"but 'tis said, that the Sun for some whole years together hath look'd very pale;\" re-assigns and expands \"dit-on\" to explicitly introduce the observation of the sun's paleness as the content of the report, whereas the French \"dit-on\" more directly modifies the act of having escaped the danger. This rewriting makes explicit what was reportedly observed as evidence of the averted crisis."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">elle</span></span>, j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">Je suis savante!</span></span> Oüy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">répliquay-je</span></span>, vous l'êtes assez raisonnablement, &amp; vous l'êtes avec la commodité de pouvoir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">ne rien croire</span></span> de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Je vous demande seulement pour recompense</span></span> de mes peines de ne voir jamais le Soleil, ny le Ciel, ny les Etoiles, sans songer à moy.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P084: Well, says the Countess, I have now in my Head, the System of the Universe: How learned am I become?

The English translation renders 's'écria-t-elle' as 'says the Countess', replacing the pronoun 'elle' with 'the Countess'. This explicitly states her title (as used consistently in this translation), providing more specific identifying information than the general pronoun, thereby making the speaker's identity explicit within the dialogue tag rather than relying solely on anaphora.","The French exclamation 'Je suis savante!' (I am learned!) declares a present state of knowledge. The English translation 'How learned am I become?' rephrases this to emphasize the process of *achieving* this state. This explicitation highlights the transformative effect of the preceding dialogues, a nuance of change or development that, while inferable from the context of her learning, is made explicit in the English verb 'become'.","The French reporting clause 'répliquay-je' (I replied) does not include a direct term of address. The English translation 'Madam, said I' adds the vocative 'Madam.' This makes the polite and formal direct address to the Countess explicit within the reporting clause, a formality implied by the general context and use of 'vous' (you, formal) in the broader dialogue but not explicitly present in the French reporting verb phrase itself.","The French phrase 'ne rien croire' (to believe nothing), from 'de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit' (the ability to believe nothing of all I told you), primarily emphasizes the freedom to disbelieve. The English translation 'believing, or not believing' expands this by explicitly and symmetrically spelling out both alternatives of the choice (to believe, or not to believe), making the binary nature of her intellectual freedom more patent.","The French phrase 'Je vous demande seulement pour recompense' (I ask you only as reward/recompense) frames the philosopher's request in terms of seeking a recompense for his efforts. The English translation 'I only beg this favour' recharacterizes this act by explicitly naming the nature of the request itself as 'this favour.' While a polite request for recompense might be understood implicitly as asking for a favour, the English text makes this interpretation explicit, potentially adding a nuance about the social dynamics of the request."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: FIN</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P085: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P085: FINIS.</p>","explanations":[]}],"counts":{"manual":12,"ai":469}}
