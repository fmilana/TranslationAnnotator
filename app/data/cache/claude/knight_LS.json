Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement.</span></span> La Lune estoit levée il y avoit Page 8] peut-estre une heure, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">&amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir.</span></span> Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moyndre Etoile; elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée. Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle? Helas, repliquay-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.</span></span> Et bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la-moy, je croiray sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit.</span></span> Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, repliquay-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse. Cherchez ailleurs des Philosophes </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day. I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self. Well, says she, since your Folly is so delightful, pray let me have a share in it, I'l believe what you please of the Stars, provided I find pleasure in it. Ah! Madam, said I, 'tis not a pleasure like that which you find in a Comedy of Moliere; 'tis a pleasure, I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind. And pray, says she, do you think me incapable of pleasures that are only in the Reason; bring me acquainted with your Stars, and you shall presently see the contrary. No, said I, it shall never be laid to my charge, that in a Grove, at ten of clock at night, I entertain'd the most lovely person in the World with nothing but Philosophy, look out for such Philosophers elsewhere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it.</span></span> The Moon was about an hour high, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black;</span></span> not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars.</span></span> Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night?

The English translation simplifies this by removing the address and using more straightforward language with less formality.","The French text uses more intensive and vivid descriptive language with 'un blanc fort vif' (a very bright white), while the English translation simplifies this to 'a lively white', reducing some of the vividness of the original description.","The English translation simplifies the more poetic and contemplative French expression 'Ce spectacle me fit resver' to the more straightforward 'The prospect set me a musing', making the language more accessible but less evocative.","The French original uses more poetic phrasing with 'm'abandonner à la Lune & aux Etoiles' (abandon myself to the Moon and Stars), while the English simplifies this to 'withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars', losing some of the romantic quality of the original.","The translator has simplified several elements of this passage, including the more playful and whimsical expression 'Je me suis mis dans la teste' to the more direct 'I have had a fancy' and the poetic 'une maniere riante' to simply 'with delight'. The philosophical reflection about truth and pleasantness is also rendered in more straightforward language.","The translator simplifies the French expression 'je ne sçay où dans la raison, & qui ne fait rire que l'esprit' by rendering it as 'I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind'.

Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne sçavois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle qui ne sçavoit rien en matiere de Phisique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit estre une Planete; &amp; les Planetes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des Mondes. J'en revenois toûjours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en nostre place.</span></span> A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes; &amp; si d'un autre costé vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le sçavoir, ce qui reviendrait au mesme.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Mais on veut sçavoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est-là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera. Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiete d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien, qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyoient le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent, qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé.</span></span> L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; &amp; cent autres resveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">&amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera.</span></span> A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique? Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties. Avoüez la verité. N'avez-vous point eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne meritoit? J'ay vû des gens qui l'en estimoyent moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoyent connu. Et moy, repliqua-t-elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sçay qu'il ressemble à une Montre. Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples. </p><p>P005: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Je ne sçay pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en verité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir. Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la teste un faux Merveilleux envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent. Ils n'admirent la Nature que parce qu'ils la croyent une espece de Magie où l'on n'entend rien, &amp; il est seur qu'une chose est deshonorée auprés d'eux, dés qu'elle peut estre conceüe. Mais, Madame, continuay-je, vous estes si bien disposée à entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire, que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, &amp; à vous montrer le Monde.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P003: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret.

Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed:</span></span> One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre.</span></span> By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French text uses more complex sentence structures and formal expressions such as 'J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là' which has been simplified to 'I defended my self in this manner for a time' in the English translation.

J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaist, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient.</span></span> nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe.</span></span> Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoyent esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pieces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin.</span></span> Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvemens qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux.</span></span> Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit?</span></span> C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy,</span></span> and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way?</span></span> Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his.</span></span> 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye.</span></span> Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road.</span></span> All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens.</span></span> And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next?</span></span> 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury.

The English simplifies this to 'Copernicus charges her as near as he can', reducing some of the intentionality suggested in the original.","The French question uses a more formal and philosophical structure.

Also, the complex phrase 'dont il veut se saisir' (which he wants to seize) is simplified to the more straightforward 'endeavours to lay hold on them'.","The rhetorical structure is maintained, but the English translation simplifies the vocabulary and phrasing. The French 'raffinés' carries connotations of sophistication and refinement that are rendered simply as 'refin'd' without elaboration. The translation also streamlines the sentence structure to make it more accessible to an English-speaking audience.","The English translation simplifies the rhetorical questions from the French, which uses a more complex negative interrogative structure.

Were there none but you, Madam, said I, all those that have been address'd to you, are fled thither, and they are enough to make a considerable body. In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it. But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon. They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable. When we go to some Lands newly discover'd, we find the Inhabitants scarce Men; they are a sort of Animals in humane shape, and sometime imperfect enough, but almost wholly without reason: therefore surely he that should go on to the Moon, would not find them Men at all.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P030: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">As for the Sighs of Lovers, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, I know not whether in the days of Ariosto they were lost or not, but now adays I know none that go to the Moon.</span></span> Were there none but you, Madam, said I, all those that have been address'd to you, are fled thither, and they are enough to make a considerable body. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear.</span></span> The thing is, the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it.

Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots.</span></span> Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu.</span></span> Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste.</span></span> D'où sont-ils venus?

If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple.

Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates.

The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order.

Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost un Païs, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mesmes changemens sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voila le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'éleve point de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune.

Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre.

Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes.

The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not. From the moment that we have an interior motion in the parts of the Moon, or produc'd found by foreign causes, the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd, and we have a fund necessary for their subsistance. This will furnish us with Fruit, Corn, Water, and all that we desire. I mean Fruit, Corn and Water, such as are in the Moon; for I profess not to know of what sort they are, all fit for the use of the Inhabitants, whom I know as little.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P036: I have News to tell you, said I.

Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew:</span></span> and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not. From the moment that we have an interior motion in the parts of the Moon, or produc'd found by foreign causes, the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd, and we have a fund necessary for their subsistance. This will furnish us with Fruit, Corn, Water, and all that we desire. I mean Fruit, Corn and Water, such as are in the Moon; for I profess not to know of what sort they are, all fit for the use of the Inhabitants, whom I know as little.</p>","explanations":["The French phrase 'Je ne me paye point de Sentences' uses a figurative expression that has been simplified to 'I'm not to be satisfied' in English, making the statement more direct and easier to understand for English readers.","The translator has simplified the sentence structure while maintaining the meaning.

Toute leur felicité consiste en ce qu'elles y entendent l'Harmonie que les Corps Celestes font par leurs mouvemens; mais comme il pretend que quand la Lune tombe dans l'ombre de la Terre, elles ne peuvent plus entendre cette Harmonie; alors, dit-il, ces Ames crient comme des desesperées, &amp; la Lune se haste le plus qu'elle peut de les tirer d'un endroit si facheux. Nous devrions donc, repliqua-t-elle, voir arriver icy les Bienheureux de la Lune, car apparemment on nous les envoye aussi, &amp; dans ces deux Planetes on croit avoir assez pourveu à la felicité des Ames, de les avoir transportées dans un autre Monde.

For it is good in it self, and in the manner you conceive it, 'tis unanswerable, and there's but little Wit in finding an Answer for what has none. If our Vortex were of the figure of a Dy, it would have six flat faces, and would be very far from being round, but upon every one of those faces might be put a Vortex of the same figure; if in stead of six flat faces, it had 20, 50, 1000, there might be 1000 Vortices laid on it, every one on a particular face, and you apprehend that the more flat faces a body has, the nearer it comes to a round figure, so as a Diamond cut into flats, if the flats be very small, will be almost as round as a Pearl of the same bigness. The Vortices are not round, but after that manner; they have an infinity of flats on their outside, each of which carrys another Vortex. These flats are very unequal, some great, some small. The lesser of our Vortex, for example, correspond with the Milky way, and sustain all those little Worlds: and whereas two Vortices that rest upon two adjoyning flats, leave a void space between them underneath. Nature, in that case, who knows well how to manage the matter, fills up those void spaces with a little Vortex or two, perhaps with a thousand, which do not at all disturb the rest, and are only an addition of one or two or a thousand Worlds more; so that we may see many more Worlds than our Vortex has flats to carry. I'le hold a wager that though those little Worlds were only made to be thrown into a corner of the Universe, what would otherwise have remain'd useless, although they are unknown to the other Worlds that touch them, they are yet well content in themselves. They are doubtless those whose Suns are not to be seen without the Telescope, and which are prodigious in number. In fine, all these Vortices agree one with another the best they can: and whereas each of them must turn about his Sun without changing place, every one takes the way of turning that is most convenient and easie in his situation. They ingrain one within another like the Wheels of a Watch, and mutually help each others motion. Yet 'tis true, they likewise act one against another. Every World, 'tis said, is like a Bladder that swells it self, and would extend it self, if it were let alone; but it is repress'd by the neighbouring Worlds, and contracts it self, and then swells again, and so on.

Vous estes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en vostre faveur.

Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en luy-mesme une source de lumiere?

Que ce soient ou des écumes, des broüillards, ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces taches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toujours, &amp; adieu le Soleil.

Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris-je: Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changemens: soit lents, soit prompts, mais toujours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens estoient plaisans de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoyent pas encore vû changer. Avoyent-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'experience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se laissoient des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoyent suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela elles diroient, nous avons toûjours vû le mesme Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours esté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas.<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\"> Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroistroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir nostre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque-autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité.</span></span> Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses mêmes qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attens bien que s'il disparoist des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroist de nouvelles, il faut que l'espece se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir esté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démeslez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je croy aisément que tout cela peut estre, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir esté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir esté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différens, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondemens d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naistre &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'estes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, repliquay-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au delà, il faudroit estre plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent estre ou n'estre pas si on veut, ou estre tels que l'on veut, il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P106: I need not then, continued I, think any more of persuading you to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, but I hope, at least, you will compassionate those that live in a Vortex where the Sun is extinct. How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</p> <p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</p> <p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature.
