<P002>WE went one Evening after Supper, to walk in the Park, <LS>the Air was extreamly refreshing, because that day had been very hot; the Moon had been up about an hour, and as she shone between the Trees, made an agreeble mixture of Light and Darkness;</LS> <LS>the Stars were in all their Glory, and not a Cloud appear'd on the Azure Sky;</LS> <LS>I was musing on this awful Prospect, but who can think long of the Moon and Stars, in the Company of a Pretty Woman! I am much mistaken if that's a time for Contemplation:</LS> Well Madam, said I to the Countess, is not the Night as pleasant as the Day? The Day, said she, like a fair Beauty, is clear and dazling; but the Night, like a brown Beauty, more soft and moving. You are Generous, Madam, I reply'd, to prefer the Brown. You that have all the Charms that belong to the Fair: But is there any thing more Beautiful in Nature than the Day? The Heroines of Romances are generally fair, and that Beauty must be perfect, which hath all the advantages of imagination. Tell not me, said she, of perfect Beauty, nothing can be so that is not moving. But since you talk of Romances, why do Lovers in their Songs and Elegies address themselves to the Night? 'Tis the Night, Madam, said I, that crowns their Joys, and therefore deserves their thanks. But 'tis the Night, said she, that hears their Complaints, and how comes it to pass, the day is so little trusted with their secrets? I confess, Madam, said I, the night hath somewhat a more melancholly Air, than the day; we fancy the Stars march more silently than the Sun, and our thoughts wander with the more liberty, whilst we think all the world at rest but our selves: Besides, <LS>the day is more uniform, we see nothing but the Sun, and light in the Firmament;</LS> <LS>whilst the night gives us variety of Objects, and shews us ten thousand Stars, which inspire us with as many pleasant Ideas.</LS> What you say is true, said she, I love the Stars, there is somewhat charming in them, and I could almost be angry with the Sun for effacing 'em. I can never pardon him, I cry'd, for keeping all those Worlds from my sight: What Worlds, said she, looking earnestly upon me, what Worlds do you mean?</P002>



















<P023>Page 55-The love of one fair Northern Lass, Sent up his wit unto the Place it was.</P023>
<P024>Well, he did not forget Orlando's Vial, which was the occasion of his Voyage, but he was cursedly plagu'd to carry it, for Hero's wits are naturally very heavy, and there did not want one drop of it; in conclusion Ariosto, according to his laudable custom, addresseth himself to his Mistress in this manner,</P024>
<P025>Fair Mistress, who for me to Heav'n shall fly, To bring again from thence my wandring wit? Which I still lose, since from that piercing eye The Dart came forth that first my Heart did hit: Nor of my loss at all complain would I, Might I but keep that which remaineth yet: But if it still decrease, within short space, I doubt I shall be in Orlando's case; Yet, well I wot where to recover mine,Tho' not in Paradise, nor Cynthia's Sphere, Yet doubtless in a Place no less divine, In that sweet Face of yours, in that fair Hair, That ruby Lip, in those two starlike eyn, There is my wit, I know it wanders there, And with my Lips, if you would give me leave, I there would search, I thence would it receive.</P025>











<P038>'Tis no matter, said the Countess, I can never suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual darkness. You will be more concern'd for 'em, I reply'd, when I tell you that one of the ancient Philosophers did long since discover the Moon to be the abode of the blessed Souls departed out of this Life, and that all their Happiness consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres; that is, the Musick (I had like to have said Noise) which is made by the motion of the Celestial Bodies; if you have seen a Rarï¿½e Show, you will easily comprehend it: But because the Philosopher pretends to know exactly all they do there, he tells you, that when the Moon is obscur'd by the shadow of the Earth, they no longer hear the Heavenly Musick, but howl like so many Souls in Purgatory; so that the Moon taking pity of 'em, makes all the haste she can to get into the Light again. Methinks then, says she, we should now and then see some of the Blessed Souls arrive here from the Moon, for certainly they are sent to us. I confess indeed, said I, it would be very pleasant to see different Worlds; such a Voyage, tho' but in Imagination, is very delightful; what would it be in effect? It would be much better certainly than to go to Japan, which at best, is but crawling from one end of the World to t' other, and after all to see nothing but Men. Well then, says she, let us travel over the Planets, as fast as we can; what should hinder us? Let us place our selves at all the different Prospects, and from thence consider the Universe. But first, have we any thing more to see in the Moon? I believe not, I reply'd; at least, you have seen all I can shew you. <LS>Coming out of the Moon, towards the Sun, we see Venus, which puts me again in mind of Greenwich. Venus turns upon her self, and round the Sun, as well as the Moon;</LS> they likewise discover by their Tellescopes, that Venus like the Moon, (if I may speak after the same manner) is sometimes new, sometimes full, and sometimes in the wain, according to the diverse situations she is in, in respect of the Earth.</P038>
