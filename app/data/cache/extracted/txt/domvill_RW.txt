<P015>NExt Morning, as soon as the Marchioness could be seen, I sent to know how she did, and to ask her if she could sleep well turning? She sent me word, that she was so well accustomed to that sort of motion of the Earth, that she pass'd the night as quietly as Copernicus himself could have done. Soon after she had Company came to her, who, according to the troublesome Custome in the <RW>Country</RW> , stay'd with her till Evening; and they were obliging in that too; for by the Custom in the Country they had a right to continue their Visits till next morning if they pleas'd; but they were so honest as to be gone. So that the Marchioness and I found our selves at liberty in the Evening. We took our Walk again into the Park, and our Conversation fail'd not to return presently to our <RW>Systems</RW> . She had apprehended them so well, that she disdain'd to discourse of them a second time, but would needs have me lead her to some new matter.</P015>














<P031>What sort of people would they be then, said the Marchioness, with some impatience? In good Faith, Madam, said I, I cannot resolve you. If it were possible that we had Reason, and yet were not Men, and that we were the Inhabitants of the Moon, could we well imagine that there were such Creatures here below as we call Mankind? Could we represent to our selves a thing in Passions so foolish and so wise in reflection, of so short a duration and so long a foresight, so much knowledge in things unprofitable and so much ignorance in the most important, so great a desire of liberty, & so much inclination to Servitude; so much desire to be happy, & so great an incapacity of being so? the People of the Moon must have a great deal of sense to divine all this. We see our selves daily, and yet are to seek to know how we are made. It made some say, that the Gods were full of Nectar when they made Man, and when they came to look upon their Work in a sober temper, they could not forbear laughing.</P031>







































<P072><RW>Seriously and truly</RW> , says the Marchioness, <RW>with an Air of one astonish'd</RW> , all this is a work of great Order, it is very visible that Nature had in her eye the Necessities of every living Being, and that the Distribution of Moons was not a thing done at random. There's none share in it but the Planets farthest distant from the Sun, viz. the Earth, Iupiter and Saturn; for it was not worth the while to give them to Venus and Mercury, who receive but too much Light, whose Nights are short, and which they esteem a much greater benefit of Nature than their Days.</P072>









<P083>This Love, said the Marchioness, laughing, is a strange thing, it has a Salvo for all things and there's no System can do it harm. But tell me pray, and tell me freely, is your System true? Hide nothing from me, I promise you secrecy. To me it seems grounded only on a little Conveniency superficial enough. A Star fixed and luminous in it self like the Sun, ought consequently to be as the Sun is, the Center and Soul of a World, and to have Planets turning about him. Is not this of absolute necessity?</P083>
<P085><RW>No doubt on't</RW> , said I, our Sun is so near us, in comparison of the Suns of other Vortices, that his Light must have infinitely more of force upon our Eyes than theirs: so that we see him, and him only, when we see him; for he dazles all else. But in another great Vortex, another Sun prevails, and he takes his turn and dazles ours, which appears there only in the night with the other forreign Suns, <RW>that is, the fixed Stars</RW> , The people there seat him with them in the great Arch of Heaven, and there he makes a part perhaps of some Bull or Bear. As for the Planets that move about him, as our Earth, for example, they are not discerned so far off, and no body dreams of them. So all the Suns are Day Suns for the Vortices where they are placed, and Night Suns for all the other Vortices. <RW>In their World they are the only ones of their kind</RW> , <RW>every where else they serve only to make up the number of Stars</RW> .</P085>



<P090>Oh! cry'd the Marchioness, give me Quarter, I yield, you overwhelm me with Worlds and Vortices.</P090>
<P091>I know, said I, what I have in store for you yet. You see that White, commonly call'd the Milky way. Can you imagine what it is? 'Tis an infinity of little Stars invisible to the eye, because of their smalness, and so thick set one by the other that they seem to form that continued Whiteness. I wish you saw with a Telescope that crowd of Stars, like Ants in their Hillock, <RW>that Grainery of Worlds</RW> ( <RW>if I may be permitted the expression</RW> ) they resemble in some sort the Maldivian Isles, those twelve thousand little Isles or Banks of Sand, separated only by little Chanels of the Sea, that a man may leap over as easie as so many Ditches. So the little Vortices of the Milky way are so close one to the other, that methinks from one World to the other they may hold discourse, and even shake hands; at least, I believe, the Birds of one World pass easily to another; and Pigeons that are taught to carry Letters, may be as useful there as here in the Levant.</P091>




<P097>Ah! says she, laughing, what kind of Embassadours are those? We might well excuse their Visit, for they serve only to scare people.</P097>


<P102>Those Tails and Beards, said I, are meer Appearances, those foreign Planets differ nothing from ours, but at their entrance into our Vortex, they take the Tail and Beard by a certain strong Illumination of the Sun, which has not yet been well explained between us; but yet we are sure it acts only by a kind of Illumination; we'l judge more certainly of it when we can.</P102>
<P103>I should be very willing then, said she, that Saturn would take a Tail or a Beard in some other Vortex, and spread a Fear there, and having laid aside his terrible Equipage, return and range himself with the other Planets in his ordinary Function.</P103>
<P104>'Tis better, said I, for him, that he should not stir at all out of our Vortex; I have told you what a shock two Vortices make when they push against one another, I believe the poor Planet is then handled rudely enough, and the Inhabitants are not much more at ease. We believe we are unhappy when a Comet appears, whereas 'tis the Comet it self that is unhappy.</P104>
<P106>I need not then, continued I, think any more of persuading you to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, but I hope, at least, you will compassionate those that live in a Vortex where the Sun is extinct. How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, <RW>which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing</RW> , and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</P106>
<P107>You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, <RW>I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so</RW> .</P107>
<P108>Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should <RW>the Roses, which live but a day</RW> , write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</P108>
<P109>Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</P109>
<P110>There is no fear of their perishing, said I; <RW>some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven</RW> , others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature. Has not she the secret of causing Herbs and Plants to spring and dye in a continual Revolution? I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it.</P110>
<P111>In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that I have e'en left them.</P111>
<P113>So, says she, I have now the whole System of the Universe in my Head; I am now a knowing Woman.</P113>
