Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moyndre Etoile; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"11\">Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"12\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je.

On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"14\">il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"15\">j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"16\">Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes.</span></span> Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"17\">Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée.</span></span> Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle?

Madame, répondis-je bien viste, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"21\">ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit.</span></span> Quoy donc, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"22\">croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison?</span></span> Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles.

The English translation omits this notion of being 'rewarded' and presents this as a mere causal statement, thus reducing the poetic quality and sense of relief in the original.","The French narrator (Fontenelle) self-consciously addresses the reader and comments ironically on his own tendency toward description ('je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description...'). The English omits the metafictional aside entirely, thereby weakening the self-aware, conversational tone distinctive in Fontenelle's address.","The description of the stars in French emphasizes that they are of 'pure and brilliant gold', further 'heightened (relevé) by the blue background to which they are attached.' The English translation condenses this to 'the Stars were in all their Glory, and not a Cloud appear'd on the Azure Sky', losing the gold imagery and the sense of depth created by the background, thus dulling the vividness and poetic artistry.","The French states the speaker would have continued dreaming if not for the presence of the Marquise, whose company prevents him from surrendering to contemplation of the sky ('mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune & aux Etoiles'). The English reframes this in a more flippant and gendered manner ('who can think long of the Moon and Stars, in the Company of a Pretty Woman! I am much mistaken if that's a time for Contemplation:'), which introduces a modern, almost comedic register and loses the gentle, respectful play of desire in the original.","In the French, there is an ironic compliment ('vous qui ne l'estes pas'), emphasizing that he is praising the Marquise as a blonde for her generosity in favoring brunettes. The English makes this more general ('You that have all the Charms that belong to the Fair'), omitting the original's subtle humor and playful flirtation.","The French says heroines of novels 'qui sont ce qu’il y a de plus beau dans l’imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes' (heroines who are the most beautiful in the imagination are almost always blondes). The English: 'The Heroines of Romances are generally fair, and that Beauty must be perfect, which hath all the advantages of imagination.' The shift to 'must be perfect' generalizes the idea and the link to imagination is weakened, thus manipulating the literary allusion and the period's ideals of beauty.","The French phrase 'ce n’est rien que la beauté, si elle ne touche' (beauty is nothing if it does not move/touch the heart) is simplified to 'nothing can be so that is not moving.' The translation omits the specific emotional impact and slightly changes the connotation.","The French includes, 'Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit.' This reflection is omitted in the English, losing the direct engagement and personalized character interaction.","The French continues a playful flirtation, suggesting that a 'Blonde like you' would inspire even sweeter dreams than the most beautiful of dark nights. This line is omitted entirely in the English, thus manipulating their relationship dynamic and the ongoing metaphor.","This rejoinder, where the Marquise is not content, is omitted in the English; this removes her assertiveness, diminishing her characterization as witty and engaged.","The French follows with a playful wish about the 'day' being as inspiring for Blondes as the night is for Brunettes; this further blurs the boundary between personal compliment and reflection on natural beauty. This is omitted in the English, reducing the thematic interplay of character and metaphor.","The rhetorical question about why lovers address themselves only to night in songs and elegies is softened in the English, which does not preserve its pointed tone on aesthetics and sentiment ('Pourquoy les Amants ... ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit ... ?').","The French includes a reasoned dialog: the night gets both thanks and complaints, and the day is never confided in. This is only loosely rendered in the English and loses the natural flow of question and answer, as well as the underlying critique of romantic themes.","The French phrase 'qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste & de passionné' makes clear that the day does not inspire something sad and passionate. The English instead says, 'the night hath somewhat a more melancholly Air ...', which changes the subject and weakens the reason, shifting emphasis from the day to the night.","The French explores the possibility that the chance arrangement of stars encourages reverie and a pleasant disorder of thought. The English condenses to 'variety of Objects ... ten thousand Stars ... as many pleasant Ideas', shifting from the chaos and disorder underpinning philosophical musing to simple variety, thus weakening Fontenelle's proto-Enlightenment insight.","The French includes a slight complaint ('je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface'), which the English softens to 'almost be angry', thereby diminishing the affective charge.","The French reads, 'je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes' (I cannot forgive him for depriving me of the sight of all these worlds). The English slightly softens this: 'I can never pardon him... for keeping all those Worlds from my sight.' The emotional register is lower and lacks the bite of the French original.","The French narrator directly admits, 'Vous m’avez mis sur ma folie, & aussi-tost mon imagination s’est échapée.' The English removes this immediate admission and shift in tone and voice, which further distances the reader from the inner processes of the narrator.","The French, 'je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde' is rendered as 'I have had a strong Fancy every Star is a World.' The cautious and almost apologetic confession in the French is reduced to a much bolder, almost boastful, English assertion.","The French: 'je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C’est une idée qui me réjoüit, & qui s’est placée dans mon esprit d’une maniere riante. Selon moy, il n’y a pas jusqu’aux Veritez à qui l’agrément ne soit necessaire.' The translation, 'I will not swear it is true, but must think so, because it is so pleasant to believe it; 'Tis a fancy come into my head, and is very diverting.' The English omits the philosophical point about 'truths needing charm' and the cheerful ('d'une maniere riante') nature of the idea, thus diminishing the Enlightenment ethos and the original's literary wit.","The original French accepts the invitation to share the 'delightful madness,' promising belief if pleasure is found in it. The English rewords as 'provided the pleasure be so great', which shifts from delight in the idea itself to requiring a high level of pleasure, thereby altering the tone and meaning.","The French carefully distinguishes the difference between rational pleasure and the laughter inspired by a comedy, suggesting the pleasure from this idea is something that amuses only the mind. The English, 'tis a Pleasure rather of the fancy than of the Judgment', both changes the distinction (reason to fancy vs. reason to judgment) and omits the playful contrast to Molière's comedies.","The original French includes a defensive challenge and invitation, asking if he thinks one is incapable of pleasures rooted only in reason. The English softens: 'I hope, reply'd she, you do not think me incapable of it,' losing the explicit advocacy for intellectual (not just sensual or emotional) pleasure.","The omission of the interconnected sequence of reasoning about day, blondes, inspiration, the custom of lovers addressing night in poetry, and then a philosophical rumination on the night vs the day and the nature of dreams, removes the complex, cumulative argumentative structure Fontenelle uses to transition from poetic imagery to proto-scientific speculation. The English translation heavily abridges these elements into surface-level observations, subtly shifting the reader's perception of the discourse."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne sçavois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle qui ne sçavoit rien en matiere de Phisique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit estre une Planete; &amp; les Planetes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des Mondes.

Mais on veut sçavoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est-là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera. Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiete d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes.</span></span> Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien, qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyoient le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent, qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; &amp; cent autres resveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité.</span></span> A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique?

Would you have all these Philosophers own themselves to be stark Fools, and confess ingenuously they know not how it comes to pass: No, no, they are not called Wise Men for nothing; tho', let me tell you, most of their Wisdom depends upon the ignorance of their Neighbours. Every man presently gives his Opinion, and how improbable so ever, there are Fools enough of all sorts to believe 'em: One tells you Phaeton is drawn up by a hidden Magnetick Vertue, no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question. Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra: A third tells you, Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company, with an hundred such extravagant fancies, that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers: But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera.

This omission lessens the tone of irony and self-awareness present in the original, subtly shifting the interpersonal dynamic and underplaying the gendered societal context.","The French text describes a 'Machiniste caché dans le Parterre' (a stage machinist or operator hidden in the pit) who anxiously wonders how an extraordinary flight is executed, likening him to philosophers. The English renders this as an 'Engineer in the Pit' who 'is pleased with the motion, and is demonstrating to himself on what it depends,' shifting the machinist's emotional stance from anxious curiosity to technical delight and self-explanation. This softens the original's sense of frustrated curiosity and distances the analogy from the philosophers' own speculative struggles, subtly changing the philosophical metaphor.","In the French, several philosophers speculate on the cause of Phaeton's flight including: 'L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; & cent autres resveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité.' The English omits this entire line, particularly Fontenelle's sarcastic 'I am surprised that these reveries have not ruined the reputation of all Antiquity.' This omission weakens the critique of ancient philosophy and removes an explicit note of irony—altering the work's tone of philosophical skepticism.","The source uses the phrase 'tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; & qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera.' The English omits 'ou d'un ressort' (or a spring/mechanism), which slightly narrows the philosophical analogy for scientifically-oriented readers. This omission minimizes the mechanistic explanations Fontenelle attributes to nature's workings, subtly shifting the scientific allusion.","The French Marquise says 'la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique?' and receives the answer 'Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte.' The English shifts this to 'I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it;' omitting the nuance that the narrator fears people will soon be ashamed, not that 'we' necessarily will be. The use of 'we shall quickly be asham'd of it' alters the collective subjectivity of the philosophical embarrassment.","The source's 'On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, & que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties.' is translated as 'they will have the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement.' The translation adds the phrase 'which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement,' which is an explanatory addition not present in the original and shifts the tone toward an expository style rather than ironic observation.","The French, 'J'ay vû des gens qui l'en estimoyent moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoyent connu,' meaning 'I have seen people who esteemed it less since they came to know it', is rendered as 'For most have the less esteem of it since they have pretended to know it.' This changes the observational and anecdotal phrasing of the original, replacing direct observation with a generalization about 'most' people and adding the skeptical implication of 'pretended to know'. This makes the criticism sharper and more universal, shifting the tone from personal narrative to broader critique."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P005: Je ne sçay pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en verité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la teste un faux Merveilleux envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Ils n'admirent la Nature que parce qu'ils la croyent une espece de Magie où l'on n'entend rien, &amp; il est seur qu'une chose est deshonorée auprés d'eux, dés qu'elle peut estre conceüe.</span></span> Mais, Madame, continuay-je, vous estes si bien disposée à entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire, que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, &amp; à vous montrer le Monde. </p><p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

The translation generalizes this to 'People generally admire what they do not comprehend, they have a Veneration for Obscurity,' which omits the notion of the 'false marvelous' and replaces it with a more neutral cognitive gap ('what they do not comprehend'), subtly shifting the emphasis from belief in the supernatural to mere ignorance or incomprehension.","The French says people 'admire Nature only because they believe it to be a kind of magic in which nothing can be understood, and are certain that something is dishonored, in their eyes, as soon as it can be conceived.' The English reduces this to 'look upon Nature while they do not understand her, as a kind of Magick, and despise her below Legerdemain, when once they are acquainted with her.' This shifts from expressing that understanding removes the sense of wonder (and thus respect) to a negative judgment ('despise her below Legerdemain') using an English-specific phrase, and omits the broader point about dishonor upon being able to conceive or understand a thing."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien-aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus interessée que je ne l'ay, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander</span></span>.

Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question?</span></span> Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient.</span></span> n<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">ostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe.</span></span> Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible.</span></span> Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus.</span></span> Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs.

Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien.</span></span> Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides.

Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule.</span></span> Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz.

Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"18\">je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre</span></span>? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabatu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez-vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"19\">je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celuy qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préseance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"20\">Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-estre sans s'en appercevoir, ce principe qui le flate, &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'interesser à une affaire de pure speculation.</span></span> Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'auroit donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"21\">Copernic luy-mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long-temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez-vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire.</span></span> Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avois laissées. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"22\">Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au-delà de tous les Cercles des Planetes sont les Etoiles fixes, Voila nostre rivage.</span></span> Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois necessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voye répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce Cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air sçavant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ay-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoyent, en voyant de certaines figures de Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voye icy.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, 'tis not a true Shepherds life to talk of the Stars and Planets: See if they pass their time so in Astrea. That sort of Shepherds Craft, reply'd she, is too dangerous for me to learn: I love the honest Caldaeans, and you must teach me their Rules, if you would have me improve in their Science. But let us proceed, When they had rank'd the Heavens in that manner you tell me, pray, what is the next Question? The next, said I, is the disposing the several parts of the Universe, which the Learned call making a Systeme; but before I expound the first Systeme, I would have you observe, we are all naturally like that Mad man at Athens, who fancy'd all the Ships were his that came into the Port Pyroeum: Nor is our Folly less extravagant, we believe all things in Nature design'd for our use; and do but ask a Philosopher, to what purpose there is that prodigious company of fix'd Stars, when a far less number would perform the service they do us? He answers coldly, they were made to please our Sight. Upon this Principle they imagin'd the Earth rested in the Centre of the Universe, while all the Celestial Bodies (which were made for it) took the Page 15 pains to turn round to give light to it. They plac'd the Moon above the Earth, Mercury above the Moon, after Venus the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, above all these they set the Heaven of fix'd Stars, the Earth was just in the middle of those Circles which contain the Planets, and the greater the Circles were, they were the farther distant from the Earth, and by consequence the farthest Planets took up the most time in finishing their course, which in effect is true: But why, said the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, interrupting me, do you dislike this Systeme? It seems to me very Clear and Intelligible. However, Madam, said I, I will make it plainer; for should I give it you as it came from Ptolomy its Author, or from some who have since study'd it, I should fright you, I fancy, instead of diverting you. Since the Motions of the Planets are not so regular, but that sometimes they go faster, sometimes slower, sometimes are nearer the Earth, and sometimes farther from it; the Ancients did invent I do not know how many Orbs or Circles involv'd one within another, which they thought would salve all Objections; this confusion of Circles was so great, that at that time when they knew no better, a certain King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but not much troubled with Religion, said, That had God consulted him when he made the World, he would have told him how to have fram'd it better. The fancy was very Atheistical, and no doubt the Instructions he would have given the Almighty, was the suppressing those Circles with which they had clog'd the Celestial Motions, and the taking away two or three superfluous Heavens which they had placed above the fixed Stars; for these Philosophers to explain the Motion of the Celestial Bodies, had above the uppermost Heaven (which we see,) found another of Crystal, to influence and give Motion to the inferiour Heavens; and wherever they heard of another Motion, they presently clapp'd up a Crystal Heaven which cost 'em Page 17 nothing. But why must their Heaven be of Crystal, said the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, would nothing else serve as well? No, no, I reply'd, nothing so well; for the Light was to come thro' them, and yet they were to be solid. Aristotle would have it so, he had found Solidity to be one of their Excellencies, and when he had once said it, no body would be so rude as to question it. But it seems there were Comets much higher than the Philosophers expected, which as they pass'd along brake the Crystal Heavens, and confounded the Universe. But to make the best of a bad Market, they presently melt down their broken Glass, and to Aristotles Confusion, made the heavens fluid; and by the observations of these latter Ages it is now out of doubt, that Venus and Mercury turn round the Sun, and not round the Earth, according to the Antient Systeme, which is now every where exploded, and all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush. But that which I am going to lay down, will salve all, and is so clear, that the King of Arragon himself may spare his Advice. Methinks, saith the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, your Philosophy is a kind of Out-cry, where he that offers to do the work cheapest, carries it from all the rest. 'Tis very true, said I, Nature is a great Huswife, she always makes use of what costs least, let the difference be never so inconsiderable; and yet this frugality is accompany'd with an extraordinary magnificence, which shines thro' all her works; that is, she is magnificent in the design, but frugal in the Execution; and what can be more praise worthy, than a great design accomplish'd with a little Expence? But in our Ideas we turn things topsy-turvy, we place our thrift in the design, and are at ten times more charge in Workmanship than it requires, which is very ridiculous: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Imitate Nature then, saith she, in your Systeme, and give me as little trouble as you can to comprehend you.</span></span> Fear it not, Madam, said I, we have done with our impertinencies: Imagine then a German all'd Copernicus confounding every thing, earing in pieces the beloved Circles of Antiquity, and shattering their Crystal Heavens like so many Glass Windows, seiz'd with the noble Rage of Astronomy, he snatcheth up the Earth from the Centre of the Universe, sends her packing, and placeth the Sun in the Centre to which it did more justly belong, the Planets no longer turn round the Earth, and do not inclose it in the Circles they describe; if they give us light, it is but by chance, and as they meet us in their way. All now turns round the Sun, the Earth her self goes round the Sun, and Copernicus to punish the Earth for her former Lazyness, makes her contribute all he can to the motion of the Planets and Heavens, and now stripp'd of all the heavenly Equipage with which she was so gloriously attended, she hath nothing left her but the Moon, which still turns round about her: Fair and softly, saith the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, I fancy you your self are seiz'd with the Noble Fury of Astronomy; a little less Rapture, and I shall understand you the better. The Sun You say is in the Centre of the Universe, and is immovable; what follows next? It is Mercury, said I, he turns round the Sun, so that the Sun is the Centre of the Circle wherein Mercury moves; above Mercury is Venus, who turns also round the Sun; after comes the Earth, which being placed higher than Mercury and Venus, makes a greater circle round the Sun than either of them; at last come Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, in the same order I name 'em, so that Saturn hath the greatest circle round the Sun, which is the reason he is a longer time in making his Revolution than any of the other Planets. And the Moon, you have forgot her, said she: We shall quickly find her again, said I; the Moon turns round the Earth, and doth not leave her, but as the Earth advanceth in the Circle, which she describes about the Sun, and if the Moon turns round the Sun, it is because she will not quit the Earth; I understand you, said she, and I love the Moon for staying with us when all the other Planets do abandon us; nay, I fear your German would have willingly taken her away too if he could, for in all his proceedings, I find he had a great spight to the Earth. 'Twas well done of him, said I, to abate the Vanity of Mankind, who had taken up the best place in the Universe, and it pleaseth me to see the Earth in the croud of the Planets. Sure, said she, you do not think their Vanity extends it self as far as Astronomy! Do you believe you have humbled me, in telling me the Earth goes round the Sun? For my part I do not think my self at all the worse for't. I confess, said I, Madam, I believe a Fair Lady would be much more concern'd for her place at a Ball, than for her rank in the Universe; and the Precedence of two Planets will not make half such a noise in the World, as that of two Ambassadours; however the same inclination which reigns at a Ceremony, governs in a Systeme, and if you love the uppermost place in the one, the Philosopher desires the Centre in the other; he flatters himself that all things were made for him, and insensibly believes a matter of pure speculation to be a point of Interest. This is a Calumny, said she, you have invented against Mankind; why did they receive this Systeme if it was so abasing? I know not, said I, but I am sure Copernicus himself distrusted the success of his Opinion, he was a long time before he would venture to publish it, nor had he done it then without the importunity of his Friends. But do you know what became of him? the very day they brought him the first Proof of his Book, he dy'd; he foresaw he should never be able to clear all the contradictions, and very wisely slipt out of the way. I would be just to all the World, said the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>; but 'tis hard to fancy we move and yet see we do not change our place; we find our selves in the Morning where we lay down at Night: Perhaps you will tell me the whole Earth moves-Yes certainly, said I, it is the same case as if you fell asleep in a Boat upon the River, when you awake you find your self in the same place, and the same situation in respect of all the parts of the Boat. 'Tis true, she reply'd, but here's a great difference when I awake I find another shoar, and that shows me, my Boat hath chang'd place. But 'tis not the same with the Earth, I find all things as I left 'em. No, no, said I, there is another Shoar too; You know that beyond the circles of the Planets are fix'd Stars, there is our Shoar. I am upon the Earth, and the Earh makes a great circle round the Sun, I look for the centre of the circle and see the Sun there, I then direct my sight beyond the Sun in a right Line, and should certainly discover the fix'd Stars which answer to the Sun, but that the light of the Sun effaceth 'em: But at Night I easily perceive the Stars which corresponded with him in the day, which is exactly the same thing; if the Earth did not change its place in the Circle where it is, I should see the Sun always against the same fix'd Stars, but when the Earth doth change its place, the Sun must answer to other Stars and there again is your Shoar, which is always changing. And seeing the Earth makes her circle in a year, I see the Sun likewise in the space of a year answer successively to the whole Circle of the fix'd Stars, which Circle is call'd the Zodiack: I will draw you the Figure of it, if you please, on the Sand? 'Tis no matter, said she, I can do well enough without it; beside, it will give an Air of Learning to my Park which I would not have in it: For I have heard of a certain Philosopher, who being Shipwrack'd, and cast upon an unknown Island, seeing several Mathematical Figures trac'd on the Sea-shore, cry'd out to those that follow'd him, Courage, Courage, my Companions, the Isle is inhabited, behold the Footsteps of Men; But you may spare your Figures, such Footsteps are not decent here.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires</span></span>, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy.

'Tis no matter, said she, I can do well enough without it; beside, it will give an Air of Learning to my Park which I would not have in it: For I have heard of a certain Philosopher, who being Shipwrack'd, and cast upon an unknown Island, seeing several Mathematical Figures trac'd on the Sea-shore, cry'd out to those that follow'd him, Courage, Courage, my Companions, the Isle is inhabited, behold the Footsteps of Men; But you may spare your Figures, such Footsteps are not decent here.</p>","explanations":["The French 'une ame plus interessée' (literally: a more interested/self-interested/bent mind) is translated as 'mercenary', which adds a negative, materialistic or self-serving connotation absent from the source, thus subtly changing the tone about geometry's demands.","The English 'time to spare as Astronomy requires' emphasizes personal free time, whereas the original simply comments on having as much leisure as astronomy requires, a subtle tonal shift closer to modern work/life metaphors.","'je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie' ('I see I must confine myself to Astronomy') becomes 'I am convinced I must stick to Astronomy', which expresses a decisive conviction rather than a resigned limitation, thereby softening the tone of exclusion.","The English translation completely omits the reference to speaking 'Caldéen' (Chaldean), thus removing the playful request to 'speak Chaldean', which is both a whimsical and historically loaded literary reference. This omission erases a nuance about ancient astronomical traditions and the social context of learned women.","The translation omits the phrase 'dont vous avez entendu parler' ('whom you have heard of') when referencing the 'Fou Athenien', making it less personal and less connected to the Marquise's supposed prior knowledge.","The English shifts 'réjoüir la veüe' (to rejoice/please the sight) to 'service they do us' before rendering 'please our Sight', introducing utilitarian language ('service') absent in the French and subtly making natural phenomena sound more functional.","The French includes the Marquise explicitly declaring her contentment and understanding ('je vous declare que je m'en contente'), but in English this assurance is omitted, making her less personally engaged with the cosmos.","The French carries an ironic sense of 'adoucir' (soften, make more palatable), which in English is made more neutral and pragmatic (I will make it plainer); the idea of sweetening or softening a harsh truth is downplayed.","The translation calls the King's thought 'very Atheistical', where the French uses 'libertine' (which historically implies irreverence or free-thinking, but not necessarily atheism). This change tightens the anti-religious interpretation, impacting perceptions in a time of considerable religious tension.","The omission of 'par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries' loses the nuance that the crystal spheres were intended to save (explain away) oddities in the system, thus erasing the original’s mild criticism and the sense of intellectual patchwork.","The translation makes Aristotle's assertion less absurd and less ironized by condensing 'personne n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter' (nobody would be so bold as to question it) to a milder 'no body would be so rude as to question it', reducing the satirical tone about blindly accepted authority.","The English adds the expression about 'melt down their broken Glass' and 'to Aristotle's Confusion', introducing language and a tone not present in the original, boosting dramatic color and thus subtly manipulating the atmosphere.","The English adds an anachronistic editorial comment: 'and all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush', which is not in the French and introduces a dismissive, judgmental Enlightenment-era tone absent from Fontenelle's more measured phrasing.","The English uses 'will salve all, and is so clear', while the French praises its 'simplicité charmante' (charming simplicity) as the sole reason for preference, thus the translation slightly misses the appeal to elegance and charm.","The phrase 'Nature is a great Huswife, she always makes use of what costs least' reinterprets Fontenelle’s metaphor. The French's 'épargne extraordinaire' is generalized to 'always makes use of what costs least', giving the English a more economic, practical tone than the original philosophical elegance.","The English embellishes Copernicus's actions with phrases like 'confounding everything', 'shattering their Crystal Heavens like so many Glass Windows', and 'sends [Earth] packing', which are not present in the French, creating a more dramatic, even comical, tone than Fontenelle's original.","The translation shifts 'pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué' ('to punish her for the long rest she had ascribed to herself') to 'for her former Lazyness', moving the reader's sense from a poetic conceit to a moral failing, which alters the connotation.","The phrase 'stripp'd of all the heavenly Equipage with which she was so gloriously attended', is absent in the French, which simply says the Earth is left with only the Moon; the English translation adds a sense of grandeur and loss not present in Fontenelle.","The English 'great spight to the Earth' intensifies the original's 'mal intentionné' (ill-disposed), presenting Copernicus as adversarial rather than simply indifferent or unsentimental, thus manipulating the tone.","The English, by changing 'rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celuy qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre' (rank one holds in the Universe compared to that one believes due in a room) to 'place at a Ball', introduces a new social analogy, adding a layer of metaphor not in the original.","The English omits 'Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-estre sans s'en appercevoir, ce principe qui le flate, & son coeur ne laisse pas de s'interesser à une affaire de pure speculation.' Instead, it condenses the argument, making the philosophical self-interest appear less subconscious or emotionally invested than in the French.","The English renders Copernicus's reluctance as 'he was a long time before he would venture to publish it, nor had he done it then without the importunity of his Friends. But do you know what became of him? the very day they brought him the first Proof of his Book, he dy'd; he foresaw he should never be able to clear all the contradictions, and very wisely slipt out of the way.' The French suggests Copernicus died upon receiving the first printed copy to avoid contradictions, which is humorously mythicized; the English presents it with a more serious, slightly moralizing tone, making it sound like a wise stratagem rather than an ironic escape.","The translation omits the phrase 'le rivage est changé aussi' in rendering the idea of the changing shore, minimizing the vividness and philosophical parallel, weakening the explanatory metaphor."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voye que des pas d'Amans, c'est à dire, vostre nom &amp; vos chiffres gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil.</span></span> J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le Cercle que nous décrivons nous-mesmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur nostre teste, comment se fait-il?

Tell not me, said she, of Lovers and Adorers, I am for my beloved Sun and Planets. But how comes it to pass that the Sun as to the fixed Stars compleats his course but in a year, and yet goes over our Heads every day? Did you never, I reply'd, observe a Bowl on a Bowling-green? It runs towards the Block, and at the same time turns very often round it self, so that the Parts which were above are below, and those which were below are above; just so it is with the Earth, at the same time that she advanceth on the Circle which in a years space she makes round the Sun, in twenty four hours she turns round her self; so that in twenty four hours every part of the Earth loseth the Sun, and recovers him again, and as it turns towards the Sun, it seems to rise, and as it turns from him, it seems to fall. It is very pleasant, said she, that the Earth must take all upon her self, and the Sun do nothing. And when the Moon, the other Planets, and the fix'd Stars seem to go over our Heads every twenty four hours, you'll say that too is only Fancy? Pure Fancy, said I, which proceeds from the same cause, for the Planets compleat their courses round the Sun at unequal times, according to their unequal distances, and that which we see to day answer to a certain Point in the Zodiack or Circle of the fix'd Stars, to morrow we see answer to another Point, because it is advanced on its own Circle as well as we are advanced upon ours. We move, and the Planets move too, which must make a great alteration; so that what seems irregular in the Planets, proceeds only from our motion, when in truth they are all very regular: I will suppose 'em so, said the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, but I would not have their Regularity put the Earth to so great trouble; methinks you exact too much Activity from so ponderous a Mass. But, said I, had you rather that the Sun and all the Stars, which are vast great Bodies, should in twenty four hours travel such an infinity of Miles, and make so prodigious a Tour as they needs must, if the Earth did not turn round it self every twenty four hours? Oh, said she, the Sun and the Stars are all Fire, their Motion is not very difficult; but the Earth, I fancy, is a little unweildy: That signifies nothing, I reply'd, for what do you think of a first rate Ship, which carries near an hundred Guns, and a thousand Men, beside her Provisions and other Furniture? you see one puff of Wind makes it sail on the Water, because the Water is liquid, and being easily separated doth very little resist the motion of the Ship: So the Earth tho' never so Massive is as easily born up by the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water, and fills all that great Space where the Planets float; for where would you the Earth should be fastned to resist the motion of the Celestial Matter, and not be driven by it? You may as well fancy a little block of Wood can withstand the current of a River. But pray, said she, how can the Earth with all its weight be born up by your Celestial Matter, which must be very light, because it is so fluid? It doth not argue, said I, that what is most fluid is most light: for what think you of the great Vessel I mention'd but now, which with all its Burthen is yet lighter than the Water it floats on? I will have nothing to do with that great Vessel, said she, and I begin to apprehend my self in some danger on such a whirlegigg as you have made of the Earth: There is no danger, I reply'd; but Madam, if you are afraid, we will have the Earth supported by four Elephants, as the Indians believe it. Hey day, cry'd she, here's another Systeme; however I love those People for taking care of themselves, they have a good Foundation to trust to, while you Copernicans are a little too venturous with the Celestial Matter; and yet I fancy if the Indians thought the Earth in the least danger of sinking, they would double their number of Elephants.

The English summary omits the clear phrase 'en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, & que celles d'en bas montent en haut,' which illustrates the rotation's effect and removes some specificity about simultaneous movements, subtly flattening the vivid imagery.","The English translation expands and partially conflates two separate ideas: (1) the apparent daily revolution of the sky is only an imagination from Earth's movement, (2) both Earth and the Planets change position in the zodiac because of both their and our motions. The target adds a lengthier, more technical explanation not present with such detail in the original, thereby shifting the dialogic tone, making it less immediate and more didactic.","The French includes 'on ne l'a guere ménagée, & pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité', which adds a tone of complaint about how the regularity is at the expense of the Earth being 'mistreated' and made to act far more nimbly than its size warrants. The English simplifies this to a milder observation about 'exacting too much activity', losing the playful, critical implication.","The French describes a 'gros Navire monté de cent-cinquante pieces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, & d'une tres-grande nombre de Marchãdises', a much larger ship than the 'first rate Ship, which carries near an hundred Guns, and a thousand Men, beside her Provisions and other Furniture' in the English. The reduction in scale makes the metaphor less striking and changes the sense of massive inertia.","The original French says 'où nagent les Planetes' (where the Planets swim), which uses a playful metaphor suited to Fontenelle's style. The English neutralizes this with 'where the Planets float', which lessens the lively imagery and subtly changes the tone.","The French 'cramponnée' means more literally being 'clamped' or 'anchored', suggesting physical resistance, whereas the English 'where would you the Earth should be fastned to resist' is more vague and less evocative, thereby diminishing the vividness and playfulness of the original description.","The phrase 'Que dites-vous de nostre gros Vaisseau, qui avec tout son poids est plus léger que l'eau, puis qu'il y surnage?' in French says the ship is (with all its weight) lighter than water since it floats.

This changes the target (from English people to undefined neighbours), omits the comparison of philosophical gaiety, and adds a new, more negative analogy (ineffectually settling the nation like we settle the world in the Moon), thus subtly shifting both the subject and the tone.","The French passage about 'Tartares ... Pelerinage vers ce Grand Prestre, qui ne sort jamais d'un lieu obscur...' describing a religious pilgrimage to a reclusive high priest, is omitted in the translation and replaced directly by the segment on Circassians. This omission removes cultural and religious context about Tartars, reducing the diversity and anthropological curiosity Fontenelle originally presents.","The French distinguishes 'petits Tartares qui iront voler des Femmes pour les Turcs & pour les Persans'—specifically 'stealing women'—while the translation says 'going to steal Concubines,' which shifts the connotation with the more specific and legalistic 'concubines' over the broader, and more critical, original term 'women.' This softens the critique inherent in the source and narrows its meaning.","The original French 'enfin, nous qui debiterons peut-estre encore des resveries' indicates that 'perhaps we too will still be uttering fantasies,' self-deprecatingly including the speakers among those odd customs, whereas the English is shifted to 'and at last our own dear Countrymen, it may be in some points as ridiculous as the best of 'em,' which distances the speaker from the critique and instead lumps all compatriots (rather than the self) into the list, making the tone less self-effacing and more detached.","The French explains that the Circassian husbands find in their wives' favors a surplus which they leave to strangers, but the English simplifies and shifts this to 'their Husbands have enough, and to spare to a Stranger.' The nuance of 'abandonner aux Etrangers' (abandon to strangers) is stronger than 'to spare,' and the sense of surplus (superflu) is dulled, reducing both the implied agency and the mildly scandalous undertone.","The French line (interrupted) 'cela est cause qu'on prend davantage, repliquay-je, au lieu que...' has a more suggestive conclusion implying why men in their country are more possessive, but this is replaced in the English by the generic, '’Tis because they make more use, I replied, of—Hold your peace, said she, and no more of your Fooleries,' making the sexual innuendo more explicit and crude.

The English compresses this to 'Visionary and meer Fancy' and 'it may be so still', diluting the self-ironic tone and open-endedness of the original.","The French uses the metaphor of Civil Wars to describe a pragmatic, opportunistic stance, keeping 'intelligences' (contacts, communications) and 'des ménagemens' (diplomatic relations) with even one's enemies. The English truncates this, focusing on 'hold intelligence with the opposite Party' but omits 'des ménagemens avec ses Ennemis mesmes' (diplomacy with enemies), which manipulates the analogy to be less nuanced.","The French details that he keeps himself in a state to 'ranger à leur opinion avec honneur, si elle avoit le dessus' (align himself with the opposing opinion with honor if it prevailed), emphasizing a readiness to change honorably. The English compresses this to a vague analogy to religious conversion and adds 'as some honest Gentlemen in point of Religion', importing a culturally specific and moralizing analogy absent from the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P022: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Suposons qu'il n'y ait jamais eu nul commerce entre Paris &amp; Saint-Denis, &amp; qu'un Bourgeois de Paris qui ne sera jamais sorty de sa Ville, soit sur les Tours de Nostre Dame, &amp; voye Saint Denis de loin</span></span>, on luy demandera s'il croit que Saint Denis soit habité comme Paris.

This substitution not only erases specific French cultural context but imposes a British one, shifting the social meaning from a Parisian bourgeois (middle-class layman) to a Cockney (working-class Londoner), and swapping the cathedral for an ahistorical 'Pyramid' in London. This indirect manipulation alters the historical and cultural connotations, making the example less about urban proximity in France and more about England.","Replacing 'mon Bourgeois s'obstinera toujours' (my Bourgeois will persist) with 'my Cockney still persists' imports culturally charged connotations of stubborn Cockneys. This recasts the original's gently mocking tone of middle-class narrow-mindedness into a stereotyping tone toward working-class Londoners, thus altering the social nuance and attitude.","'Nostre Saint Denis c'est la Lune, & chacun de nous est ce Bourgeois de Paris, qui n'est jamais sorty de sa Ville.' ('Our St Denis is the Moon, and each of us is that Parisian bourgeois who has never left his city.') is replaced with 'The Moon is our Greenwich, and every one of us as meer Cockneys as he that never was out of the sound of Bow-Bell.' This intensifies the cultural relocation: Bow-Bell references Cockney speech, further emphasizing English working-class stereotypes instead of the French original's targeted general populace.","The phrase 'la Lune n'est point du tout faite comme la Terre' ('the Moon is not at all made like the Earth') is translated as 'the Moon is not at all like the Earth.' The omission of 'made' or 'constructed' subtly shifts the meaning from physical constitution or structure (composition/form) to a generic assertion of unlikeness, losing the focus on material similarity, which ties to scientific themes in Fontenelle's argumentation.","'Je vous vois toûjours pour la Lune, repris-je, un reste d'estime dont vous ne sçauriez vous défaire' translates to 'You are altogether for the Moon, said I, she is much oblig'd to you.' The original teases the Marquise for her persistent esteem for the Moon, noting she cannot rid herself of it. The English shifts to a literal statement that the Moon 'is much obliged to you', lessening the nuanced, ironic tone and the notion of habitual bias.","'la lumiere est composée de petites balles qui bondissent sur ce qui est solide, & retournent d'un autre costé, au lieu qu'elles passent au travers de ce qui leur presente des ouvertures en ligne droite, comme l'air ou le verre' is translated as 'you must know that Light is made up of certain little Balls, which rebound from what is solid, but pass through what admits of an entrance in a right Line, as Air or Glass'. While somewhat accurate, the translation omits that the 'balls return the other way' and simplifies 'ce qui leur presente des ouvertures' (what presents openings to them) to 'what admits of an entrance', which tones down the scientific imagery and diminishes the analogy of bouncing vs. passing through, thus subtly manipulating the explanation's clarity.","'nous ne la voyons que comme un Corps lumineux, & nous ignorons que ce soit une grosse masse, toute semblable à la Terre' is rendered as 'we can only discover her to be a Body of Light, and do not perceive that she is a great Masse, altogether like the Earth'. The shift from 'noi'r' (we ignore that it's a great mass just like the Earth) to 'do not perceive' softens the statement from active ignorance to mere lack of perception, altering the cognitive dynamic the author highlights.","Repetition of explanation above: the translation attenuates the sense of ignorance in the original French phrase regarding the Moon's similarity to Earth, downplaying the idea that people fail to recognize the Moon's true material nature.","'Je ne me consoleray jamais, dit-elle, de l'injustice que nous faisons à la Terre, & de la préoccupation trop favorable où nous sommes pour la Lune, si vous ne m'assurez que les Gens de la Lune ne connaissent pas mieux leurs avantages que nous connoissons les nostres, & qu'ils prennent nostre Terre pour un Astre, sans sçavoir que leur habitation en est un aussi.' is translated as 'I shall never be satisfy'd, said she, for the Injustice we do the Earth, and the too favourable opinion we have of the Moon, till you assure me that the People in the Moon are as little acquainted with their Advantages, as we are with ours, and that they take our Earth for a Planet, without knowing theirs is one too.' The translation condenses 'préoccupation trop favorable' (overly favorable preoccupation/bias) to 'too favourable opinion', underrepresenting the concept of deep-seated bias. Additionally, 'ne connaissent pas mieux leurs avantages que nous connaissons les nostres' is rendered as 'are as little acquainted with their Advantages as we are with ours', a lesser form of awareness than the original, which involves knowing (not just being acquainted with) their advantages.","'Nous leur paroissons faire assez regulierement nos fonctions d'Astres' becomes 'we appear to them to perform very regularly our function of a Planet'. This removes the plural 'fonctions' (functions/roles) and replaces 'Astres' (celestial bodies) with 'Planet,' which limits Fontenelle's reference to all celestial roles and inserts specificity not in the original.","'La moitié de la Lune qui se trouva tournée vers nous au commencement du Monde, y a toûjours esté tournée depuis; elle ne nous presente jamais que ces yeux, cette bouche, & le reste de ce visage que nostre imagination luy compose sur le fondement des tâches qu'elle nous montre.' The translation becomes 'the Eyes, Mouth, and Face which we have fancy'd of the Spots in her, are still the same, and if the other opposite half should appear to us, we should no doubt fancy another Figure from the different Spots that are in it'—omitting the statement about the same half always having been turned to us since the beginning of the world. This omission shifts the scientific assertion regarding tidal locking and removes the implied constancy, thus manipulating the clarity of the original concept.","'Ce n'est pas que la Lune ne tourne sur elle-mesme, elle y tourne en autant de temps qu'autour de la Terre, c'est à dire, en un mois; mais lors qu'elle fait une partie de ce tremblement, & de s'imaginer que nous avons dans le Ciel comme un mouvement de Pendule qui va & vient.' The translation rewrites this as 'the Moon hath a kind of trembling...she attributes that trembling to us, and fancies that we have in the Heavens the motion of a Pendulum...' This not only reorders the scientific explanation but attributes the 'trembling' (libration) to the Moon's perception of the Earth, which is not what the original says. The original makes the trembling a real physical phenomenon, not a subjective impression of the Moon; the translation muddies the scientific analogy to a pendulum, and the Moon's misattribution, altering the conceptual understanding of tidal locking and libration."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P026: Toutes ces Planetes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">dit la Marquise</span></span>, sont faites comme nous, qui rejettons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mesmes.

The translation uses 'the Countess,' which misrepresents the title and can change assumptions about status and social roles, thus introducing a cultural shift.","In the French, there's an explicit comparative weakening: sunlight is 'lumière éclatante' that becomes 'lumière blanchâtre' (whitish light) when reflected from the Earth to the Moon. The English translation renders both directions almost identically ('as pale and weak when it arrives there'), erasing the nuanced gradation from brightness to paleness and losing the richer connotation of 'éclatante' (dazzling/brilliant) versus 'blanchâtre' (whitish, i.e. dimmed). This generalization alters the reader’s understanding of Fontenelle’s careful description of the physics of light.","The French uses the idiom 'Nous n'avons garde de voir cette moitié' (We take care not to see/cannot possibly see that half), which is a nuanced expression for 'it's impossible for us to see.' The translation simplifies this to 'we cannot see it then,' losing the idiomatic and rhetorical caution, and thereby flattening the narrative voice and its interplay with the audience.","The phrase 'nous sommes en Decours pour elles' uses the specialized lunar phase term 'décours' (waning moon, or last quarter), which carries scientific precision and period-appropriate vocabulary. The translation 'we are then in the Wayn to them' is an incorrect and archaic form; while it gestures towards 'wane,' it is obscure and confusing, and fails to convey the moon phase terminology to a modern English reader—thus misleading or obscuring the meaning."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je sçauray tout le reste quand il me plaira, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.</span></span> Je vois en gennral que dans la Lune ils ont un mois à rebours du nostre, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">je gage que quand nous avons pleine Lune, c'est que toute la moitié lumineuse de la Lune est tournée vers toute la moitié obscure de la Terre; qu'alors ils ne nous voyent point du tout, &amp; qu'ils content Nouvelle Terre.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Je ne voudrois pas qu'il me fust reproché de m'estre fait expliquer tout au long une chose si aisée.</span></span> Mais les Eclipses comment vont-elles?

Instead, it assures her ('il n'y a pas d'apparence...'), creating a tone of comforting reassurance. The English changes it to a direct question and adds 'do you think', making the tone more confrontational and less consoling, shifting the dynamic of the exchange.","The English translation splits the original complex thought into two sentences and introduces the speculative question 'Is it not consistent with Ignorance to spread it self every where?', which is an addition not present in the French. This shifts the original's nuance. In the French, Ignorance is described as inherently likely to be widespread, not a matter for rhetorical questioning. The English thus subtly alters the philosophical framing from a statement to an open query, making the narrator appear less certain."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P033: Vous me surprenez, reprit-elle.

Il n'est pas possible, repliquay-je, que Messieurs de l'Observatoire vous en instruisent, il faut le demander à Astolphe, qui fut conduit dans la Lune par Saint Jean. Je vous parle d'une des plus agréables folies de l'Arioste, &amp; je suis seur que vous serez bien-aise de la sçavoir. J'avoüe qu'il eust mieux fait de n'y pas mêler Saint Jean, dont le nom est si digne de respect; mais enfin c'est une licence Poëtique, qui peut seulement passer pour un peu trop gaye. Tout le Poëme est dédié à un Cardinal, &amp; un grand Pape l'a honoré d'une approbation éclatante que l'on voit au devant de quelques Editions. Voicy de quoy il s'agit. Roland, Neveu de Charlemagne, estoit devenu fou, parce que la belle Angelique luy avoit préferé Medor. Un jour Astolphe, brave Paladin, se trouva dans le Paradis Terrestre, qui estoit sur la cime d'une Montagne tres-haute, où son Hippogrife l'avoit porté. Là il rencontre Saint Jean, qui luy dit que pour guerir la folie de Roland, il estoit necessaire qu'ils fissent ensemble le Voyage de la Lune. Astolphe qui ne demandoit qu'à voir du Pays, ne se fait point prier, &amp; aussi-tost voila un Chariot de feu qui enleve par les airs l'Apostre &amp; le Paladin. Comme Astolphe n'estoit pas grand Philosophe, il fut fort surpris de voir la Lune beaucoup plus grande qu'elle ne luy avoit paru de dessus la Terre. Il fut bien plus surpris encore de voir d'autres Fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Montagnes, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forests, &amp; ce qui m'auroit bien surpris aussi, des Nymphes qui chassoient dans ces Forests. Mais ce qu'il vit de plus rare dans la Lune, c'estoit un Vallon où se trouvoit tout ce qui se perdoit sur la Terre, de quelque espece qu'il fust, &amp; les Couronnes, &amp; les Richesses, &amp; la Renommée, &amp; une infinité d'Esperances, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">le temps qu'on donne au Jeu, &amp; les Aumônes qu'on fait faire aprés sa mort, &amp; les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes, &amp; les Soûpirs des Amans.</span></span> </p><p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sçais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune.

Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin. C'est que les Papes ont prétendu estre Maistres de Rome &amp; de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, &amp; la verité est qu'on ne sçauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune.

Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui estoit le sujet du Voyage.

Astolfo, who had a great mind to see Countrys, did not stand much upon entreaty, and immediately there came a fiery Chariot which carry'd the Apostle and the Knight up into the Air; Astolfo being no great Philosopher, was surpriz'd to find the Moon so much bigger than it appear'd to him when he was upon the Earth; to see Rivers, Seas, Mountains, Cities, Forrests, nay, what would have surpriz'd me too, Nymphs hunting in those Forrests; but that which was most remarkable, was a Valley where you might find any thing that was lost in our World, of what nature soever; Crowns, Riches, Fame, and an infinity of Hopes, the time we spend in Play, and in searching for the Philosophers Stone, the Alms we give after our Death, the Verses we present to great Men and Princes, and the Sighs of Lovers.

The English, through a syntactical shift, lightly confuses this, making Folly seem simultaneously absent and present, losing the specific satirical bite of the original.","The English translation uses the term 'Wits' instead of 'Esprits', which can alter the philosophical connotation—'Esprit' in the French Enlightenment context may evoke reason, intellect, or mind, whereas 'wit' in English carries a lighter or more comic sense.","The English translation inserts a long digressive passage with examples of 'Statsemen, Divines, Lawyers,' and a satirical anecdote about judges and magistrates, which are not found in the French. This addition injects topical English social satire, shifting the focus and tone from Fontenelle's original playful self-reflexivity and philosophical jest to pointed commentary on English society. It manipulates the reader's perception by reframing the universal idea through a narrow, culture-specific critique.","The English translation uses the phrase 'Hero's wits are naturally very heavy,' instead of the French 'Esprit de ce Heros estoit de sa nature assez pesant' (the mind/spirit of this hero was by its nature rather heavy). Worth noting, 'cursedly plagu'd to carry it,' intensifies the English tone compared to the more neutral 'eut assez de peine à la porter', subtly changing the connotation to one of hardship and complaint.","The English adapts and expands on the source with a highly poetic, English-style stanza. However, it omits explicit references to the mouth and the act of gathering one's mind/spirit with the lips—turning the image into searching and receiving, and replacing the physical closeness of the original French (suggestive of a kiss) with a more general poetic gesture. This subtly shifts the erotic or intimate connotations and makes the passage less directly sensual.","In the English, 'the safest way of losing our wits, is to be in love... we may recover 'em again at our lips', the source nuance—that one loses their 'esprit' by love and can get it easily back, while philosophical disquisitions send it out of reach to the Moon—is partially maintained but the translation simplifies and compresses the original's playful register and distinction about the irretrievability of the mind when lost to philosophy, subtly altering the intellectual irony.","The English translation shifts from the source's 'Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques' (our vials will be honorably in the philosophical section) to 'our Vials have an honourable Station among the Philosophers, when 'tis forty to one, but Love fixeth our Wits on an Object we cannot but be asham'd of.' This makes an implicit value judgment about the dignity of philosophical vs. romantic distraction and adds the idea of shame, which is not found in the original French, thus shifting the tone and reader's perception."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience?</span></span> De bonne foy, Madame, repliquay-je, je n'en sçay rien. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, &amp; que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; &amp; si d'ailleurs nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eust ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures, qu'on appelle le Genre humain?</span></span> Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eust des passions si folles, &amp; des reflexions si sages; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">une durée si courte, &amp; des veües si longues; tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, &amp; tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes;</span></span> tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, &amp; tant d'inclination à la Servitude; une si forte envie d'estre heureux, &amp; une si grande incapacité de l'estre?

The English omits her impatience entirely, which subtly alters the tone, making the Marquise seem more neutral.","The French carefully sets the condition 'si nous eussions de la raison, & que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes' (if we had reason and yet were not men), and only then supposes the lunar context. The English hurries this logic, omitting the layered conditional and slightly shifting the intellectual exercise by compressing the hypotheticals, which can influence the reader's sense of the philosopher's reasoning.","The French lists 'une durée si courte, & des veües si longues' prior to the 'science' clause, emphasizing the paradox between short life and long plans/desires. The English omits this pair entirely, removing a key contrast in the self-portrait of humanity and thus weakening Fontenelle's original irony.","The French 'nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits' ('we are still guessing how we are made') emphasizes the ongoing, unfinished nature of self-understanding, while the English renders it as 'cannot so much as guess how we were made', shifting the emphasis to an inability or ignorance about origins, which misses the nuance about continual self-examination.","The French 'les Dieux estoient pleins de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes, & que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sens froid, ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire' invokes the gods' amusement specifically on 'regarder leur Ouvrage de sens froid' (looking at their work with a cool head). The English collapses this to 'when they were sober again, could not chuse but laugh at their own handy-work', losing the image of looking with detachment and reducing the irony.","The French refers to 'Habitans de cette grande Terre Australe qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe' (inhabitants of that great southern land which is still entirely unknown to us), highlighting a mysterious, unknown continent, evoking broader, real geographic ignorance. The English flattens this to 'that part of the Earth which is not yet discover'd', thus obscuring the specifically 'Terre Australe' motif, and lessening the sense of tantalizing mystery.","The French underlines 'de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, & qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sçait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font' (from the stern to the bow there is no communication, and at one end of the ship, no one knows what people are at the other, nor what they are doing). The English translation loses the explicitness of 'what people are at the other' end, which in French underscores the total unfamiliarity; the English shifts the focus to 'who lives or what is done at the other end,' which subtly alters the emphasis and diminishes the analogy with the lunar beings."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoistra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas</span></span>, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connoistra jamais, cela est desesperant.

Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste</span></span>. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eust dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Ameriquains plus propres à estre traversées? En verité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous estes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller.</span></span> On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre.</span></span> A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siecles à venir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou.</span></span> Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mestier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont esté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">Les gens de la Lune sçavent peut-estre déja faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sçait quelle surprise.</span></span> Vous estes insuportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celuy-là.

Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez-bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens. Le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous, on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu nostre habitation, il nous sera permis de connoistre celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">Il n'y a que la verité qui persuade, mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves.

You would laugh at me, said I, if I should answer you seriously, perhaps I may deserve it, and yet, I fancy, I can say a great deal to justifie a ridiculous thought that is just now come into my Head; nay to use the Fools best Argument, I'll lay a wager I make you own (in spite of Reason) that one of these days there may be a Communication between the Earth and the Moon, and who knows what great Advantages we may procure by it? Do but consider America before it was discover'd by Columbus, how profoundly ignorant were those People, they knew nothing at all of Arts or Sciences, they went naked, had no other Arms but a Bow and Arrows, and did not conceive they might be carry'd by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a wide Space, forbidden to Man, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing: 'Tis true, after having spent whole years in making hollow the trunks of great Trees with sharp stones, they put themselves to Sea in these Trunks, and floated from Land to Land, as the Wind and Waves drove 'em; but how often was their Trough overset, and they forc'd to recover it again by swimming? So that (except when they were on the Land) it might be said they were continually swimming: And yet had any one but told 'em of another kind of Navigation incomparably more perfect and useful than their own, that they might easily pass over that infinite Space of Water, that they might stop in the middle of the Waves, and in some sense command the Winds, and make their Vessel go fast or slow as they pleas'd; in short, that this impassable Ocean should be no obstacle to their conversing with another different People; do you think they would have believed you? and yet at last that day is come; the unheard of and most surprizing Sight appears, vast great Bodies, with white Wings, are seen to fly upon the Sea, to vomit Fire from all Parts, and to cast on their Shoars an unknown People, all scaled with Iron, who dispose and govern Monsters as they please; carry Thunder in their Hands, and overthrow and destroy whoever resists 'em: From whence came they? Who brought 'em over the Sea? Who gave to 'em the Disposal of the Fire of Heaven? Are they Gods? Are they Sons of the Sun? for certainly they are not Men. Do but consider, Madam, the surprize of the Americans, there can be nothing greater; and after this, shall any one say there shall never be a Communication between the Moon and the Earth. Did the Americans believe there would ever be any between them and Europe, till it came to pass? 'Tis true, you must pass this great Space of Air and Heaven which is between the Earth and the Moon; but did not those vast Seas seem at first as impassable to the Americans? You rave, I think, said she, did you not own the Americans were so ignorant, that they had not the least conception of crossing the Sea; but we who know a great deal more then they, can imagine and fancy the going through the Air, tho' we are assur'd it is not to be done. There is somewhat more than Fancy, I reply'd, when it hath been already practis'd, for several have found the secret of fastning Wings, which bear them up in the Air, to move them as they please, and to fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple; I cannot say indeed they have yet made an Eagles Flight, or that it doth not cost now and then a Leg or an Arm to one of these new Birds; but this may serve to represent the first Planks that were launch'd on the Water, and which were the very beginning of Navigation; there were no Vessels then thought of to sail round the World, and yet you see what great Ships are grown by little and little from those first Planks. The Art of Flying is but newly invented, it will improve by degrees, and in time grow perfect; then we may fly as far as the Moon. We do not yet pretend to have discover'd all things, or that what we have discover'd can receive no addition; and therefore, pray let us agree, there are yet many things to be done in the Ages to come. Were you to live a thousand Ages, said the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, I can never believe you will fly, but you must endanger your Neck. I will not, I reply'd, be so unmannerly as to contradict a fair Lady, but tho' we cannot learn the Art here, I hope you will allow they may fly better in the Moon; 'tis no great matter whether we go to them, or they come to us, we shall then be the Americans, who knew nothing of Navigation, and yet there were very good Ships at t' other end of the World. Were it so, said she, the People in the Moon would have been here before now. All in good time, said I, the Europians were not in America till at the end of some thousands of years, they were so long in improving Navigation to the point of crossing the Ocean. The People in the Moon have already made some short Voyages in the Air; they are exercising continually, and by degrees will be more expert, then we shall see 'em, and God knows how we shall be surpriz'd. It is unsufferable, said she, you should banter me at this rate, and justifie your ridiculous Fancy by such false reasoning. I am going to demonstrate, said I, you reproach me very unjustly: Consider, Madam, that the World is unfolded by degrees; for the Ancients were very positive, that the Torrid and Frigid Zones were not inhabitable, by reason of their excessive Heat and Cold; and in the time of the Romans, the general Map of the World was but very little extended beyond that of their Empire; which tho' in one sense, express'd much Grandeur, in another sense, was a sign of as great Ignorance; however, there were Men found both in very hot and in very cold Countreys; so that you see the World is already encreas'd after that it was thought that the Ocean cover'd the whole Earth, except what was then discover'd; there was no talk then of the Antipodes, not so much as a thought of 'em, for who could fancy their Heels at top, and their Heads at bottom; and yet after all their fine reasoning, the Antipodes were discover'd; here's now another half of the World starts up, and a new Reformation of the Map; methinks this, Madam, should restrain us, and teach us not to be so positive in our Opinions, the World will unfold it self more to us hereafter; then we shall know the People in the Moon as well as we do now the Antipodes; but all things must be done in order, the whole Earth must be first discover'd, and till we are perfectly acquainted with our own Habitation, we shall never know that of our Neighbours. Without fooling, said the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, you are so very profoud in this Point, that I begin to think, you are in earnest, and believe what you say. Not so neither, said I, but I would shew you how easie it is to maintain a chymerical Notion, that may (like some opinions in Religion,) perplex a Man of understanding, but never perswade him; there is nothing perswades but Truth, it hath no need of all its proofs, but enters naturally into our Understanding; and when once we have learn'd it, we do nothing but think of it.

So that (except when they were on the Land) it might be said they were continually swimming: And yet had any one but told 'em of another kind of Navigation incomparably more perfect and useful than their own, that they might easily pass over that infinite Space of Water, that they might stop in the middle of the Waves, and in some sense command the Winds, and make their Vessel go fast or slow as they pleas'd; in short, that this impassable Ocean should be no obstacle to their conversing with another different People; do you think they would have believed you? and yet at last that day is come; the unheard of and most surprizing Sight appears, vast great Bodies, with white Wings, are seen to fly upon the Sea, to vomit Fire from all Parts, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">and to cast on their Shoars an unknown People, all scaled with Iron, who dispose and govern Monsters as they please; carry Thunder in their Hands, and overthrow and destroy whoever resists 'em</span></span>: From whence came they? Who brought 'em over the Sea? Who gave to 'em the Disposal of the Fire of Heaven? Are they Gods? Are they Sons of the Sun? for certainly they are not Men. Do but consider, Madam, the surprize of the Americans, there can be nothing greater; and after this, shall any one say there shall never be a Communication between the Moon and the Earth. Did the Americans believe there would ever be any between them and Europe, till it came to pass? 'Tis true, you must pass this great Space of Air and Heaven which is between the Earth and the Moon; but did not those vast Seas seem at first as impassable to the Americans? You rave, I think, said she, did you not own the Americans were so ignorant, that they had not the least conception of crossing the Sea; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">but we who know a great deal more then they, can imagine and fancy the going through the Air, tho' we are assur'd it is not to be done.</span></span> There is somewhat more than Fancy, I reply'd, when it hath been already practis'd, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">for several have found the secret of fastning Wings, which bear them up in the Air, to move them as they please, and to fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple; I cannot say indeed they have yet made an Eagles Flight, or that it doth not cost now and then a Leg or an Arm to one of these new Birds;</span></span> but this may serve to represent the first Planks that were launch'd on the Water, and which were the very beginning of Navigation; there were no Vessels then thought of to sail round the World, and yet you see what great Ships are grown by little and little from those first Planks. The Art of Flying is but newly invented, it will improve by degrees, and in time grow perfect; then we may fly as far as the Moon. We do not yet pretend to have discover'd all things, or that what we have discover'd can receive no addition; and therefore, pray let us agree, there are yet many things to be done in the Ages to come. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">Were you to live a thousand Ages, said the Countess, I can never believe you will fly, but you must endanger your Neck.</span></span> I will not, I reply'd, be so unmannerly as to contradict a fair Lady, but tho' we cannot learn the Art here, I hope you will allow they may fly better in the Moon; 'tis no great matter whether we go to them, or they come to us, we shall then be the Americans, who knew nothing of Navigation, and yet there were very good Ships at t' other end of the World. Were it so, said she, the People in the Moon would have been here before now.

The English translation slightly inflates this to mean the Earth is 'as good as discover'd', which removes the sense of the unknown and minimizes the effort implied in discovery, thus shifting the tone to make discovery seem trivial.","The translation adds 'and who knows what great Advantages we may procure by it?', inserting utilitarian connotations about possible benefits of communication between Earth and Moon, which are not present in the French, thus subtly altering the speculative, almost whimsical tone of the French passage.","The English omits the French nuance of a thought that is both 'tres-ridicule' and 'aussi impertinente qu'elle est', focusing instead on 'the Fools best Argument' rather than the self-surprise and acknowledged folly of the original thought. This changes the connotative landscape of self-deprecation and surprise.","The French mentions 'Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux', clearly referring to armored strangers with control over unknown monsters, i.e., horses or animals. The English simplifies and flattens this to 'dispose and govern Monsters as they please', losing the specific imagery and implications related to the European conquest and its awe-inspiring effect.","The French 'nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller' is more speculative—'we could very well imagine that one could go through the air, if indeed it was possible'—whereas the English flattens it to 'we ... can imagine and fancy the going through the Air, tho' we are assur'd it is not to be done', which implies a more certain impossibility and adds assurance, subtly shifting the epistemic stance.","The English misses some nuances of the French, which emphasizes 'différentes personnes ... trouvé ... s'ajuster des aîles ... de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre.' The translation summarizes and omits the sense that these are 'premières planches', early stages of flight, instead focusing on the failed eagle's flight and loss of limbs, changing the metaphor from a pioneering comparison to a more comical tone.","The translation changes the Marquise's resigned refusal to grant flight except when breaking one's neck ('je ne consentiray point ... que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou') to 'Were you to live a thousand Ages ... I can never believe you will fly, but you must endanger your Neck.' This removes the inherent sarcasm and replaces it with incredulity and focus on time, subtly altering the tone from playful refusal to disbelief.","The English translation converts 'ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles & plus experimentez, nous les verrons, & Dieu sçait quelle surprise.' (‘they practice; when they are more skilled and experienced, we will see them, and God knows what a surprise!’) into a less vivid and more procedural, future-event formulation where the surprise is less stressed as unexpectedness.","The English 'the World is unfolded by degrees' removes the reflexive, almost agentless unfolding of 'le Monde se développe peu à peu' (the world develops itself little by little), which implies both the world's expansion and the mind's expansion with it, subtly narrowing the philosophical meaning.","The English adds a religious analogy 'may (like some opinions in Religion,) perplex a Man of understanding, but never perswade him', which is not present in the original. This addition introduces an extraneous comparison that may carry additional connotations in the English Enlightenment context regarding belief and persuasion.","The translation rephrases 'Il n'y a que la verité qui persuade, mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans l'esprit, qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois' as 'there is nothing perswades but Truth, it hath no need of all its proofs, but enters naturally into our Understanding; and when once we have learn'd it, we do nothing but think of it.' The French frames truth as something that when learned feels like a memory, which is lost in the translation, removing a subtle philosophical point about cognition and memory."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P029: The Third Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P029: The Third Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P039: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">La Marquise voulut mégager pendant le jour à poursuivre nos Entretiens</span></span>, mais je luy representay que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">nous ne devions confier nos chimeres qu'à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles, puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet</span></span>.

Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint Denis ressemble à Paris.</span></span> Le Soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost un Païs, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mesmes changemens sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voila le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'éleve point de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que nostre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement ou il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoy, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-estre que de grandes cavitez. De la distance ou nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, repliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la verité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantost une partie, tantost une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes. Mais ces mesmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mesmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour estre imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mesmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-mesme, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.)

I cannot suffer it, said she; yesterday you were preparing me to receive a Visit from 'em, and now there are no such People in Nature: Once you would have me believe the Moon was inhabited; I surmounted the Difficulty I had, and will now believe it. You are a little too nimble, I reply'd; did I not advise you never to be entirely convinc'd in things of this nature, but to reserve half of your understanding free and disengag'd, that you may admit of the contrary opinion, if there be any occasion. I care not for your Sentences, said she, let us come to matter of Fact. Are we not to consider the Moon as Greenwhich? No, said I, the Moon doth not so much resemble the Earth, as Greenwich doth London: The Sun draws from the Earth and Water, Exhalations and Vapours, which mounting to a certain height in the Air, do there assemble, and form the Clouds; these uncertain Clouds are driven irregularly round the Globe, sometimes shadowing one Countrey, and sometimes another; he then who beholds the Earth from a-far off, will see frequent alterations upon its surface, because a great Country overcast with Clouds, will appear dark or light, as the Clouds stay, or pass over it; he will see the Spots on the Earth often change their Place, and appear, or disappear as the Clouds remove; but we see none of these changes wrought upon the Moon, which would certainly be the same, were there but Clouds about her; but on the contrary, all her Spots are fix'd and certain, and her light parts continue where they were at first, which truly is a great misfortune; for by this reason, the Sun draws no Exhalations or Vapours above the Moon; so that it appears she is a Body infinitely more hard, and solid than the Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upwards as soon as Heat puts them in Motion: But it must be a heap of Rock and Marble, where there is no Evaporation; besides, Exhalations are so natural and necessary where there is Water, that there can be no Water at all, where there is no Exhalation; and what sort of Inhabitants must those be, whose Countrey affords no Water, is all Rock, and produceth nothing? Very fine, said she, you have forgot since, you assur'd me, we might from hence distinguish Seas in the Moon; nay, You or your Friends were Godfathers to some of 'em. Pray, what is become of your Caspian Sea, and your Black Lake? All Conjecture, Madam, I reply'd, tho' for your Ladyships sake, I am very sorry for it; for those dark places we took to be Seas, may perhaps be nothing but large Cavities; 'tis hard to guess aright at so great a distance. But will this suffice then, said she, to extirpate the People in the Moon? Not altogether, I reply'd, we will neither determine for, nor against them. I must own my weakness (if it be one) said she, I cannot be so perfectly undetermin'd as you would have me to be, but must believe one way, or the other; therefore pray fix me quickly in my opinion; as to the Inhabitants of the Moon; preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit; and yet methinks I have a strange inclination for 'em, and would not have 'em destroy'd, if it were possible to save 'em. You know, Madam, said I, I can deny you nothing; the Moon shall be no longer a Defart, but to do you service, we will repeople her. Since to all appearance, the Spots in the Moon do not change, I cannot conceive there are any Clouds about her, that sometimes obscure one part, and sometimes another; yet this doth not hinder, but that the Moon sends forth Exhalations, and Vapours. Our Clouds which we see in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their coming out of the Earth, were separated into such minute Particles, that they could not be discern'd; but as they ascend higher, they are condens'd by the Cold, and by the re- union of their Parts, are render'd visible; after which they become great Clouds, which fluctuate in the Air, till they return back again in Rain; however these Exhalations and Vapours do sometimes keep themselves so dispers'd, that they are imperceptible; or if they do assemble, it is in forming such subtile Dews, that they cannot be discern'd to fall from any Cloud. It may likewise happen, that the Vapours which go out of the Moon (for it is incredible that the Moon is such a Mass, that all its Parts are of an equal Solidity, all at rest one with another, and all incapable of any alteration from the efficacy of the Sun; I am sure we are yet unacquainted with such a Body: Marble it self is of another Nature, and even that which is most Solid, is subject to Change and Alteration; either from the secret and invisible motion it hath within it self, or from that which it receives from without) it may so happen then, that the Vapours which issue from the Moon, may not assemble round her in Clouds, and may not fall back again in Rain, but only in Dews. It is sufficient for this, that the Air with which the Moon is environ'd, (for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth) be a little different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon a little different from those of the Earth, which is very probable. Hereupon the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than on the Earth, the Effects must be different; tho' it is of no great consequence whether they are or no; for from the moment we have found an inward motion in the parts of the Moon, or produced by foreign Causes, here is enough for the new birth of its Inhabitants, and a sufficient and necessary fund for their Subsistence. This will furnish us with Corn, Fruit, Water, according to the custom or manner of the Moon, which I do not pretend to know; and all proportion'd to the wants and use of the Inhabitants, with whom I pretend to be as little acquainted. That is to say, reply'd the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, you know all is very well, without knowing how it is so, which is a great deal of Ignorance upon a very little Knowledge; however I comfort my self, that you have given the Moon her Inhabitants again, and have wrap'd her in an Air of her own, without which a Planet would seem but very naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: Well, Madam, said I, I have great News for you; that which I told you last Night, of the Moon's being inhabited, may not be so now: There is a new Fancy got into my Head, which puts those People in great Danger.

All Conjecture, Madam, I reply'd, tho' for your Ladyships sake, I am very sorry for it; for those dark places we took to be Seas, may perhaps be nothing but large Cavities; 'tis hard to guess aright at so great a distance. But will this suffice then, said she, to extirpate the People in the Moon? Not altogether, I reply'd, we will neither determine for, nor against them. I must own my weakness (if it be one) said she, I cannot be so perfectly undetermin'd as you would have me to be, but must believe one way, or the other; therefore pray fix me quickly in my opinion; as to the Inhabitants of the Moon; preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit; and yet methinks I have a strange inclination for 'em, and would not have 'em destroy'd, if it were possible to save 'em. You know, Madam, said I, I can deny you nothing; the Moon shall be no longer a Defart, but to do you service, we will repeople her. Since to all appearance, the Spots in the Moon do not change, I cannot conceive there are any Clouds about her, that sometimes obscure one part, and sometimes another; yet this doth not hinder, but that the Moon sends forth Exhalations, and Vapours. Our Clouds which we see in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their coming out of the Earth, were separated into such minute Particles, that they could not be discern'd; but as they ascend higher, they are condens'd by the Cold, and by the re- union of their Parts, are render'd visible; after which they become great Clouds, which fluctuate in the Air, till they return back again in Rain; however these Exhalations and Vapours do sometimes keep themselves so dispers'd, that they are imperceptible; or if they do assemble, it is in forming such subtile Dews, that they cannot be discern'd to fall from any Cloud. It may likewise happen, that the Vapours which go out of the Moon (for it is incredible that the Moon is such a Mass, that all its Parts are of an equal Solidity, all at rest one with another, and all incapable of any alteration from the efficacy of the Sun; I am sure we are yet unacquainted with such a Body: Marble it self is of another Nature, and even that which is most Solid, is subject to Change and Alteration; either from the secret and invisible motion it hath within it self, or from that which it receives from without) it may so happen then, that the Vapours which issue from the Moon, may not assemble round her in Clouds, and may not fall back again in Rain, but only in Dews. It is sufficient for this, that the Air with which the Moon is environ'd, (<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth</span></span>) be a little different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon a little different from those of the Earth, which is very probable. Hereupon the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than on the Earth, the Effects must be different; tho' it is of no great consequence whether they are or no; for from the moment we have found an inward motion in the parts of the Moon, or produced by foreign Causes, here is enough for the new birth of its Inhabitants, and a sufficient and necessary fund for their Subsistence. This will furnish us with Corn, Fruit, Water, according to the custom or manner of the Moon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">which I do not pretend to know; and all proportion'd to the wants and use of the Inhabitants, with whom I pretend to be as little acquainted.</span></span> That is to say, reply'd the Countess, you know all is very well, without knowing how it is so, which is a great deal of Ignorance upon a very little Knowledge; however I comfort my self, that you have given the Moon her Inhabitants again, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">and have wrap'd her in an Air of her own, without which a Planet would seem but very naked.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The source uses a French comparison: 'raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint Denis', meaning 'should we reason about the Moon as we do about Saint Denis?' with the explanation that Saint Denis resembles Paris as the Moon does to Earth. The translation transposes this to 'Are we not to consider the Moon as Greenwich? ... as Greenwich doth London', replacing a French cultural comparison with a British one. This localizes the text to the British context and loses the nuance attached to the Paris/Saint Denis relationship.","The source states it is 'quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable' (something more than probable) that the Moon is surrounded by air particular to itself, just as the Earth is. The translation renders this, with much more certainty, as 'for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth', elevating a suggestion or strong probability to an assurance, shifting the original speculation into a fact.","The French 'J'entends des fruits, des bleds, des eaux à la maniere de la Lune que je fais profession de ne pas connoistre, le tout proportionné aux besoins de ses Habitans que je ne connais pas non plus.' emphasizes that the speaker expressly does not claim to know what these lunar equivalents are, but the English 'which I do not pretend to know; and all proportion'd to the wants and use of the Inhabitants, with whom I pretend to be as little acquainted.' underplays this uncertainty and humility, especially with the ambiguous 'pretend to be as little acquainted', which shades from an honest confession of ignorance to almost playful or affected ignorance.","The source 'il me sembleroit desormais que sans cela une Planete seroit trop nuë' uses the phrase 'seroit trop nuë' as a poetic and understated way to suggest a planet without an atmosphere seems too bare. The translation 'without which a Planet would seem but very naked' uses 'very naked', which is a more emphatic and less nuanced expression than 'trop nuë', potentially altering the delicate connotation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empescher la communication des deux Planetes.

This shifts both the connotation (using 'Faries' instead of the more ambiguous 'Genies') and adds a humoristic, locally specific image, influencing reader perception away from Fontenelle's more universal reference.","'Here then are natural Barricades, which defend the passage out of our World, as well as the Entry into that of the Moon;' changes the tone from the French's 'barrieres naturelles qui nous défendent la sortie de nostre Monde, & l'entrée de celuy de la Lune' (which is more about natural barriers denying passage) to a more militaristic sense with 'barricades defending', which slightly changes the connotation of passive versus active resistance.","'For Example, I will suppose that we may see there the Firmament, the Sun, and the Stars, of another colour than what they are here;' introduces a hypothetical and more personal framing ('I will suppose') not present in the French, which is more assertive ('Je croy, par exemple, qu'il faut qu'on y voye...'). This alters the rhetorical stance and affects the force of the speculation.","'Natural Spectacles' replaces 'espèce de Lunette naturelle' (a kind of natural lens), but 'Spectacles' in English may be interpreted as 'glasses' or even a show, while 'Lunette' refers specifically to a lens or spyglass. This introduces ambiguity and can subtly change the reader's visualization of the metaphor.","No significant manipulation in this segment; metaphorical sense is preserved.","This translation is mostly accurate, with only some minor re-structuring. The manipulation is minimal but the French 'quelques Modernes' (some moderns) is rendered more technically as 'Modern Philosophers.' This introduces a more technical, academic focus which is not explicit in the French.","The phrase 'which if so, the Beams of the Sun and Stars cannot pass through the Air without being ting'd a little with its colour, and losing as much of their own' adds the notion of the beams 'losing as much of their own,' whereas the original only states they take on some of the Air's color. This presents the loss as equivalent, subtly shifting the sense from alteration to an equal exchange.","'Our Air is nothing but a great Mist, which changeth the true colour of the Sky, of the Sun, and of the Stars;' is more categorical than the French 'nostre Air n'est non plus qu'un gros brouillard, qui nous doit alterer la vraye couleur' (our Air is only a great fog, which must alter the true color). The translation shifts from potential ('doit alterer', 'must alter') to actual ('changeth'), giving the statement more certainty.","No significant manipulation; the translation of purity and celestial matter matches the French intent closely.","The translation reorganizes the sentence and omits the nuance of 'cette Lunette au travers de laquelle on voit tout, est changée,' by using 'their Spectacles through which they see every thing are chang'd.' The original makes clear that for the Gens de la Lune (People of the Moon), it's specifically the lens through which one sees everything that is changed, while the translation might leave the impression that the people change their spectacles, implying agency and potentially altering the intended meaning."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer nostre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy.

Venus turns upon her self, and round the Sun, as well as the Moon; they likewise discover by their Tellescopes, that Venus like the Moon, (if I may speak after the same manner) is sometimes new, sometimes full, and sometimes in the wain, according to the diverse situations she is in, in respect of the Earth. </p><p>P039: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">The Moon, to all appearance, is inhabited, why should no Venus be so too?</span></span> You are so full of your Whys, and your Wherefores, says she, interrupting me, that I fancy you are sending Colonies to all the Planets. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">You may be certain, so I will, I reply'd, for I see no reason to the contrary</span></span>; we find that all the Planets are of the same nature, all obscure Bodies, which receive no light but from the Sun, and then send it to one another; their motions are the same, so that hitherto they are alike; and yet if we are to believe that these vast Bodies are not inhabited, I think they were made but to little purpose; why should Nature be so partial, as to except only the Earth? But let who will say the contrary, I must believe the Planets are peopled as well as the Earth. I find, says the Countess, with some concern, a Philosopher will never make a good Martyr, you can so quickly shift your Opinion, 'twas not many minutes since the Moon was a perfect Desart, now the rest of the Planets are inhabited. Why truly, Madam, said I, there is a time for all things, and your true Philosopher believes any thing, or nothing, as the Maggot bites. Had you taken me in the sceptical Vein, I would have as soon granted a Nation in a Mustard Ball, as a living Creature in the Moon; but the tide is turn'd, and all the Planets are Peopled like an Anthill; yet, Raillery apart, this is not so very improbable as you think it; for do you believe we discover, (as I may say) all the Inhabitants of the Earth? there be as many kinds of invisible as visible Creatures; we see from the Elephant to the very Hand-worm, beyond which our Sight fails us, and yet counting from that minute Creature, there are an infinity of lesser Animals, which were they perceptible, would be as little in comparison with a Mite, as a Mite is of an Ox. How lately have our Virtuoso's found out the Pepper Worms, which in the least drop of Water appear like so many Dolphins, sporting in the Ocean; nay, they tell you that the sharpness of Vinegar consists in the fierceness of the little Animals that bite you by the Tongue; not to name the blue on Plums, and twenty Experiments of the like nature.</p>","explanations":["The phrase '(I had like to have said Noise)', the addition of the Rar�e Show example, and 'howl like so many Souls in Purgatory' are not in the original. The French compares the souls to those in despair, but the English adds the Catholic imagery of purgatory (not used by Fontenelle, whose context would tend toward a more neutral or deist afterlife), and includes explanations and examples that shift the meaning and cultural tone. The translation also omits the \"toute leur félicité\" (all their felicity) element's contextual explanation and introduces 'taking pity' on the souls, which is more sentimental than the original.","'Sur Vénus je reprens le Saint Denis' is translated as 'Venus, which puts me again in mind of Greenwich', completely changing the French reference to Paris's Saint Denis (a French context, possibly meaning he's returning to the subject in the manner of Saint Denis) to 'Greenwich', an English astronomical reference. This shifts the geographic and cultural anchor from French to English, subtly anglicizing the narrative for the British reader.","'du moins je vous y ay fait voir tout ce qui estoit de ma connoissance' is translated as 'at least, you have seen all I can shew you.' The English version omits the narrator's admission of the limits of his knowledge, which in French is a gesture of humility and contributes to the Enlightenment ethos of bounded knowledge. The English instead implies only the countess's experience is limited, subtly altering the narrator's tone and self-positioning.","The English says 'The Moon, to all appearance, is inhabited, why should no Venus be so too?' but the French 'la Lune selon toutes les apparences est habitée, pourquoy Vénus ne le sera-t-elle pas aussi?' means 'Why should not Venus also be inhabited?' The target version adds 'no', which slightly implies doubt or a negative presupposition about Venus, subtly shifting Fontenelle's more speculative, open-ended question into a slightly more defensive posture.","In the French, 'ce Pourquoy a une vertu qui suffira pour peupler tout' is a playful, philosophical point about the power of 'Why not?' as a principle of scientific imagination and populating the worlds. The English 'for I see no reason to the contrary' renders this logic flat, omitting the reflection on inquiry and the creative power of hypotheses central to Fontenelle's Enlightenment tone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Une feüille d'Arbre est un petit Monde habité par des Vermisseaux invisibles, à qui elle paroist d'une étenduë immense, qui y connoissent des Montagnes &amp; des Abismes, &amp; qui d'un costé de la feüille à l'autre n'ont pas plus de communication avec les autres Vermisseaux qui y vivent, que nous avec nos Antipodes.</span></span> A plus forte raison, ce me semble, une grosse Planete sera-t-elle un Monde habité. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">On a trouvé jusque dans des especes de pierres tres-dures de petits Vers sans nombre, qui y étoient logez de toutes parts dans des vuides insensibles, &amp; qui ne se nourrissoient que de la substance de ces pierres qu'ils rongeoient.</span></span> Figurez-vous combien il y avoit de ces petits Vers, &amp; pendant combien d'années ils subsistoient de la grosseur d'un grain de sable; &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">sur cet exemple, quand la Lune ne seroit qu'un amas de rochers, je la ferois plûtost ronger par ses Habitans que de n'y en pas mettre.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Enfin tout est vivant, tout est animé : mettez toutes ces especes d'Animaux nouvellement découvertes, &amp; mesme toutes celles que l'on conçoit aisément qui sont encore à découvrir, avec celles que l'on a toûjours veuës, vous trouverez assurément que la Terre est bien peuplée, &amp; que la Nature y a si liberalement répandu les Animaux, qu'elle ne s'est pas mise en peine que l'on en vist seulement la moitié</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Croirez-vous qu'aprés qu'elle a poussé icy sa fecondité jusqu'à l'excés, elle a esté pour toutes les autres Planetes d'une sterilité à n'y rien produire de vivant?</span></span> </p><p>P051: Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë, dit la Marquise, mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planetes, &amp; embarrassée de la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux; car je voy bien que la Nature, selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">Ce n'est pas à l'imagination à prétendre le représenter, répondis-je, elle n'est pas propre à aller plus loin que les yeux.

(Do you believe that after such excessive fertility here, Nature should have been so sterile as to produce nothing alive on all the other planets?) with 'Why then should Nature, which is fruitful to an excess here, be so very barren in the rest of the Planets?', where the rhetorical question is less direct and loses the emphasis on life itself.","The source emphasizes imagination's limit—imagination cannot represent what the eyes cannot see and only a universal view reveals nature's diversity. The target shifts this to assure the addressee to 'trust your Eyes' and 'you will easily perceive,' losing the reflection that imagination has boundaries and diminishing the philosophical subtlety regarding cognitive limits.","The target slightly generalizes 'humane Faces' for 'visages' and changes 'modèle' to 'Model'/'Moulds' losing some nuance, but more importantly, the translation omits the phrase 'il faudroit encore trouver le modele des visages de chaque Famille' (one would still have to find the model of each family's faces), which underscores the layers of variety and is important in Fontenelle's argument about infinite variation.","The translation's 'would soon perceive they were nearer Neighbours than one of the Earth, and one of Saturn;' is less precise than the source, which states that the Moon and Earth are more similar worlds than Earth and Saturn, missing some of the cosmological specificity of 'Mondes plus voisins' (worlds more closely neighboured).","The English 'in the next World, Experience contributes little towards it; and in the next to that, old Men know no more than Children' subtly departs from the French, which specifies that 'plus loin les Vieillards n'en sçavent pas plus que les Enfants' (further away, elders know no more than children), clarifying that this is a logical extension not a physical distance; the English version could be read as a progression of actual worlds instead.","The target inserts 'which by the way, I think, is much the better'—an aside not present in the source, reflecting the translator’s, not Fontenelle's, viewpoint—introducing a commentary that manipulates the impartial observation of happiness/unhappiness in the original.","The phrase 'dans le partage que nous avons fait avec les Habitans des autres Planetes, il ne nous en est écheu que cinq, dont nous nous contentons faute d'en connoitre d'autres' is rendered with a misleadingly collaborative tone in 'the Partition we have made of 'em with the Inhabitants of the other Planets, there are but five fall'n to our share, with which we are well contented', implying a voluntary distribution or mutual arrangement, whereas the French simply states what fate or nature has granted and our ignorance thereof.","The target adds the sentence 'this I confess is on the Borders of Nonsense, but a Man is ne'er the less a Philosopher for being a little obscure, if not unintelligible.', which is not present in the French source. This addition editorializes Fontenelle's speculation, casting it as potentially nonsensical or obscure, and adds a layer of self-mockery which manipulates the tone and subtly undermines the philosophical seriousness of the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux?

The translation invents an anecdote about a Physician influencing dreams, completely omitting the original sentence and its emphasis on the imagination being limited by human experience. Instead, the segment uses an unrelated digression which shifts both tone and meaning.","The sentence about criticizing the Marquise as some peoples critique our paintings (for their lack of imaginative, only human-like forms) is omitted. The translation jumps to the result of continuing the 'Voyage to the other Worlds', erasing Fontenelle's critical (and slightly satirical) reflection on anthropocentrism in imagination, thereby reducing the philosophical undertone of the passage.","The original refers to resigning 'to ignore the appearances of the inhabitants of all these planets, and to be content to guess as best we can, continuing our voyage among the worlds' -- a subtle resignation and ongoing curiosity. The translation compresses this resignation to a bland statement about only guessing at their inhabitants, losing nuances of limitation and wonder.","The French 'Nous en estions à Venus.' (We were at Venus [in our discussion]) is replaced with 'We were come to Venus,' which weakens the sense of a guided, dialogic progression and the continuity of the philosophical conversation.

The French 'Vous m'affligez, dit la Marquise.' conveys a personal, somewhat playful sense of being pained or troubled ('You afflict me'). The English 'I see then, says the Countess...' omits this emotional nuance, making the exchange less intimate and more detached, thereby manipulating the tone and relational dynamic.","The original describes the proper planet as 'jolie, claire, brillante, & qui ait un air galant', emphasizing prettiness, clarity, brightness, and a certain gallant or charming air. The translation adds 'brisk airy Planet' and 'as the Goddess her self', subtly increasing the emphasis on liveliness and divinity, which shifts connotations from social charm to a supernatural brightness, thus manipulating the impression of the planet and the original's gendered/courtly undertone.","This entire passage is heavily manipulated: in French, it is a witty comparison between Venus's inhabitants—composed of Celadons and Silvandres, with ordinary conversations better than the finest in Clelia, and an environment very favorable to love. The English translation introduces ideas and criticisms of contemporary social life ('Bear-Garden', 'Grooms and Chamber Maids', 'Porter and Car-Man a perfect Sir Courtly') and disputes about courtship not present in the original. This both adds information and omits direct references (Celadons, Silvandres, Clelia), altering social context and satirical orientation.","The phrase 'Venus est plus proche que nous du Soleil, & elle en reçoit une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur.' is translated as 'Venus is much nearer than the Earth is to the Sun, from whence she receives a more vigorous and active influence.' The French refers literally to a 'brighter light and more heat'; the English introduces 'a more vigorous and active influence', shifting the meaning from physical properties to abstract influence, thereby subtly changing the scientific connotation and Enlightenment emphasis on natural phenomena."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, interrompit la Marquise, comment sont faits les Habitans de Venus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Ils ressemblent aux Mores Grenadins; un petit Peuple noir, brûlé du Soleil, plein d'esprit &amp; de feu, toûjours amoureux, faisant des Vers, aimant la Musique, inventant tous les jours des Festes, des Danses, &amp; des Tournois.</span></span> Permettez-moy de vous dire, Madame, repliquay-je, que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">vous ne connoissez guere bien les Habitans de Venus.

This subtly alters both the cultural context and tone.","The English version alters the rhetorical structure, transforming a personal criticism ('vous ne connoissez guere bien les Habitans de Venus') into an impersonal statement about the planet. Also, the shift from comparing 'our Moors of Granada' to Laplanders and Greenlanders by 'their coldness and stupidity' is replaced with broader statements: 'Granada in all its Glory, was a perfect Greenland to it,' which implies a complete role reversal and shifts the intended irony from a comparison of peoples to a comparison between locations.

The translation loses the self-reflexive tone and wit of Fontenelle, simplifying the philosophical skepticism.","The French emphasizes that planets only reflect (renvoyer) the light they receive from the Sun and cannot produce it ('ne la peuvent produire'), and includes a more vivid, detailed depiction of the interplay and 'tissus de la plus riche matière' (textiles of the richest material). The English translation introduces the idea that light 'receives several alterations by the way,' which is not present in the French, subtly shifting the physical description of light's journey and possibly misleading the reader about scientific concepts.","The original describes how the discovery of new planets led to a fashionable trend among philosophers, which then influenced the interpretation of sunspots as planets, almost by fashion ('tout le Monde Philosophe n'avoit l'esprit remply d'autre chose, & qu'enfin les nouvelles Planetes s'estoient mises à la mode'). The English omits the sense that it was a fashionable intellectual preoccupation and presents the interpretation of sunspots as planets in a flatter, less socially-aware narrative, thereby altering the tone and context.","The French has 'les Sçavans faisoient leur Cour de ces pretendües Planetes à tous les Princes de l'Europe', indicating that savants were currying favor (or making a courtly show) with various princes through these supposed planets, giving one the name of one prince, another to another; and that there could have been a quarrel over who would be 'maistre des taches' to name them as he pleased. The English slightly alters the narrative by merging the courtly favor already paid and the potential for quarrelling, and weakens the satirical criticism of learned vanity and patronage politics, diluting the social commentary found in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

This shifts the meaning by adding a contemporary comparison (land value speculation) and distracts from the focus on celestial naming rights, introducing economic connotations irrelevant to the original.","'the spots on the Sun are fallen to nothing; the actions of Pensilvania are not half so low' inserts the anachronistic reference to financial speculation and Pennsylvania stocks, which is completely absent from the original. This not only adds contemporary social commentary but shifts the tone to satire, altering the intent of the original scientific explanation.","'paroit aucune' describes long periods with none visible, but the translation says 'disappear as long,' which reads as if the absence is of equal duration to the presence, distorting the sense of unpredictability and irregularity suggested in the French.","The French is more speculative: 'Il y en a tel qui est peut-estre aussi grand que la Terre.' (There are some which may perhaps be as large as the Earth), but the English asserts it more confidently: 'when some of 'em are as big as the Earth.' This strengthens the claim, removing the hedging of 'peut-etre' and altering the level of scientific caution present in the original.","The French gives the alternative: 'l'etenduë de cette grande Mer de lumiere & de feu qu'on appelle le Soleil.' (the extent of this great sea of light and fire which we call the Sun), while the English shifts to 'which they call the Sun', externalizing the act of naming and slightly distancing the narrative voice, whereas the original includes the speaker among those who call it the Sun.","'c'est comme un million de Monts Etna mis ensemble' (it's like a million Mount Etnas put together) is diluted in English to 'like millions of Etna's', omitting the sense of vast singular accumulation expressed in the original.","The English states 'caused by a fault in the Spectacles', which focuses the error on the instrument itself, while the French points to 'quelque chose qui arrive dans les Lunettes' (something occurring in the telescopes), which is less direct and specifies a temporary phenomenon, not a flaw in the instrument as such, subtly changing the cause.","The French 'il ne paroist nullement propre à estre habité. C'est pourtant dommage, l'habitation seroit belle.' (it seems in no way suitable for habitation. It is a pity, though, the dwelling would be beautiful) is shifted in English to 'it cannot be at all proper for habitation; and what pity 'tis not, for how pleasant would it be?' The translator changes 'beautiful' to 'pleasant,' shifting the connotation from aesthetic admiration to comfort or enjoyment, and slightly weakening the sense of loss.","The English version reduces the 'infinite oddities' of planetary motion in the original ('une infinité de bizareries') to 'extravagant ... fancies,' which weakens the scientific implication that our position results in observational confusion and instead makes it sound as though it's a matter of subjective imagination.","The English omits 'qui puisse etre extremement facile' (where the study ... could be extremely easy), and just says 'where the study or knowledge of the Stars is easily obtain'd,' which removes the sense of possibility/conditionality and thus subtly alters the meaning.","While overall faithful, 'ne verroit rien, ny Planetes, ny Etoiles Fixes.

Well, let the World say what it will, go on with your Whirlpools.' The self-ironizing philosophical abandon is downplayed, and the collective surrender to 'Tourbillons' is omitted.","The French 'c'est dommage qu'ils n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet' ('it's a pity they have only whirlpools for object') is translated as 'you shall see the Whirlpools are worthy of these transports', which reverses the sentiment by making 'whirlpools' a worthy subject, rather than suggesting regret that the transports are only for whirlpools.","The French offers a formal explanation: 'un amas de matiere dont les parties sont détachées les unes des autres, & se meuvent toutes en un mesme sens; permis à elles d'avoir pendant ce temps-là quelques petites mouvemens particuliers, pourveu qu'elles suivent toûjours le mouvement general.' The translation loses the nuance of 'petites mouvemens particuliers' (little particular motions), simply having 'every one is allow'd, or has a particular Motion of its own', thereby omitting the diminutive 'little', which describes the scale and importance of these differences in the original.","'Portées dans la matiere celeste' (carried or borne in celestial matter) is rendered 'the Planets are born up by the Celestial Matter,' which uses a more active 'born up' (as if supported from below), changing the less agentive sense of passive movement in the French.","The French presents the process as the mass 'emportant avec soy les Planetes, les fait tourner toutes en un mesme sens autour du Soleil' (carrying the planets with itself in the same direction around the Sun). The translation uses 'bears the Planets along with it, making them all turn after the same manner round the Sun', which subtly lessens the French's sense of compulsion and togetherness in the motion ('en un mesme sens') by introducing 'after the same manner' rather than directly 'in the same direction.'","'Il n'y a pas jusqu'au Soleil qui ne tourne; mais il ne tourne que sur luy-mesme...' ('Even the Sun turns; but it only turns on itself...') becomes 'there is nothing to the very Sun, which does not turn, but he turns on himself because he is just in the middle...', adding 'there is nothing to the very Sun, which does not turn', an awkward and misleading phrase not in the original, and potentially suggesting that 'nothing' in/around the Sun turns, muddling the original's meaning.","'nous nous fismes suivre par la Lune, parce qu'elle se trouva dans l'étenduë de nostre Tourbillon, & tout à fait à nostre bienséance' (we made the Moon follow us because she was found within our vortex, and entirely to our convenience) is rendered 'when we made the Moon follow us, because she was within the reach of our Vortex, and therefore wholly at our dispose', which eliminates the idea of 'convenance' (convenience, propriety), thus removing the undertone of suitability or fittingness present in the original.","'Jupiter... fut plus heureux ou plus puissant que nous' ('Jupiter... was more fortunate or more powerful than us') is translated as 'Jupiter was stronger, or more fortunate than we', which shifts the connotation from 'puissant' (powerful) to 'stronger', which is more physical and less authoritative, muting the layered meaning of social/political power Fontenelle invokes.","'nous qui sommes une Planete principale, croyez-vous que nous l'eussions esté, si nous nous fussions trouvés proches de luy?' (we who are a principal planet, do you think we would have been, had we found ourselves near him?) is rendered as 'no doubt, we, tho' a principal Planet, had had the same Fate, had we been within the Sphere of his Activity', which omits the hypothetical question and certainty/doubt dynamic of the original, changing it to a direct assertion. This removes Fontenelle's playful speculative tone and its underlying philosophical point about chance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes?

Oh, how I should love to see this pleasant sport of Eclipses; for there is not a Day passes but they Eclipse the Sun, or one another; and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">they are so accustom'd to this diversion in Jupiter, that the late Duke of B-m in his Rehersal, brought the dance of Eclipses from that Planet, as now most of our modish Dances come out of France.</span></span></span></span></p>","explanations":["The translation adds an extended reference to 'the late Duke of B-m in his Rehersal, brought the dance of Eclipses from that Planet, as now most of our modish Dances come out of France,' which is not present in the French original. This addition injects a contemporary English theatrical and cultural allusion, thus altering both the tone and the focus, shifting it from a philosophical musing about Jupiter's moons to a satirical comment about English society and French cultural influence.","The French 'elles y sont un sujet de divertissement, & non pas de frayeur, comme en celuy-ci' (Eclipses are a subject of entertainment there, and not of fear, as in ours) is replaced by a satirical aside about English society and French cultural imports, rather than delivering the original contrast between attitudes towards eclipses in Earth and on Jupiter.

The tone shifts subtly, giving the English a more defensive nuance than the original.","The French 'malheur d'estre asservies à tourner autour d'une autre plus importante' (the misfortune of being enslaved to revolve around another more important) is rendered as 'for being forc'd to turn round another Planet of greater consequence.' The translation removes the notion of 'misfortune' and the strong term 'enslaved/aservies,' which downplays the hierarchical, somewhat tragic sense originally intended.","The French suggests simply wishing that the inhabitants of Jupiter's moons would always have that monstrous planet looming over their heads at a small distance, but the English makes an explicit colonial analogy ('so many Colonies under Jupiter's Government; they should receive their Laws and Customs from him'), which introduces ideas of governance and cultural transmission not present in the original, changing the social connotations.","In the French, the Marquise speculates that perhaps the inhabitants' fear of Jupiter serves to replace their lack of fear of eclipses, and that it is necessary to have some other 'sottise' (foolishness). The English makes this a general maxim ('Every one has their due folly; we are afraid of an Eclipse, and they, that Jupiter will fall on their Heads.'), turning a dialogic speculation into a universal statement and downplaying the gentle irony of the original.","The French details Ticho Brahe's specific actions: if he met an old woman or a hare, he believed the day would be unlucky and promptly went home to lock himself in, not daring to begin anything. The English condenses this and loses the sense of superstition preventing the astronomer from 'daring to begin the least thing', making the avoidance sound more rational ('would not meddle with the least Business'), thus softening the original's almost comic depiction of superstition."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit-elle, aprés que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la crainte des Eclipses, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

Also, 'il paroist bien que la Nature a eu en veüe les besoins de quelques Estres vivans' (it seems that Nature had in view the needs of some living beings) is translated as if Nature considered 'the necessities of all animate Beings,' which generalizes the scope from 'some' to 'all,' subtly expanding the intention of Nature implied by Fontenelle.","The French 'Mais attendez, il me semble que Mars, qui est encore plus éloigné du Soleil que la Terre, n'a point de Lune' expresses a sudden realization ('attendez'—wait) by the Marquise. The translation omits this hesitation or interruption and recasts it as an immediate question ('But pray, why has not Mars a Moon too?'), thereby shifting the discourse from a spontaneous realization to a more rhetorical, interrogative style.","The French explicitly describes 'Oyseaux qui sont si lumineux dans les tenebres, qu'on s'en peut servir pour lire' (birds that are so luminous in darkness that they can be used for reading), but the translation introduces the phrase 'in the darkest night,' intensifying the setting and slightly dramatizing the degree of darkness, thus subtly shifting the connotation and imagery."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oyseaux.

'Ce que ... deviendraient' implies a possible transformation or fate, which is softened in the translation.","The literal question 'Enfin qu'en ferons-nous?' ('What shall we do with them?') in French is a playful, philosophical question, as if humans could or should 'do' something with the fixed stars. The translation keeps the literal sense but without the nuance of playful or speculative tone present in the rhetorical French question.","'Vous le devineriez peut-estre, si vous en aviez bien envie, répondis-je.' is translated as 'You may soon guess, said I'. The English omits the conditional and the psychological nuance ('if you really wanted to'), thereby losing the gentle teasing and the implication that curiosity or desire for knowledge is needed.","'on ne prend pas la peine de la compter.' means 'one does not bother to count it', which in the translation becomes 'it is almost beyond Arithmetick.' This translation amplifies the concept into a statement about the limits of arithmetic itself, rather than the more casual sense that the distance is not even worth calculating.","'Il seroit impossible qu'une lumiere qui auroit essuyé une reflexion, & fait deux fois cinquante millions de lieuës, eust cette force et cette vivacité qu'a celle des Etoiles Fixes.' is rendered as 'and it is impossible it should be so clear and strong as the light of a fix'd Star, which cannot but proceed from it self;' — the English shifts to stating as an absolute that the light 'must proceed from itself', whereas the French gives a more reasoned argument for autonomy, emphasizing the improbability rather than the necessity.","'Les voila donc lumineuses par elles-mêmes, & toutes, en un mot, autant de Soleils.' is translated as 'so that in a word, all the fix'd Stars are so many Suns.' The nuanced phrase 'lumineuses par elles-mêmes' (luminous by themselves) that emphasizes their self-generating light is condensed in the English version, slightly altering the philosophical import regarding autonomy and nature of the stars."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P087: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Ne me trompay-je point, s'écria la Marquise, ou si je vois où vous me voulez mener?</span></span> M'allez-vous dire: Les Etoiles Fixes sont autant de Soleils, nostre Soleil est le centre d'un Tourbillon qui tourne autour de luy, pourquoy chaque Etoile Fixe ne sera-t-elle pas aussi le centre d'un Tourbillon qui aura un mouvement autour d'elle?

(This confuses me, troubles me, terrifies me.) The English compresses this into 'I protest it is dreadful', reducing the emotional range and intensity and subtly shifting the tone from existential anxiety to a more generic fear or dismay.","The French 'je ne sçais plus où je suis, je ne suis plus rien.' ('I no longer know where I am, I am nothing anymore.') is rendered as 'I know not where I am, or what will become of me;', omitting the existential 'I am nothing anymore,' which expresses a loss or negation of self, thus muting the depth of the marquise's crisis.","The French emphasizes both increased 'étenduë & profondeur' (extent and depth) and the metaphor 'dans un plus grand air' (in a larger air), but the English says 'in heigth and breadth' and omits the explicit metaphor of breathing 'dans un plus grand air' (in a larger air), instead saying 'breath with more freedom'. This shifts the imagery from spatial expansion and freedom to simply feeling less confined, providing a subtly different tone.","The French 'elle a fait une profusion des richesses qui est tout-à-fait digne d'elle.' ('she has made a profusion of riches entirely worthy of her.') focuses on the worthiness of Nature, whereas 'Nature hath spar'd no cost, even to profuseness,' omits the notion of worthiness, removing a moral or evaluative nuance from the praise of Nature.","'dont le milieu est occupé par un Soleil qui fait tourner des Planetes autour de luy.' means 'the middle is occupied by a Sun which makes the Planets turn around it.' The English says, 'whose several centres are possess'd by a particular Sun, which makes the Planets turn round it.' The translation of 'plusieurs centres' introduces 'particular' not present in the French and subtly individualizes the centers, possibly implying more differentiation than in the original, which saw all filled by a central Sun.","The French specifies: 'ils n'ont garde d'en voir les Planetes qui n'ayant qu'une lumiere foible, empruntée de leur Soleil, ne la poussent point au delà de leur Monde..' (they certainly cannot see the planets, which, having only a weak light borrowed from their Sun, do not send it beyond their own World.) In English, it becomes, 'but perhaps they do not see the Planets, who receiving but a faint light from their Sun, cannot send it beyond their own World.' The introduction of 'perhaps' adds uncertainty where the French is categorical; this subtly undermines the scientific sureness and diminishes the rational speculation of the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P089: Vous m'offrez, dit-elle, une espece de Perspective si longue, que la veuë n'en peut attraper le bout.

Madam, said I, since we are in the humour of mingling amorous Follies with our most serious Discourses, I must tell you, that in Love and the Mathematicks People reason alike: Allow never so little to a Lover, yet presently after you must grant him more; nay more and more, which will at last go a great way: In like manner, grant but a Mathematician one little Principle, he immediately draws a consequence from it, to which you must necessarily assent; and from this consequence another, till he leads you so far (whether you will or no) that you have much ado to believe him.

This addition introduces a philosophical connotation about Love's resilience to fate that subtly shifts the tone from humorous to speculative, which manipulates the original light tone.","The conditional logic in the English ('if ... then by consequence, it must ...') makes the astronomic argument appear stronger and more deterministic than in the French, which raises the question as to whether this is an 'absolute necessity'. By tightening the logic, the translation overstates the certainty present in the original, which is more tentative.","The phrase 'no bigger than a small fix'd Star' is not in the French. The French is 'comme une petite Etoile Fixe' ('like a small fixed star'), but 'no bigger than' stresses diminution in a way that shifts the perception from resemblance to relative size. The translation also omits 'qui se montre à eux seulement pendant leurs nuits' ('which is shown to them only during their nights'), slightly diminishing the recurring and periodic aspect of visibility.","The translation changes 'il efface tout' ('he blots out/erases everything') to 'it darkens and hinders us from seeing any other light', making the effect soft instead of total. The poetic image of being 'attached' to the celestial vault and forming part of 'some Bear or Bull' (presumably Ursa Major or Taurus) is slightly muted in the English, as 'fastened ... where it makes a part of some Bear or Bull' fails to express being incorporated into a constellation in the same way.","The translation 'every Sun is single, and there is but one to be seen; but every where else, they serve only to make a number' rephrases the French. The French expresses that in their world they are 'unique of their species', and elsewhere they 'only serve to make up the numbers' (implying anonymity), while 'single...but everywhere else, they serve only to make a number' blurs uniqueness and numerical quantity, thus shifting connotation from uniqueness/species to mere numerical individuality."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est de deviner.

The French 'graine de Mondes' (literally 'seed' or 'swarm of worlds') is more vivid and implies multitude and potential, while 'cluster' is more neutral and conventional, reducing the original's imaginative connotation.","The French refer to 'douze mille petites Isles ou Bancs de Sable' ('twelve thousand little islands or sandbanks'), but the translation omits 'little islands' and simply says 'those twelve thousand banks of Sand', losing the imagery of 'islands' that gives a more dynamic and populated picture.","The French suggests 'on pourroit se parler, ou mesme se donner la main' (one could talk from one world to another, or even shake hands), implying proximity and communication.

The translation 'are excepted out of that general Rule' makes this sound like a systematic, formal exemption rather than an apparent or presumed exception, shifting tone from tentative observation to assertive statement.","'vous n'avez jamais de nuit' literally means 'you never have night', with straightforward certainty. The translation 'for the truth is, you would never have any Night at all' introduces a rationalizing phrase 'for the truth is', making the narrator sound more didactic than the original's simply descriptive tone.","The French 'si on leur disoit qu'il y a des malheureux qui ont de veritables nuits, qui tombent dans des tenebres tres-profondes, & qui quand ils joüissent de la lumiere, ne voyent mesme qu'un seul Soleil' puts focus on 'malheureux' (unfortunates) who 'fall into very deep darkness', and 'even in the light see but one sun'. The translation condenses this to 'there are a miserable sort of People, who where they live, have very dark Nights, and when 'tis Day with them, they never see more than one Sun', diluting the emotive, tragic element of 'malheureux' and omitting 'fall into very deep darkness', which lessens the sense of deprivation.","'Ils nous regarderoient comme des Estres disgraciez de la Nature, & fremiroient de l'horreur de nostre condition' is translated as 'certainly they would think Nature had very little kindness for us, and would tremble with horrour, to think what a sad condition we are in.' The French 'Estres disgraciez de la Nature' means 'beings disfavored/disgraced by Nature', which is more severe than 'Nature had very little kindness for us'.

Il est pourtant vray qu'ils agissent aussi les uns contre les autres.' explains that the rotations engage with each other as watch gears, mutually helping but also acting against each other; the English renders this as 'they mutually help one anothers motion: And yet 'tis true, that they act contrary to one another.'—'act contrary' is less precise than the mutual interlocking and occasional opposition described by 'ils agissent aussi les uns contre les autres', which suggests a more dynamic and nuanced interaction.","The English introduces a foot-ball (bladder) metaphor—'Every World, as some say, is like a Foot-ball, made of a Bladder, cover'd with Leather, which sometimes swells of its own accord, and would extend it self, if it were not hindred.'—which is not present in the French ('un Ballon qui s'enfle de soy-mesme').

'Justling' distances the translation from the sense of 'combat' (struggle), and 'keeps up the trade' suggests a maintenance or ongoing exchange, rather than the creation or causation implied in the original.

The source only states that the illumination is not yet well explained, and that it will be guessed when possible, not promising a future explanation from the speaker. This subtly alters the sense of authorial distance and knowledge implied in the original.","The translator amplifies and specifies 'affright all the Inhabitants of it,' which adds a concrete group (inhabitants) fearing Saturn, not explicit in the French; the French only wishes Saturn would go take on a 'tail or beard' and 'spread terror' in another vortex, making the fearful parties less explicit and thus maintaining more ambiguity and literary subtlety.","The English intensifies and personalizes the event: 'how rude and violent the Shock is, when two Vortex's justle one another, a poor Planet must needs be terribly shaken, and its Inhabitants in no better condition,' which is a stronger and more explicit description than the French, which merely says a planet is 'agitée assez rudement' (rather shaken) and its inhabitants 'ne s'en portent pas mieux' (are none the better for it). The tone in English exaggerates the disturbance and the misfortune of the inhabitants.","The English '’Tis better for him ... not to go out of our Vortex' loses the nuance of caution in the French 'il vaut mieux pour luy ... qu’il ne sorte point de notre Tourbillon', which implies a prudent avoidance rather than a simple statement of what is better. The English flattens the original's tone.","The phrase 'c'est la Comete elle-même qui est bien malheureuse' (it is the comet itself that is truly unfortunate) is shifted in English to 'but ’tis the Comet that is in an ill case', which downplays the existential misfortune (malheureuse) of the comet and instead uses a more medicalized or situational idiom, subtly changing the tone and connotation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P104: Il ne faut donc plus songer, luy dis-je, à vous donner de la pitié pour les habitans d'une Comète, mais j'espere du moins que vous plaindrez <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">ceux qui vivent dans un Tourbillon dont le Soleil vient à s'éteindre</span></span>, &amp; qui demeurent dans une nuit éternelle. Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumiere; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; car que faire sans Soleil? Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? Je vous diray si vous voulez, répondis-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">ce que disent de fort habiles gens</span></span>, que les Etoiles fixes qui ont disparu ne se sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est à dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mesmes, tantost ils nous presentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantost la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoistre, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons-nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mesmes? Vous estes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en vostre faveur. Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantost plus grandes, tantost plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus legers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur, il y a des Etoiles fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroistre &amp; disparoistre, &amp; enfin disparoissent entierement, des demi Soleils reparoîtroient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoistroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoistre de longtemps. Prenez vostre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'estre visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">la Marquise</span></span>, luy qui est en luy-mesme une source de lumiere? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, répondis-je, nostre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des broüillards, ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces taches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toujours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Nous l'avons déja même échepée belle, dit-on</span></span>. Le Soleil a esté tres-pasle pendant des années entieres, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'estoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire, la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa; mais si elle eust continué, nous estions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je sçay les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pasle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris-je: Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changemens: soit lents, soit prompts, mais toujours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens estoient plaisans de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoyent pas encore vû changer. Avoyent-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'experience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se laissoient des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoyent suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela elles diroient, nous avons toûjours vû le mesme Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours esté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroistroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir nostre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque-autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses mêmes qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attens bien que s'il disparoist des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroist de nouvelles, il faut que l'espece se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir esté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démeslez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je croy aisément que tout cela peut estre, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir esté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir esté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différens, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondemens d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naistre &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'estes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage</span></span>.

How? cry'd the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, can Suns be put out? Yes, without doubt said I, for People some thousand years ago saw fix'd Stars in the Sky, which are now no more to be seen; these were Suns which have lost their Light, and certainly there must be strange Desolation in their Vortex's, and a general Mortality over all the Planets, for what can People do without a Sun? This is a dismal Fancy, said the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, I would not if I could help it, let it come into my head. I will tell you if you please, I reply'd, what in this particular is the Opinion of Learned Astronomers. They think that the fix'd Stars which have disappear'd, are not quite extinguish'd, but that they are half Suns, that is, they have one half Dark, and the other half Light, and turning round upon their own Axis or Centre, they sometimes shew us their Light side, and afterwards turning to us their Dark side, we see them no more. To oblige you Madam, I will be of this Opinion, because it is not so harsh as the other, but I cannot make it good, but in relation to some certain Stars, because as some have lately observed, those Stars have their Regulated times of appearing, and disappearing, otherwise there could be no such thing as half Suns. But what shall we say of Stars, which totally disappear, and never shew themselves again after they have finish'd their Course of turning round upon their own Axis? you are too just Madam to oblige me to believe that such Stars are half Suns. However I will try once more what I can do in favour of your Opinion; the Suns are not extinct, they are only sunk so low into the immense depth of Heaven, that we cannot possibly see them, in this Case the Vortex follows his Sun and all's well again. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fix'd Stars have not this motion, by which they remove themselves so far from us, because at other times they might return again nearer to us, and we should see them sometimes greater, and sometimes less, which never happens. But we will suppose that none but the Little, Light, and most Active Vortex's which slip between the others make certain voyages, after which they return again, while the main body of Vortex's remain unmov'd. 'Tis likewise very strange that some fix'd Stars shew themselves to us, spending a great deal of time in appearing, and disappearing, and at last, totally and entirely disappear. Half Suns would appear again at their set and regulated time. Now Madam, boldly declare your Opinion; Must not these Stars of necessity be Suns which are so much darkned as not to be visible to us, yet afterwards shine again, and at last are wholly extinct? How can a Sun said the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, be darkned, and quite extinguish'd, when it is in its own Nature a Fountain of Light? It may be done Madam, said I, with all the ease in the world, if Desc�rtes Opinion be true, that our Sun hath Spots; now whether these Spots be Scum or thick Mists, or what you please, they may thicken and unite, till at last they cover the Sun with a Crust, which daily grows thicker, and then Farewell Sun. We have hitherto scap'd pretty well; but 'tis said, that the Sun for some whole years together hath look'd very pale; for Example, the year after Caesar's death; it was this Crust that then began to grow, but the force of the Sun broke and dissipated it; had it continued, we had been all lost People. You make me tremble, reply'd the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>; and now I know the fatal consequences of the Sun's paleness, I believe, instead of going every morning to my Glass, to see how I look, I shall cast my Eyes up to Heaven, to see whether or no the Sun looks pale. Oh, Madam, said I, there is a great deal of time required to ruine a World. Grant it, said she, yet 'tis but time that is required. I confess it, said I; all this immense mass of Matter that composes the Universe, is in perpetual motion, no part of it excepted; and since every part is moved, you may be sure that changes must happen sooner or later; but still in times proportioned to the Effect. The Ancients were pleasant Gentlemen, to imagine that the celestial Bodies were in their own nature unchangeable, because they observed no change in them; but they did not live long enough to confirm their opinion by their own experience; they were Boys in comparison of us. Give me leave, Madam, to explain my self by an Allegory: If Roses, which last but a day, could write Histories, and leave Memoirs one to another; and if the first Rose should draw an exact Picture of their Gardiner, and after fifteen thousand Rose-Ages, it should be left to other Roses, and so left still to those that should succeed, without any change in it; should the Roses hereupon say, we have every day seen the same Gardiner, and in the memory of Roses, none ever saw any Gardiner but this; he is still the same he was, and therefore certainly he will never die, as we do; for there is no change at all in him. Would not these Roses, Madam, talk very foolishly? and yet there would be more reason in their discourse, than there was in what the Ancients said concerning celestial Bodies; and tho' even to this very day there should appear no visible change in the Heavens, and the matter of which they are made, should have all the signs of an eternal duration without any change; yet I would not believe 'em unchangeable, till I had the experience of many more Ages. Ought we, who last but a moment, make our continuance the measure of any other things duration; 'tis not so easie a matter to be eternal. To have lasted many Ages of Men, one after another, is no sign of Immortality. Truly, says the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, I find the Worlds are far from being able to pretend to it; I will not do 'em so much honour, as to ompare 'em to the Gardiner that lived so much longer than the Roses: I begin to think 'em like the Roses themselves, which blow one day, and die the next: For now I understand, that if old Stars disappear, new ones will come in their room, because every species must preserve it self. No species, Madam, said I, can totally perish; some perhaps will tell you, that such new Stars are Suns, which return to our sight again, after they have been a long time hid from us, in the profundity of Heaven: Others may tell you, they are Suns cleared from that thick crust, which once covered them: If I should think all this possible, yet I likewise believe that the Universe may be framed in such a manner, that from time to time it may produce new Suns; why may not that matter which is proper to make a Sun, be dispers'd here and there, and gather it self again at long run, into one certain place, and lay the foundation of a new World? I am very much inclin'd to believe such new productions, because they suit with that glorious and admirable Idea which I have of the works of Nature. Can we think that wise Nature knows no more than the secret of making Herbs and Plants live and die by a continual revolution? I am verily perswaded, and are not you so too, Madam? that Nature, without much cost or pains can put the same secret in practice, upon the Worlds. I now find, says the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">Countess</span></span>, the Worlds, the Heaven, and celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am come to my self again. To come the better again to our selves, I reply'd, let us say no more of these Matters. We are arrived at the very roof and top of all the Heavens; and to tell you whether there be any Stars beyond it, you must have an abler Man than I am; you may place Worlds there, or no Worlds, as you please: 'Tis the Philosopher's Empire to describe those vast invisible Countries, which are, and are not, or are such as he pleases to make 'em: It is enough for me, to have carried your mind as far as you can see with your Eyes.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P083: You have no reason then, said I, to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, yet I suppose you will think their Condition lamentable, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">who inhabit a Vortex whose Sun comes in time to be quite extinguished</span></span>, and consequently live in Eternal Night.

The English adds an element of inevitability ('comes in time to be') instead of the source's more neutral 'whose Sun [is] extinguished', subtly shifting the sense of time and fate.","The French 'nous l'avons déja même échepée belle, dit-on' (we have already escaped it by a narrow chance, as they say) is rendered in English as 'We have hitherto scap'd pretty well; but 'tis said'. The translation downplays the sense of narrow escape and implicit warning in the source, making the historical astronomical reference feel less urgent and less precarious.","The French phrase questions whether Nature's sole secret is to make herbs and plants live and die: 'N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naistre & mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle?', implying that Nature certainly has more profound secrets. The English 'Can we think that wise Nature knows no more than the secret of making Herbs and Plants live and die by a continual revolution?' introduces 'wise Nature' (not present in the source), adding a slightly ironic or quizzical tone that is not explicit in the French.","The French asserts that Nature 'pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, & qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage' (Nature applies the same secret to worlds, and it costs her no more effort). The English renders this as 'without much cost or pains can put the same secret in practice, upon the Worlds,' weakening the certainty and ease suggested by 'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage' ('it costs her not a bit more'), and sounding less definitive about Nature's abilities.","'Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, repliquay-je, n'en parlons plus', which is urging an even more complete move onward, is translated as 'To come the better again to our selves, I reply'd, let us say no more of these Matters.' The English imposes a more self-reflexive, internal process ('to come better again to ourselves'), which changes the tone of the transition.","The French 'voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux' literally means 'you have arrived at the last vault of the heavens', using architectural/celestial imagery. The English 'We are arrived at the very roof and top of all the Heavens' changes the imagery to a 'roof and top', making it sound more physical and less metaphysical, and also changes the subject from 'you' (second person) to 'we', shifting the speaker's stance and the dynamic between the characters."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la teste tout le systeme de l'Univers!

The translation 'you are pretty knowing' is more colloquial and understates the rational, modest tone of the French, potentially altering the humility and measured praise intended by Fontenelle.","The original French highlights the Marquise's freedom 'de ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra' (to believe nothing of all I've told you as soon as you feel like), emphasizing complete liberty and the arbitrary nature of her belief. The translation 'with the advantage of believing, or not believing any thing I have said' lessens this nuance, missing the immediacy and whimsical freedom implied by 'dés que l'envie vous en prendra,' subtly shifting the tone away from Fontenelle's playful encouragement of independent judgment."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: FIN</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P085: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P085: FINIS.</p>","explanations":[]}],"counts":{"manual":69,"ai":343}}
