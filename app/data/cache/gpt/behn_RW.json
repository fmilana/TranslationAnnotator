Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante.</span></span> Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes.</span></span> Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet.</span></span> Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée. Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle. Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, répliquai-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day? I confess, said she, the Day must yield to such a Night; the day which resembles a fair Beauty, which though more sparkling, is not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night. You are very generous, Madam, said I, to give the advantage to the brown, you who are so admirably fair your self: Yet without dispute, day is the most beautiful thing in Nature; and most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair. But, said she, Beauty is insipid, if it want the pleasure and power of charming; and you must acknowledge that the brightest day that ever you saw could never have engaged you in so agreeable an Ecstasie, as you were just now like to have faln into by the powerful attractions of this Night.</p> <p>P004: I agree to what you say, Madam, said I, but I must own at the same time, that a Beauty of your complexion would give me another sort of transport than the finest Night with all the advantages obscurity can give it.</p> <p>P005: Though that were true, said she, I should not be satisfied; since those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other. How comes it, that Lovers who are the best Judges of what is pleasing and touching, do always address themselves to the Night, in all their Songs and Elegies? I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that? The silence and gloom of the Night, said I, inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing. Besides, the Scene of the Universe by day-light appears too Uniform, we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts. Sir, replied Madam la Marqueise, I have always felt those effects of Night you tell me of, I love the Stars, and could be heartily angry with the Sun for taking them from my sight. Ah, cry'd I, I cannot forgive his taking from me the sight of all those Worlds that are there. Worlds, said she, what Worlds? And looking earnestly upon me, asked me again, what I meant? I ask your Pardon, Madam, said I, I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness. What weakness, said she, more earnestly than before? Alass, said I, I am sorry that I must confess I have imagined to my self, that every Star may perchance be another World, yet I would not swear that it is so; but I will believe it to be true, because that Opinion is so pleasant to me, and gives me very diverting Idea's, which have fixed themselves delightfully in my Imaginations, and 'tis necessary that even solid Truth should have it's agreeableness. Well, said she, since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it; I will believe whatever you please concerning the Stars, if I find it pleasant. Ah, Madam, said I, hastily, it is not such a Pleasure as you find in one of Mullier's Plays; it is a Pleasure that is-I know not where, in our Reason, and which only transports the Mind. What, replied she, do you think me then incapable of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind? I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars. Ah, Madam, cry'd I, I shall never indure to be reproach'd with that neglect of my own happiness, that in a Grove at ten a Clock of the Night, I talk'd of nothing but Philosophy, to the greatest Beauty in the World; no, Madam, search for Philosophy some where else.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description, which I cannot well avoid, the fineness of it leading me so necessarily to it. </p><p>P003: The Moon was about an hour high, which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, and checker'd the Paths beneath with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light; there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed: These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation; but the Presence of a Person of her Wit and Beauty hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars.

The translation makes more explicit the comparison: 'the day which resembles a fair Beauty ... not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night,' explaining the metaphor for English readers and making the implied emblematic comparison explicit.","'les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes' (‘heroines of novels, who are what is most beautiful in imagination, are almost always blond’) is made more explicit in translation by specifying: 'most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair.' The English expands on what makes heroines ideal (the 'most perfect Idea fancy can represent'), making the implied idealization in the French explicit.","The French says: 'Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet' – ‘I wish that the day, since the Blondes are supposed to be on its side, would also have the same effect.’ The English explicates: 'since those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other,' making the analogy between fair beauties and day, and their lack of the same emotional effect, explicit for the English reader.","The French: 'le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, & une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, & disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, & un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.' The translation makes explicit the 'Uniform scene' by adding: 'we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts.' This spells out the contrast between day and night, expands on the effect on imagination, and makes the implicit agency of the starry scene on reverie fully explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder.

Du lieu où vous êtes à l'Opéra, vous ne voyez pas le Théâtre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à votre veue ces roues &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvements. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner comment tout cela joue. Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté.

Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien qu'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers</span></span>; car <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles.

L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton.</span></span> L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas.

Another, That Phaeton is composed of certain Numbers, which make him mount upwards. The third-That Phaeton has a certain kindness for the highest Part of the Theatre, and is uneasie when he is not there. And a fourth-That Phaeton was not made for flying, but that he had rather fly, than leave the upper part of the Stage void: Besides a hundred other Notions, which I wonder have not intirely ruined the Reputation of the Ancients.

I have known several esteem it less since they believed they knew it better; and for my part, said she, I esteem it more since I knew it is so like a Watch: And 'tis most surprising to me, that the course and order of Nature, how ever admirable it appears to be, moves upon Principles and Things that are so very easie and simple.

Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen.</span></span> Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages</span></span>, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries.</span></span> L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien.</span></span> Et <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides.</span></span> Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution.</span></span> Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule.</span></span> Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs.</span></span> Cependant <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation.</span></span> Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire.</span></span> Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy. </p><p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il? Avez-vous remarqué, lui répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? Elle va vers le but où elle est envoyée, &amp; en même temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-même, en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut. La Terre fait la même chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures. Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le côté où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse. Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la même cause. Les Planètes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nôtre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planètes marchent aussi; cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard, &amp; nous fait paroître dans leur cours des bizarreries dont il n'est pas nécessaire que je vous parle. Il suffit que vous sachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irrégulier dans les Planètes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont notre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fond elles sont toutes très-reglées. Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, on ne l'a guere ménagée, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité.. Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures. </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'un gros Navire monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises? Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes. Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fût cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matière céleste, &amp; ne pas s'y laisser emporter? C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature</span></span>. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">saving</span></span>, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</p> <p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">(which is not near the South or North-Poles)</span></span> loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy.

No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation.</span></span> Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died.</span></span> Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","explanations":["The translation adds that the shepherds of Astraea 'had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature', where the French only referenced the 'dangerous' sort of 'bergerie' (pastoral life) in passing. The translator makes explicit the implication that the legendary shepherds' activities were more romantic and less scientific, clarifying the contrast for the English reader.","The target makes explicit the implied causality: 'for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use' and adds a clarifying example with the Philosopher's answer, which is condensed in the French. The expansion details and explicitly connects the folly of assuming nature is for human use with the specific astronomical example, making the connection more overt than in the French.","The English specifies 'by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature,' making explicit that the interwoven circles were explanations for the apparent irregularities ('all the irregular Phaenomena's'), whereas the French only says they used the circles to 'sauver toutes ces bizarreries' (save all these oddities). The translation explains what those 'oddities' refer to.","The translation says, 'and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars', making explicit what 'ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus' refers to, namely that these are the superfluous spheres above the fixed stars invented by the ancients.","The English adds the connective phrase, 'and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal,' making explicit that this was an immediate and recurring process, clarifying the implied proliferation of crystal spheres in response to new discoveries. The French gives only 'Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal.' The explicitness and context are expanded.","The English explains, 'there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams,' making explicit both requirements (transparency and solidity), while the French simply says they needed to be solid and let light pass through. The English spelling out the logic of transparency for light transmission and the analogy of 'solid Beams' as a further specification is explicitation.","The English expands: 'Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence.' The French had only 'Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante... C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, & l'épargne dans l'execution.' The translation adds an explicit evaluative comment about 'nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence.'","The English spells out, 'But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful.' The French simply notes that people invert Nature's order in design and execution, while the English explicates what is meant by this inversion and adds the example of 'ten times a greater Charge'.","The English explicitly draws the comparison: 'Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors:' Whereas the French just notes that people are less jealous of precedence in the universe than in a room and that the precedence of two planets is not such a big deal as that of two ambassadors. The English expands and dramatizes the comparison.","The English clarifies motivation and psychology, spelling out: 'Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation.' The French is more implicit about the pride and flattery.","The English makes explicit the reason and the manner of Copernicus's death as an act of avoidance: 'That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died.' The French just says 'Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, & se tira habilement d'affaire.' The English version spells out that his death was a means of avoiding opposition and adds commentary, making the implication unmistakable."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P011: Mais, répliqua-t-elle encore, comment la Terre avec tout son poids se soûtient- elle sur votre matiere celeste qui doit être bien legere, puisqu'elle est si fluide?

Here, the translator makes the implicit metaphor explicit by describing the Earth as a 'Humming-Top', clarifying to the reader that the Earth is imagined as a spinning toy, which adds detail to the originally subtle metaphor.","The original French lists different faces and then mentions seeing hats, turbans, hairy heads, shaven heads, steepled cities, cities with spires topped by crescents, porcelain-towered cities, lands with only huts, seas, and deserts, etc. The English translation explicates several things: for 'des têtes cheveluës', it says 'there Hands cover'd with Wool' (an unexplained addition possibly referring to a specific ethnic or traditional headwear, or perhaps a translation confusion with 'cheveluës'), and for 'des Villes à longues aiguilles qui ont des Croissants', the translator unpacks this as 'long small-pointed Pyramids, and Half-moons on their tops,' making the reference to Islamic architecture (mosques with minarets and crescents) more explicit. The summary sentence 'all the Variety that is to be seen upon the Face of the Earth' spells out the meaning of the previously poetic 'toute cette variété infinie qui est sur la surface de la Terre.'","The French describes 'dans le même lieu où nous sommes à present, je ne dis pas dans ce Parc, mais dans ce même lieu, à le prendre dans l'air' (the same place where we now are, not this Park, but the same place, considered in the air, there continually pass other peoples who take our place, and at the end of twenty-four hours we return). The English makes this spatial movement more explicit by saying '(I do not mean this Park, but that space of Air which our Bodies fill) several other Nations must successively pass, and we return hither, in twenty four hours, to our own place again.' The phrase 'that space of Air which our Bodies fill' clarifies to the English reader the abstract spatial concept hinted at but never explained in the French, making the cosmic context more explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.

The English translation makes explicit that she is 'to be plain' and wishes to 'keep none of my Doubts,' and explicitly wonders if Nature would not have 'taken care to have given us some sensible Sign, by which we might discover the turning round of so vast a Body,' expanding the hypothetical expectation and making the implicit logic of her doubt explicit.","The French has, 'cela s'appelle bâiller.

The English, however, explicates her reasoning and agency: 'my Lady Marquiese, whose Judgment and Understanding is solid and penetrating,' giving her more intellectual authority, and makes the aims and limitations of defending Earth's immobility as 'undertake that Argument' explicit, also more precisely spelling out the logic that it is improper to persuade another to believe it.

The translation expands this considerably, spelling out explicitly that the guests 'might have prolong'd their Visit till the next Day; but they were so civil, as not to do it', making the customs and the relief at their departure clear, whereas the French is more implicit and condensed.","The French simply states 'elle voulut que je la menasse a quelque chose de nouveau. Et bien donc, luy dis-je, puisque le Soleil,...' while the English clarifies motivations and connections: 'but press'd me to lead her to something that was new. Well, said I, since the Sun, which is now immoveable, and no longer a Planet; and that the Earth, that moves round the Sun, is now one, be not surpriz'd if I tell you, the Moon is another Earth, and is, by all appearance, inhabited.' The English spells out the Copernican logic much more explicitly, where the French allows more for inference.","The French 'Je ne prens parti dans ces choses-là que comme on en prend dans les Guerres Civiles, où l'incertitude de ce qui peut arriver, fait qu'on entretient toûjours des intelligences dans le party opposé, & qu'on a des ménagemens avec ses Ennemis mêmes.' becomes, in English: 'I concern my self no further in these Matters, than Men use to do in Civil Wars; where the Uncertainty of what may be, makes People still entertain a Correspondence with the adverse Party: As for me, tho' I see the Moon inhabited, I live very civilly with those that do not believe it; and I carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, upon occasion, with Honour go over to their side who have the better; but still they gain some considerable Advantage over us.' The translation makes explicit the implications of social and intellectual caution, breaking down the analogy piece by piece for the reader.","The French says 'notre Saint-Denis c'est la Lune, & chacun de nous est ce Bourgeois de Paris, qui n'est jamais sorty de sa Ville.' The English recasts this more fully: 'The Moon is our St. Denis, and we the Citizens of Paris, that never went out of our own Town.' The explication identifies 'we' as 'Citizens of Paris', removing ambiguity and clarifying the analogy.","The French 'car s'il faut que la Lune ressemble en tout à la Terre, vous voilà dans l'obligation de croire la Lune habitée. J'avoüe, répondit-elle, qu'il n'y aura pas moyen de s'en dispenser, & je vous vois un air de confiance qui me fait déjà peur. Les deux mouvements de la Terre, dont je ne me fusse jamais doutée, me rendent timide sur tout le reste' is translated as 'for if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth, you are oblig'd to believe that the Moon is inhabited. I acknowledge, said she, if you do that, I must yield; and your Looks are so assur'd, that you frighten me already: The two different Motions of the Earth, which wou'd never have enter'd into my Thoughts, make me very apprehensive of all you say.' The English brings out the logical necessity and emotional response more explicitly—'I must yield' is more direct than 'il n'y aura pas moyen de s'en dispenser', and 'make me very apprehensive of all you say' is more explicit about her state of mind than 'me rendent timide sur tout le reste'."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere du Soleil?

La lumiere est composée de petites balles qui bondissent sur ce qui est solide, &amp; retournent d'un autre côté, au lieu qu'elles passent au travers de ce qui leur presente des ouvertures en ligne droite, comme l'air ou le verre. Ainsi ce qui fait que la Lune nous éclaire, c'est qu'elle est un Corps dur &amp; solide, qui nous renvoye ces petites balles. Or je croy que vous ne contesterez pas à la Terre cette même dureté e&amp; cette même solidité. Admirez donc ce que c'est que d'être posté avantageusement.

Je ne vous conseille pas d'entreprendre d'y rien réformer, répondis-je, il vaut mieux que vous acheviez de vous convaincre de l'entiere ressemblance de la Terre &amp; de la Lune. Représentez-vous ces deux grandes Boules suspendües dans les Cieux. Vous savez que le Soleil éclaire toûjours une moitié des Corps qui sont ronds, &amp; que l'autre moitié est dans l'ombre. Il y a donc toûjours une moitié, tant de la Terre que de la Lune, qui est éclairée du Soleil, c'est à dire, qui a le jour, &amp; une autre moitié qui est dans la nuit. Remarquez d'ailleurs que comme une Balle a moins de force &amp; de vitesse après qu'elle a été donner contre une muraille qui l'a renvoyée d'un autre côté, de même la lumière s'affoiblit lors qu'elle a été réfléchie par quelque Corps. Cette lumière blanchâtre qui nous vient de la Lune, est la lumière même du Soleil, mais elle ne peut venir de la Lune à nous que par une réflexion. Elle a donc beaucoup perdu de la force &amp; de la vivacité qu'elle avoit lorsqu'elle étoit receüe directement sur la Lune, &amp; cette lumière éclatante que nous recevons du Soleil &amp; que la Terre reflechit sur la Lune, ne doit plus être qu'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée. Ainsi ce qui nous paroit lumineux dans la Lune, &amp; qui nous éclaire pendant nos nuits, ce sont des parties de la Lune qui ont le jour; &amp; les parties de la Terre qui ont le jour lors qu'elles sont tournées vers les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit les éclairent aussi. Tout dépend de la manière dont la Lune &amp; la Terre se regardent. Dans les premiers jours du mois que l'on ne voit pas la Lune, c'est qu'elle est entre le Soleil &amp; nous, &amp; qu'elle marche de jour avec le Soleil. Il faut necessairement que toute sa moitié qui a le jour, soit tournée vers le Soleil, &amp; que toute sa moitié qui a la nuit, soit tournée vers nous. Nous n'avons garde de voir cette moitié qui n'a aucune lumière pour se faire voir. Mais cette moitié de la Lune qui a la nuit, étant tournée vers la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, nous voit sans être veüe, &amp; nous voit sous la même figure que nous voyons la Pleine Lune.

You are always for the Moon, said I, and you cannot rid your self of those Remains of Kindness you have for her.

'Tis just, said the Marquiese, as when we are struck and surpriz'd with the Splendour of Quality above our own; we do not perceive, that in the main, there's no difference between them and us. 'Tis just so, said I; and we will needs be judging of every thing; but we have the mis-fortune, still to be plac'd in a false Light: Wou'd we judge of our selves, we are too near; if of others, we are too far off: Cou'd one be plac'd between the Moon and the Earth, that wou'd be a true Station to consider both well: To this End, we ought only to be Spectators of the World, and not Inhabitants. I shall never be satisfy'd, said the Marquiese, with the Injury we do the Earth, in being too favourably engag'd for the Inhabitants of the Moon, unless you can assure me, that they are as ignorant of their Advantages, as we are of ours; and that they take our Earth for a Star, without knowing that the Globe they inhabit is one also. Be assur'd of that, Madam, said I, that the Earth appears to them to perform all the Functions of a Star: 'Tis true, they do not see the Earth describe a Circle round 'em, but that's all one; I'll explain to you what it is: That side of the Moon which was turn'd towards the Earth at the beginning of the World, has continu'd towards the Earth ever since; which still represents to us these same Eyes, Nose and Mouth, which our Imaginations fansie we see compos'd of these Spots, Lights and Shadows, which are the Surface of the Moon: Cou'd we see the other half of the Moon, 'tis possible our Fancy wou'd represent to us some other Figure.

Be pleas'd, besides, to consider that a Ball has less force and swiftness after it re- bounds from a Wall, against which it was thrown, than it had before it touch'd the Wall, which sends it another way; so Light is not so strong, after 'tis reflected by any solid Body: This pale Light which comes to us from the Moon, is the Light of the Sun it self, but we have it only by Reflection from the Moon, and has lost a great deal of that Strength and Vivacity which it had when 'twas receiv'd by the Moon, directly from the Sun; and that bright and dazling Light which we receive from the Sun, must in the same manner appear to the Inhabitants of the Moon, after 'tis reflected by the Earth, on the Moon: So that the Surface of the Moon, which we see enlightned, and which shines upon us in the Night, is that half of the Moon that enjoys the Day, as that half of the Globe of the Earth which is enlightned by the Sun, when 'tis turn'd towards the darkened half of the Globe of the Moon, does give Light to the Inhabitants there, during their Nights. All depends upon the different Opposition and Aspects between the Moon and the Earth: The first and second Day of the Moon, we do not see her, because she is betwixt the Sun and us, and moves with the Sun by our Day; it necessarily follows, that the half of the Moon which is enlightned, is turn'd towards the Sun, and the obscure part towards the Earth; 'tis no wonder then, that we cannot see that half which is dark; but that same half of the Moon which is in Darkness, being turn'd towards the enlightned half of the Earth, the Inhabitants see us, without being seen, and the Earth appears to them, as their Full-Moon does to us; and so, if one may use the Expression, 'tis with them Full-Earth. After this, the Moon going on in her Monthly Circle, dis-engages her self from the Sun, and begins to turn towards us a part of her enlightned half, which is the Crescent; at the very same time, the darkned half of the Moon loses some share of the enlightned part of the Earth, and then the Earth is in the Wain, as to its Inhabitants.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P019: But, said the Marquiese, is the Earth as proper for reflecting the Light of the Sun, as the Moon?

'Solid' makes explicit what is only implied, emphasizing the physical similarity for clarity, especially considering the historical context of debate about the composition of celestial bodies.","The English translation introduces 'To this End,' which explicitly frames the statement as a logical consequence or purpose, whereas the French only states the necessary condition without stating the intended purpose. This foregrounds a philosophical perspective on human perception and judgment, which was an Enlightenment theme.","The translator makes explicit that 'they are as ignorant of their Advantages, as we are of ours', separating the specific ignorance of advantages from the subsequent statement about mistaking Earth's astronomical status. The French leaves more implicit the reasoning behind the request for assurance and the equivalence of ignorance.","The French says only that the same face is always turned to us, mentioning 'these eyes, this mouth, and the rest of this face that our imagination composes for her based on the spots she shows us.' The English makes explicit that the 'eyes, nose and mouth' are 'compos'd of these Spots, Lights and Shadows, which are the Surface of the Moon,' spelling out that the imagination is drawing directly from these lunar features, which were commonly discussed among the learned in early modern astronomy.","The French mentions only that the Moon 'turns on itself as much as it does around the Earth, that is, in a month; but when it makes a part of this trembling, and imagining that in the sky we have a pendulum movement which goes and comes.' The English supplies, 'and no doubt but the Inhabitants of the Moon attribute this shaking to the Earth, and believe we make a certain swinging in the Heavens, like the Pendulum of a Clock.' This spells out what was only alluded to regarding the perspective of lunar inhabitants and their interpretation, clarifying the analogy for readers.","The French explains, 'the Moon...moves out from under the Sun, and begins to turn towards us a small part of its illuminated half, and there is the Crescent. Then also the parts of the Moon that have night begin to see less of the half of Earth that has day, and we are in Decours (waning) for them.' The English spells out more explicitly, 'the Crescent; at the very same time, the darkned half of the Moon loses some share of the enlightned part of the Earth, and then the Earth is in the Wain, as to its Inhabitants,' making explicit the reciprocal relationship and explicitly naming the lunar phase from the perspective of lunar inhabitants."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je saurai tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Je vois en gennral que dans la Lune ils ont un mois à rebours du nôtre</span></span>, &amp; je gage que quand nous avons pleine Lune, c'est que toute la moitié lumineuse de la Lune est tournée vers toute la moitié obscure de la Terre; qu'alors ils ne nous voyent point du tout, &amp; qu'ils comtent Nouvelle Terre.

When 'tis New Moon, and that she is between the Sun and the Earth, and that all her obscure half is turn'd towards us, who then enjoy the Day, you may see easily, that the Shadow of this darkned half is cast upon the Earth; if the Moon be directly under the Sun, this Shadow hides the Sun from us, and at the same time darkens a part of the enlightened half of the Earth, which was seen by the Inhabitants of the obscure half of the Moon: And this is an Eclipse of the Sun to us, in our Day; and an Eclipse of the Earth to those in the Moon, in their Night. When the Moon is at the Full, the Earth is betwixt her and the Sun, and all the obscure part of the Earth is turn'd towards the enlightned half of the Moon, the Shadow of the Earth is then cast upon the Moon; and if it falls directly on her Surface, it obscures the enlightned half which we see, and hides the Sun from that enlightned part of the Moon that enjoy'd the Day: This is an Eclipse of the Moon to us, during our Night; and an Eclipse of the Sun to them, during their Day. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">By this Reason, it falls out, that there are not always Eclipses when the Moon interposes between the Sun and the Earth, or the Earth is interjected between the Sun and the Moon; because these three Bodies are not opposite one to another, in a streight Line; and by consequence, that of the three, which ought to make the Eclipse, casts its shadow a little to one side of that which shou'd be eclips'd.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French source states, 'je vois en général que dans la Lune ils ont un mois à rebours du nôtre' ('I see in general that in the Moon they have a month reverse to ours'), whose subject is 'they', implicitly referring to Moon's inhabitants. The translation makes this implicit information explicit by specifying 'the Inhabitants of the Moon have their Month, the exact Reverse of ours,' clarifying that it is the people (or imagined inhabitants) on the Moon who experience this reversed month, making the implicit inhabitants explicit.","The French source explains why eclipses do not always occur, citing a lack of exact alignment of the three bodies in a straight line, the result being that the shadow is cast a bit to the side. The English translation explicates this by stating, 'because these three Bodies are not opposite one to another, in a streight Line,' and 'that of the three, which ought to make the Eclipse, casts its shadow a little to one side of that which shou'd be eclips'd.' The phrases 'interposes between the Sun and the Earth, or the Earth is interjected between the Sun and the Moon' and 'because these three Bodies are not opposite one to another, in a streight Line' spell out the relationships and sequence of events more overtly compared to the source, offering clarifying connective explanations that are only implicit in the French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P028: Je suis fort étonnée, dit la Marquise, qu'il y ait si peu de mystere aux Eclipses, &amp; que tout le monde n'en devine pas la cause.

The translation makes explicit the religious or ritualistic nature of the action by rephrasing it as 'thinking that most devout posture for obtaining from the Sun and Moon, a defence against that Demon,' which spells out their belief in the efficacy of that action as a devout act.","The source says 'des Magiciennes la faisoient descendre du Ciel pour jeter sur les Herbes une certaine écume malfaisante' ('sorceresses made her descend from the sky to cast some harmful foam on the grasses'). The translation adds 'poisonous Scum or Dew upon the Herbs and Grass', making explicit that the foam is both a 'scum' and potentially 'dew', and clarifies its harmfulness as 'poisonous', thus specifying what is only implied in the original.","The French 'une infinité de Gens ne se tinrent-ils pas enfermez dans des caves' ('an infinity of people shut themselves up in caves') is translated as 'Did not a great many People shut themselves up in Vaults and Cellars?' The translation makes explicit the kinds of places (vaults and cellars), whereas the French only said 'caves.' This provides more concrete imagery for the modern reader.","The source's 'n'écrivirent ils pas en vain?' ('did they not write in vain?') becomes 'did not the learned Men write in vain, to assure us, there was no danger?' Here, the translation makes explicit that the learned men were writing to 'assure us, there was no danger,' whereas the French only implies the intent of their writings.","The French 'je croirois même, ajoûtai-je en riant, que comme un nombre prodigieux d'hommes ont été assez fous, & le sont encore assez pour adorer la Lune, il y a des Gens dans la Lune qui adorent aussi la Terre, & que nous sommes à genoux les uns devant les autres' ('that just as a prodigious number of men have been and still are foolish enough to worship the Moon, there are people on the Moon who also worship the Earth, and that we are on our knees before each other') is translated as 'I am apt to believe, that as there has been, and still are, many Inhabitants in our Globe, who are such Fools to adore the Moon; there are also Inhabitants in the Moon, foolish enough to adore our Earth.' The translator makes explicit the sense of mutual foolishness and reciprocal worship by adding 'also...foolish enough' and clarifies 'men' as 'Inhabitants,' which universalizes the idea.","The French 'mais comme il ne faut qu'un peu d'esprit & d'habileté dans les Gens de ce Pays-là, pour détruire tous ces honneurs dont nous nous flattons, j'avoüe que je crains toûjours que nous n'ayons quelque desavantage.' ('but as only a bit of wit and cleverness in the people of that country is needed to destroy all these honors in which we pride ourselves, I admit I always fear that we are at some disadvantage') is translated as 'But since there is only requisite, a little more Wit and Ingenuity in the Inhabitants of that Country, to blast the Honour we flatter our selves with, I confess, I am still apprehensive, they may have some Advantage over us.' The translation makes explicit the process of 'blasting honour,' the 'country' as the Moon, and the possible resulting 'advantage' as potentially more permanent, sharpening the competitive aspect.","The French 'L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à être generalement répanduë' ('Ignorance is something quite apt to be generally widespread') is rendered 'Ignorance is naturally a very general Talent;' explicitly reformulating ignorance as a 'talent' that people possess and generalizing its spread as 'natural', which increases explicitness about the condition.","The source 'je ne fais que deviner celle des Gens de la Lune, je n'en doute non plus que des Nouvelles les plus seures qui nous viennent de là.' ('I am only guessing at that of the people of the Moon, but I do not doubt it any more than the most certain news we receive from there') becomes 'and though I do but guess at that of the Inhabitants of the Moon, yet I no more doubt of it, than I do of the most certain News we have from thence.' The translation makes explicit that 'the most certain news' refers to the information 'we have from thence [the Moon],' clarifying the referent that was only casually implied in the French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P032: Et quelles sont ces Nouvelles seures? interrompit-elle.

Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines</span></span>, &amp; pour moy <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques</span></span>, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole</span></span> dans la Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà.</span></span> Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne cro<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"20\">y pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres.</span></span></span></span> Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"21\">je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-containe</span></span>r\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"22\">En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne.</span></span> Mais pour achever de m'ôter le mien, dites-moy, &amp; dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune; car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une manière assez positive. Moi, repris- je. Je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune. Voyez combien la face de la Nature est changée d'icy à la Chine; d'autres Visages, d'autres Figures, d'autres Moeurs, &amp; presque d'autres Principes de raisonnement. D'icy à la Lune le changement doit être bien plus considerable. Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine; qui pourrait pousser jusqu'à la Lune, assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit. </p><p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience? De bonne foy, Madame, repliquay-je, je n'en say rien. S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, &amp; que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; &amp; si d'ailleurs nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eût ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures qu'on appelle le Genre humain? Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eût des passions si folles, &amp; des reflexions si sages; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">une durée si courte, &amp; des veües si longues, tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, &amp; tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, &amp; tant d'inclination à la Servitude; une si forte envie d'être heureux, &amp; une si grande incapacité de l'être</span></span>? Il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela. Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mêmes, &amp; nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits. On a eté réduit à dire que les Dieux etoient plein de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes, &amp; que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sang froid, ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire. Nous voila donc bien en seureté du côté des Gens de la Lune, dit la Marquise, ils ne nous devineront pas; mais je voudrais que nous les pussions deviner, car en verité cela inquiete, de savoir qu'ils sont là-haut, dans cette Lune que nous voyons, &amp; de ne pouvoir pas se figurer comment ils sont faits. Et pourquoi, rêpondis-je, n'avez-vous point d'inquietude sur les Habitans de cette grande Terre Australe qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe? Nous sommes portés eux &amp; nous sur un même Vaisseau dont ils occupent la Proüe, &amp; nous la Pouppe. Vous voyez que de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, &amp; qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font, &amp; vous voudriez savoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux? </p><p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. Ah! vous me soulagez, répliqua la Marquise, votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of.</p> <p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse.</p> <p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</p> <p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</p> <p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">under and near the South-Pole</span></span>, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn.</span></span> What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions.</span></span> See what he treats of. </p><p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests.</span></span> But that which he beheld yet more rare, was <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes</span></span> and the sighs of Lovers.</span></span> As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.)</span></span> Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs.</span></span> I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full</span></span>; and for my part, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self.</span></span> The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after</span></span>: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full.

For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">I do not think we should find Men and Women there.</span></span> What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition;</span></span> for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","explanations":["The original French mentions 'un Cardinal' and 'un grand Pape', but the translation spells out both as 'a great Church-man', making the allusion accessible for readers unfamiliar with Catholic officeholders. 'Church-man' also broadens the referent for an English Protestant readership wary of papal authority, reflecting cultural adaptation and explicitation.","The English translation expands the poetical license ('licence Poëtique') to include 'Liberty of Conscience', a term resonant with the English religious and political debates of the late 17th century, and not present in the French, making an implicit cultural resonance explicit for contemporary English readers.","By describing the nymphs as 'beautiful', the translation makes explicit a characteristic (their beauty) implied but not stated in the succinct French original, emphasizing aesthetic value for the English reader.","The English expands the French list with explicit details: 'time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men', 'or thrown away at Play', 'The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes', etc., unpacking and clarifying what is only broadly indicated in the original, giving greater clarity and specificity.","The English spells out the implied meaning—'le temps qu'on donne au Jeu'—by clarifying: 'time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play', adding the notion of time lost in political hope not expressed in the French.","The translation clarifies 'les Aumônes qu'on fait faire après sa mort' (the alms one has given after one's death), as 'the Alms that one causes to be given after one's Death', making explicit the fact that it is not the person, but their heirs or executors who arrange the alms, suitable for an English audience unfamiliar with French Catholic funeral customs.","The original only mentions 'les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes' (verses presented), but the English renders this as 'The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes', adding 'Dedications' which were frequent in English patronage culture, explicitly expanding the referent.","The source says simply 'Messieurs de l'Observatoire', referring implicitly to astronomers, while the target says 'the nicest Observators', making explicit for English readers the role of these learned men as observers (astronomers).","The French quickly lists surprising lunar phenomena ('d'autres fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts, & ...des Nymphes'), whereas the English translation expands this list: 'Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and ... beautiful Nymphs...)', explicitly listing features that in French were omitted, and highlighting the 'beauty' of the nymphs.","The English repeats and expands the whole rare valley segment, specifying details previously condensed, as above, with explicit items: 'Grandure', 'time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men', etc.—making more concrete connections for the reader.","The English specifies that Astolpho 'was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full', clarifying 'beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages' (many people he had believed wise) by explicitly stating Astolpho's belief and wonder, foregrounding his perspective.","The English slightly clarifies and condenses 'je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques' to 'Visions, both Philophick and poetical', specifying the types of visions in English terms, making the original list more accessible.","The English expands 'je ne saurois croire que de la folie' (I cannot believe that foolishness) to 'I do not think we should find Men and Women there', making explicit the reason—lunar beings would not be men or women (humans)—rather than simply denying the presence of (human) folly.","The translation turns 'on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut' (one cannot catch it again when one wishes) into 'and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases', making the pronoun and antecedent (the wits/spirits) explicit.","The French has 'sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient' (upon each vial is written the name of the one to whom the spirit belongs), while the English expands to 'and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs', making explicit the possessive quality in the plural and the referent of 'those'.","The English makes explicit the consequence implied in French: 'That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self', unpacking the double entendre of receiving a vial (losing one's wits) through philosophical conversation.","Where the French says Astolphe 'reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie', the English translation elaborates the recovery ('snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water') and further explains, 'Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after', making explicit what in French is left implicit ('il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà').","In the English, the implicit juxtapositions in 'une durée si courte, & des veües si longues, tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, & tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, & tant d'inclination à la Servitude; une si forte envie d'être heureux, & une si grande incapacité de l'être' are reorganized and expounded: 'so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it;', making contrasts and the ironies explicit.","The French refers elliptically to 'la Donation de Constantin' as something whose fate cannot be accounted for ('on ne sauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë'). The English says, with explicit asides, 'even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.)', making the secrecy and controversy of the Donation more manifest, likely for a Protestant audience for whom the Donation had polemical resonance.","The English translation takes the French poetic apostrophe, expands, and interprets: rendering the rhetorical question as 'That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose', and then making the implication of loss and retrieval explicit in prose.","The English summarizes and spells out the two scenarios of wits lost for love and by philosophy, and explicitly details that 'their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases.' This makes explicit the metaphor and its application to the previous discussion.","The English shifts from 'nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne' to explain 'our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.' Here, the notion of 'Quartier des Phioles philosophiques' is made explicit as a metaphorical 'Rank' or class, and the wandering/erring spirits are immediately justified and valorized."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.

Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voilà le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste.</span></span> Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune; conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable.</span></span> Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.

We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, as the Earth is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change; there lies the difficulty: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are at from the Moon. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination and a Kindness for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling. It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon (for certainly it emits Vapours;) and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain: And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence; so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, with a little Knowledge; but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but I told her, 'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them.

Why not, said she, laughing? I wou'd go of my self into their Nets, to have the satisfaction of seeing those that had caught me. Consider, said I, that you wou'd be very weak and feeble, before you come to the Surface of our Air; for we cannot breath it in all its Extent, and we can hardly live on the Tops of high Mountains; and I wonder that those who are so foolish as to believe, that Corporeal Geniuses inhabit the purest Air, do not tell us why these Geniuses visit us so seldom, and stay so short a while: I do believe, 'tis because few amongst 'em know how to dive; and that even those who are skilful in that Art, have great difficulty to penetrate the grossness of the Air which we breath. You see therefore, that Nature has set many Bars and Fences, to hinder us from going out of our World, into that of the Moon. However, for our Satisfaction, let us conjecture and guess as much as we can of that world: For Example; I fansie that the Inhabitants of the Moon must see the Heavens, the Sun, and the Stars, of a different Colour than what they appear to us. All these Objects we see through a kind of natural Perspective-Glass, which changes them to us; this Perspective-glass of ours is mix'd with Vapours and Exhalations, which do not ascend very high. Some of late pretend, that the Air of it self is blew, as well as the Water of the Sea; and that that Colour is not apparent in the one, nor the other, but at a great depth: The Heavens, say they, in which are plac'd the fixed Stars, has of it self no Light; and by consequence, ought to appear black: But we see it through our Air, which is blew; and therefore the Heavens appear of that Colour.

The translation makes her motive more explicit ('to have the satisfaction of seeing those that had caught me'), highlighting her agency and the reason for her action.","The French states it is 'not breathable for us in its whole extent... we can hardly breathe atop some mountains.' The English makes this explicit by stating, 'we cannot breath it in all its Extent, and we can hardly live on the Tops of high Mountains;' thus spelling out the connection between altitude and habitability rather than just respirability.","The English translation unpacks the original's condensed explanation and non-stated reasoning. The French says some 'do not also say that... it's because few know how to dive... and those can only make short dives...' The English version explicitly speculates, 'do not tell us why these Geniuses visit us so seldom, and stay so short a while: I do believe, 'tis because few amongst 'em know how to dive; and that even those who are skilful in that Art, have great difficulty to penetrate the grossness of the Air which we breath.' The translator brings the reasoning to the foreground, spelling out what is only briefly suggested in the French.","Where the French refers to 'barrieres naturelles,' the translation specifies 'Nature has set many Bars and Fences, to hinder us from going out of our World, into that of the Moon.' The English makes explicit that these barriers are natural constraints established by Nature that specifically act as obstacles both ways, while the French is more general.","The English renders 'notre Air, mêlé comme il est de vapeurs & d'exhalaisons, & qui ne s'étend pas bien haut' as 'this Perspective-glass of ours is mix'd with Vapours and Exhalations, which do not ascend very high,' making it explicit that the 'Perspective-glass' is actually the 'air' being described metaphorically, clarifying the connection between literal air and metaphor.","The translation expands 'notre Air n'est non plus qu'un gros broüillard, qui nous doit alterer la vraye couleur & du Ciel & du Soleil & des Etoiles' into 'so all our Air, which is nothing else but a thick Fog, must certainly alter the true natural Colour of the Heavens, Sun and Stars to us;' making explicit that the alteration affects our perception specifically, not just a physical alteration.","The French phrase simply says 'only the celestial substance could bring us the light and colors in their purity,' whereas the translation makes it clear ('for nothing but the pure heavenly Substance is capable to convey to us Light and Colours, in their Purity and Perfection, as they are') that no other substance can play this role, and it also adds 'Perfection,' which raises the level of explicit contrast.","The French ends with 'Enfin, à l'égard des Gens de la Lune, cette Lunette au travers de laquelle on voit tout, est changée.' The translation unpacks this as 'In short, if there be Inhabitants in the Moon, they see all things chang'd, through their Perspective-glasses, which is their Air.' The translator clarifies for the English reader that 'Perspective-glasses' refers to the Moon dwellers' air, and that it is 'if there be Inhabitants' rather than implicitly alluding to them."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy.

They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another.

No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other? Seriously, said I, Madam, 'twould be a great Pleasure and Satisfaction to see several different Worlds; and I am often glad, to make these Journeys in Imagination; what joy then it wou'd be to do it in reality; that wou'd be far better than to travel from hence to Iapan, crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again.

The English explicates this by clearly stating 'And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates.' The translator spells out that the sensation of taste is specifically suggested to 'proceed from' these animals biting and stinging the tongue and palate, making explicit the implied causality.","The French—'Mêlez de certaines choses dans quelques-unes de ces Liqueurs, ou exposez-les au Soleil, ou laissez-les se corrompre, voilà aussi-tôt de nouvelles especes de petits Animaux'—is expanded in English to 'If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,) and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures,' adding the concrete example 'as Pepper in Water,' which spells out an implied type of experiment, and translates the conditional statement into direct instructions.","The French says that 'de l'un côté de la feüille à l'autre, n'ont pas plus de communication avec les autres Vermisseaux qui y vivent, que nous avec nos Antipodes.' The English glosses this as 'there is no more Communication between the living Creatures on the one side, and those on the other, than between us and the Antipodes,' making explicit that the 'communication' refers to the living creatures on each side of the leaf, and also adds detail by specifying 'on the one side, and those on the other', where the French is more condensed.","The French, 'je la ferois plutôt ronger par ses Habitans que de n'y en pas mettre,' is rendered as 'I wou'd rather make it be devour'd and consum'd by its Inhabitants, than to place none at all in it.'

Further off, the old know no more than the young. Here we trouble our selves more to know what's to come, than to know what's past.

The English translation makes explicit the logical conclusion: 'and therefore they must all be different', spelling out what was previously only implied.","The French says that you would have to find the 'model' of faces for each 'family'. The English explicates this by saying there is a 'certain resemblance and Air of the Countenance peculiar to every Family or Race of Men', explicitly adding the idea of 'Race of Men' to clarify the scope of 'family'.","The French says inhabitants of Earth are a 'petite Famille' whose faces resemble each other; on another planet, it's another family with different faces. The English makes the implicit parallel explicit: 'We, the Inhabitants of the Earth, are but one little Family of the Universe, we resemble one another. The Inhabitants of another Planet, are another Family, whose Faces have another Air peculiar to themselves;' clarifying both universality and peculiarity.","The French only says that an observer would notice that an Earth and Moon inhabitant are from two closer worlds than Earth and Saturn, meaning differences must increase with distance. The English makes this progression explicit: 'by all appearance, the difference increases with the distance, for cou'd one see...'—directly stating the implied pattern.","The French speculates about a sixth sense that may be missing from us but present in another world, or that there might be many natural senses, but we only have five because we are content from lack of knowledge. The English explicates how this difference operates, restating the idea from different perspectives and adding, 'because we know no better,' making explicit the reason for our contentment.","The French states that this planet enjoys love but is desolated by war in several parts. The English makes the contrast more direct: 'Our Globe enjoys the Pleasure of Love; but is destroyed in several places by the fury of War', explicitly stating the world is 'destroyed', not only 'desolate'.","The French says Nature, in distributing happiness or talents among men on a small scale, has likely done so among worlds on a large scale, having remembered to use her secret for variety and equality through compensation. The English makes explicit that 'Nature has done to the several Worlds in great, as she has done to us Mortals in little by making some happy, others miserable. Yet she has never forgot her admirable Art in varying all things, tho she has made some equal in some respects, by compensating the want of any one thing, with another of equal value.'

Also, it unpacks 'on jugea aussi-tôt que ces taches en êtoient; qu'elles avoient un mouvement autour du Soleil, & qu'elles nous en cachoient necessaairement quelque partie, en tournant leur moitié obscure vers nous.' into a much more explicit explanation: 'they believ'd the Spots in the Sun were nothing else but these new Planets, moving round 'em, which necessarily hid a part of his Body from our sight, when their obscure Side was turn'd towards us.' The translator spells out the mechanism by which the sunspots would hide part of the Sun, which is only briefly suggested in the French.","The French says 'Les Savans faisoient leur Cour de ces pretendües Planetes à tous les Princes de l'Europe.'

The translation makes more explicit the acts of naming (assigning planet names), the social status of those involved ('most Kings and Princes'), and the potential for conflict, which is only implicitly suggested with 'peut-être il y auroit eu querelle entre-eux à qui seroit demeuré le maître des taches pour les nommer comme il eût voulu...'"]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

Serieusement il me paroîtroit plus regulier &amp; plus uniforme que toutes les Planetes, grandes &amp; petites, n'eussent que le même mouvement autour du Soleil! </p><p>P064: Ah! Madame, répliquai-je, Si vous saviez ce que c'est que les Tourbillons de Descartes, ces Tourbillons dont le nom est si terrible, &amp; l'idée si agreable, vous ne parleriez pas comme vous faites. La tête me dût-elle tourner, dit elle en riant, il est beau de savoir ce que c'est que les Tourbillons. Achevez de me rendre folle, je ne me ménage plus, je ne connois plus de retenuë sur la Philosophie; laissons parler le monde, &amp; donnons-nous aux Tourbillons. Je ne vous connaissois pas de pareils emportements, répris-je; c'est dommage qu'ils n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet. Ce qu'on appelle un Tourbillon, c'est un amas de matiere dont les parties sont détachées les unes des autres, &amp; se meuvent toutes en un même sens; permis à elles d'avoir pendant ce temps-là quelques petites mouvements particuliers, pourveu qu'elles suivent toûjours le mouvement general. Ainsi un Tourbillon de vent, c'est une infinité de petites parties d'air, qui tournent en rond toutes ensemble, &amp; enveloppent ce qu'elles rencontrent. Vous savez que les Planetes sont portées dans la matiere celeste, qui est d'une subtilité, &amp; d'une agitation prodigieuse. Tout ce grand amas de matiere celeste, qui est depuis le Soleil jusqu'aux Etoiles fixes, tourne en rond, &amp; emportant avec soy les Planetes, les fait tourner toutes en un même sens autour du Soleil, qui occupe le centre; mais en des temps plus ou moins longs, selon qu'elles en sont plus ou moins éloignées. Il n'y a pas jusqu'au Soleil qui ne tourne; mais il ne tourne que sur luy-même, parce qu'il est justement au milieu de toute cette matiere celeste; &amp; vous remarquerez en passant, que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">quand la Terre seroit dans la place où il est, elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle- même.</span></span> </p><p>P065: Voilà quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme le Maître; mais en même temps les Planetes se composent de petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de celuy du Soleil. Chacune d'elles en tournant autour du Soleil, ne laisse pas de tourner autour d'elle-même, &amp; fait tourner aussi autour d'elle en même sens une certaine quantité de cette matière céleste, qui est toûjours prête à suivre tous les mouvements qu'on luy veut donner, s'ils ne la détournent pas de son mouvement general. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">C'est là le Tourbillon particulier de la Planete &amp; elle le pousse aussi loin que la force de son mouvement se peut étendre. S'il faut qu'il tombe dans ce petit Tourbillon quelque Planete moindre que celle qui y domine, la voilà emportée par la grande &amp; forcée indispensablement à tourner autour d'elle, &amp; le tout ensemble, la grande Planete, la petite, &amp; le Tourbillon qui les renferme, n'en tourne pas moins autour du Soleil. C'est ainsi qu'au commencement du Monde nous nous fîmes suivre par la Lune, parce qu'elle se trouva dans l'étenduë de notre Tourbillon, &amp; tout à fait à notre bienséance. Jupiter, dont je commençois à vous parler, fut plus heureux ou plus puissant que nous. Il y avoit dans son voisinage quatre petites Planètes, ils se les assujettit toutes quatre, &amp; nous qui sommes une Planète principale, croyez-vous que nous l'eussions êté, si nous nous fussions trouvés proches de luy? Il est quatre vingt- dix-fois plus gros que nous, il nous auroit engloutis sans peine dans son Tourbillon, &amp; nous ne serions qu'une Lune de sa dépendance, au lieu que nous en avons une qui est dans la nôtre, tant il est vray que le seul hazard de la situation décide souvent de toute la fortune qu'on doit avoir.</span></span> </p><p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes? Je commence à craindre que nous ne fassions la folie de nous approcher d'une Planete aussi entreprenante que Jupiter, ou qu'il ne vienne vers nous pour nous absorber; car il me paroît que dans ce grand mouvement, où vous dites qu'est la matière Celeste, elle devroit agiter les Planetes irregulièrement, tantôt les approcher, tantôt les éloigner les unes des autres. Nous pourrions aussi-tôt y gagner qu'y perdre, répondis-je, peut être irions- nous soumettre à notre domination Mercure &amp; Venus, qui sont de petites Planetes, &amp; qui ne nous pourroient résister. Mais nous n'avons rien à esperer ny à craindre; les Planetes se tiennent où elles sont, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">les nouvelles conquêtes leur sont défenduës, comme elles l'étoient autrefois aux Rois de la Chine.</span></span> Vous savez bien que quand on met de l'huile avec de l'eau, l'huile surnage. Qu'on mette sur ces deux liqueurs un Corps extremement léger, l'huile le soûtiendra, &amp; il n'ira pas jusqu'à l'eau. Qu'on y mette un autre Corps plus pesant, &amp; qui soit justement d'une certaine pesanteur, il passera au travers de l'huile, qui sera trop foible pour l'arrêter, &amp; tombera jusqu'à ce qu'il rencontre l'eau, qui aura la force de le soûtenir. Ainsi dans cette liqueur composée de deux liqueurs qui ne se mêlent point, deux Corps inégalement pesants se mettent naturellement à deux places differentes, &amp; jamais l'un ne montera, ny l'autre ne descendra. Qu'on mette encore d'autres liqueurs qui se tiennent separées, &amp; qu'on y plonge d'autres corps, il arrivera la même chose. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Représentez-vous que la Matiere Celeste qui remplit ce grand Tourbillon, à differentes couches qui s'enveloppent les unes les autres, &amp; dont les pesanteurs sont différentes, comme celles de l'huile &amp; de l'eau, &amp; des autres liqueurs. Les Planetes ont aussi differentes pesanteurs; chacune d'elles par consequent s'arrête dans la couche qui a précisément la force necessaire pour la soûtenir, &amp; qui luy fait équilibre, &amp; vous voyez bien qu'il n'est pas possible qu'elle en sorte jamais.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light.

In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">Guards</span></span>: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light.

The English makes explicit that the inhabitants would be 'blind men,' not just any 'blind,' and further specifies 'Country' to equate 'séjour' not just with a dwelling but a populated political entity, clarifying the implicit notion of habitation.","The source provides a short list and says 'toutes Planetes que nous avons visitées' (all planets we have visited). The English renders 'Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited', spelling out 'all which Planets' for emphasis and explication, thus making explicit that all the previously listed bodies are the ones visited.","The French 'Ce sont quatre petites Planetes qui tournent autour de luy, comme notre Lune tourne autour de nous' is rendered as 'they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us.' The English spelling out the pronoun 'they' and reiterating 'Planets' instead of just 'Ce sont' makes explicit and emphasizes the subject, supporting a didactic and explanatory tone for readers potentially less familiar with astronomical references.","The French says 'quand la Terre seroit dans la place où il est, elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle- même' (if the Earth were in the place where it is [the Sun]' she could not help but turn on itself). The English renders this as 'if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that,' which spells out 'in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is,' making explicit what is only implicit in the French regarding the position of the Sun and the reason for Earth's rotation.","The French segment ('C'est là le Tourbillon particulier...') describes the mechanics of planetary whirlings, with implicit connections between the Moon's capture and the cause and effect of planetary sizes and influence. The English expands and explicates the science: 'after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience.' It spells out what is meant by the Moon being 'in the extent of our whirling,' specifying it as a 'Sphere of Activity,' and adding 'and forc'd its Obedience,' which makes explicit the physical forcing of orbital behavior. It also details 'Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth,' which is informative rather than implicit ('il est quatre vingt- dix-fois plus gros que nous' comes much later).","The French 'les nouvelles conquêtes leur sont défenduës, comme elles l'étoient autrefois aux Rois de la Chine' is rendered as 'new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China.' The English explicates the historical nuance with the phrase 'as they were heretofore,' reinforcing the time relationship and making explicit the analogy that these prohibitions are in the past ('autrefois') for Chinese kings, which could be missed by a non-historically alert reader.","The French explains that celestial matter is made up of layers with different weights. The English expands this with 'Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors.' The simile 'like an Onion' is an explicitation (not in the French original), clarifying the nested structure of these layers for English readers. The phrase 'and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence' is more explicit than the French 'vous voyez bien qu'il n'est pas possible qu'elle en sorte jamais,' explicating both the naturalness and impossibility for planets to leave their assigned positions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P067: Je conçois, dit la Marquise, que ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs.

Vous le devineriez peut-être, si vous en aviez bien envie, répondis-je. Les Etoiles Fixes ne sauroient être moins éloignées de la Terre que de quelques cinquante millions de lieuë, &amp; si vous fâchiez un Astronome, il les mettroit encore plus loin. La distance du Soleil à la Planete la plus éloignée, n'est par rapport à la distance du Soleil ou de la Terre aux Etoiles Fixes, &amp; on ne prend pas la peine de la compter. Leur lumière, comme vous voyez, est assez vive &amp; assez éclatante. Si elles la recevoient du Soleil, il faudroit qu'elles la receussent déja bien foible aprés un trajet de cinquante millions de lieuë; il faudroit que par une reflexion qui l'affoibliroit encore beaucoup, elles nous la renvoyassent à cette même distance. Il seroit impossible qu'une lumière, qui auroit essuyé une reflexion, &amp; fait deux fois cinquante millions de lieuë, eût cette force et cette vivacité qu'a celle des Etoiles Fixes.

Notre Soleil a des Planetes qu'il éclaire, pourquoy chaque Etoile Fixe n'en aura-t-elle pas aussi qu'elle éclairera?

(Even ourselves, to whom the same expression applies, admit that you can hardly distinguish us amid so many worlds.) In the translation, it is rendered 'and what shall become of us in the middle of so many Worlds; since the Title you give to the rest agrees to this of ours?' The translator explicitates that the indistinguishability is a consequence of sharing the same 'title' or designation as inhabitants of the planets, making the implied connection more precise for the reader.","The source states, 'si on fait desseins sur desseins, si on se donne tant de peine, c'est que l'on ne connoît pas les Tourbillons..' (if one makes plans upon plans, if one takes so much trouble, it is because one does not know the Tourbillons..), while the translation expands it to 'laying design upon design, circumventing, betraying, flattering, and poorly lying, and are at all this mighty Pains to grasp a part of a World they neither know nor understand, nor any thing of these mighty Tourbillions...' This amplifies the behaviors (circumventing, betraying, flattering, lying) that are only implied in the French by providing explicit actions, thus spelling out social and political ambitions.","The French says, 'Les autres Mondes vous rendent celuy-cy petit, mais ils ne vous gâtent point de beaux yeux, ou une belle bouche, cela vaut toûjours son prix en dépit de tous les Mondes possibles.' (Other worlds make this one seem small, but they do not spoil beautiful eyes, or a beautiful mouth, that is always of value in spite of all the possible worlds.) The English makes explicit the rhetorical point by adding, 'or make the Charms of Wit ever the less: These will still have their true Value, still bear a price in spight of all the Worlds in the Universe.' The addition of 'the Charms of Wit' and the explicit emphasis on 'true Value' and 'bear a price' unpacks the implication about what remains valuable, making it more explicit for the target audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle, en riant; il se sauve de tout, &amp; il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal.

These two sorts of Men, The Lover and Philosopher always take more than is given 'em. You must acknowledge that when I see two Objects alike in every thing that I do see, I have Reason to believe them to be also alike in what I see not; for where is the hindrance or difficulty?

The translation spells out that the fix'd stars not only resemble the Sun but explicitly describes them as 'the Soul and Center of the World having Planets turning round it as that also has', emphasizing the analogy to the Sun and making the link more explicit than the original.","'je leur attribuë tout ce qu'il a' is a brief, elliptical statement ('I attribute to them all that [the Sun] has'). The translation expands this: 'I conclude they are Suns, and have Planets turning round about 'em; and every thing else we attribute to our Suns', making explicit for the reader the specific elements being ascribed, rather than leaving it to implicit reference.","'les Gens d'un autre grand Tourbillon ne le voyent que comme une petite Etoile Fixe, qui se montre à eux seulement pendant leurs nuits' is rendered as 'the Inhabitants of another Tourbillion, must only see our Sun as a small fix'd Star, which only appears to them, during their Night.' The English adds 'must only see', casting the speculative point as a necessary condition, and clarifies that the Sun appears only during the night for them, reinforcing the connection between astronomical phenomena and observable effects in a way the original leaves more implicit.","The French gives a flow of sentences: 'nôtre Soleil est si proche de nous en comparaison des Soleils des autres Tourbillons, que sa lumiere doit avoir infiniment plus de force sur nos yeux que la leur. Nous ne voyons donc que luy quand nous le voyons, & il efface tout; mais dans un autre grand Tourbillon c'est un autre Soleil qui y domine, & il efface à son tour le nôtre, qui n'y paroît que pendant les nuits avec le reste des autres Soleils étrangers, c'est-à-dire des Etoiles Fixes. On l'attache avec elles à cette grande voûte du Ciel, & il y fait partie de quelque Ourse, ou de quelque Taureau.' The translation explicates these relationships: 'when we see our Sun, we see nothing else, his brightness makes all other things disappear: In another great Tourbillion, where another Sun governs, he in his turn removes and darkens our Sun, which does not appear, but in the Night as a fix'd Star amongst the other strange Suns (that is) fix'd Stars, and our Sun appears to the Inhabitants of that Tourbillion in the great Vault of the Heavens, as a Star of some Constellation, such as the Bear or the Bull.' The English makes explicit the logic of visibility, the process of 'removing and darkening,' and the fact that 'the Bear or the Bull' are examples of constellations—details that in French are more succinctly alluded to.","'Pour les Planetes qui tournent autour de luy, notre Terre, par exemple, comme on ne les voit point de si loin, on n'y songe seulement pas.' is more implicit, while the English makes clear: 'As to the Planets which turn round about him (as our Earth for example) since they cannot see it at so great a distance, they do not so much as think of it.' The addition 'since they cannot see it at so great a distance' makes the cause of inattention explicit, clarifying the logic for the reader.","The French says, 'Dans leur Monde, ils sont uniques en leur espece, par tout ailleurs ils ne servent qu'à faire nombre,' a concise statement. The English expands this for clarity: 'for all the other, every one of them is the only one of his kind in his own World; but serve only to make up the Number of fix'd Stars for all the other Worlds,' spelling out the twofold status of the stars both in their own systems and as seen from elsewhere, whereas the French leaves it more elliptical and implicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est de deviner.

The explicit mention of the 'Hemisphere' clarifies a spatial reference which was implicit in the French.","The phrase 'an Infinity of little fixed Stars', while partially present in the French, is clearer here: the target version explicitly clarifies the nature of these stars as 'fixed', connecting the astronomical context more directly for English readers; 'fixed stars' was a technical expression of the time distinguishing them from planets.","The translator spells out the metaphor to make it more explicit for the reader: 'Maldevia-Islands, or those twelve thousand little Isles, or Banks of Sand, separate only by small Canals of the Sea, which one may over-leap with as much Ease as a Ditch.' The target text adds 'with as much Ease as a Ditch,' which is a more explicit comparison, making the metaphor clearer and more relatable, and the mention of 'small Canals' clarifies what could have been left vaguely as 'Canaux de Mer'.","The translator explicitly describes the interaction: 'may converse and shake hands with those of their Neighbouring World', spelling out two kinds of contact (conversing and shaking hands) whereas the original only says 'on pourroit se parler, ou même se donner la main' (could speak to each other, or even shake hands). The connection with 'neighbouring world' is now explicit, rather than just 'from one world to another'.","The English 'may teach Pidgeons to carry Letters, as they do in the Levant' adds the explanation 'teach' where the French 'dresser' might be less explicit for modern readers unfamiliar with the term; and the English keeps the geographic reference and explains the practice (pigeons used to carry letters), making the implied custom clear.","The target breaks the original sentence, which starts 'Ces petits Mondes sortent apparemment de la regle generale...' by introducing, 'By which, the Sun, in his own Tourbillion, as soon as he begins to spread his Light, he faceth that of all other Stranger-Suns; for if you were in one of these little Tourbillions of the Milky Way, your Sun wou'd not be so near to you; and by consequence, wou'd have but little more power, force, or influence upon your Eyes, than a hundred thousand other Suns of the neighbouring Tourbillions...' This section spells out more explicitly the mechanism ('as soon as he begins to spread his Light, he faceth that of all other Stranger-Suns') and the exact effect of the Sun on the eye of an observer, adding details implicit in the French.","The sentence in English ('you wou'd then see your Heaven shining with an infinite number of Fires, very near to one another, and not far distant from you') makes explicit the meaning of 'feux' as 'Fires', a term for stars, and emphasizes the proximity both 'to one another' and to the observer ('not far distant from you'), making the astronomical implication more obvious.","The English translation expands on the implications: 'and tho' you shou'd lose the sight of your own Sun, you wou'd still have Light enough, and your Nights wou'd be no less bright than your Days; at least, you wou'd not be sensible of the difference; or, to speak more properly, you wou'd have no Night at all:' This spells out that there is 'light enough', clarifies the degree ('no less bright than your Days'), and insists on the absence of night, which in the French is summarized as 'la differénce ne peut pas être sensible, & pour parler plus juste, vous n'avez jamais de nuit.' The English is more explicit about both the consequences and the experience.","The English considerably explicates the contrast with Earth's inhabitants: 'The Inhabitants of this World, accustom'd to perpetual Day, wou'd be strangely surpriz'd if one shou'd tell 'em, that there are several People in the Universe, who are under the Tribulation of dismal, real Nights, and who fall into long and profound Darknesses, and who, when the Light returns, behold one and the same Sun: They wou'd look upon such People as the Out-casts of Nature, and the very Thoughts of our sad Condition wou'd sieze them with Horrour.' Here, the translator adds interpretative phrases like 'several People in the Universe,' 'who are under the Tribulation of dismal, real Nights,' and clarifies 'one and the same Sun' for 'ne voyent même qu'un seul Soleil', making more explicit both the emotional effect ('the very Thoughts of our sad Condition') and the cosmological context."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P096: Je ne vous demande pas, dit la Marquise, s'il y a des Lunes dans les Mondes de la Voie de Lait; je voy bien qu'elles n'y seroient de nul usage aux Planetes principales qui n'ont point de nuit, &amp; qui d'ailleurs marchent dans des espaces trop étroits pour s'embarrasser de cet attirail de Planetes subalternes.

En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien.

Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement, des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez.

Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je.

Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas.</span></span> Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, il faut que l'espce se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement</span></span>, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, répliquai-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au-delà, il faudroit être plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent être ou n'être pas si on veut, ou être tels que l'on veut, il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P074: I understand you, said she, and am pleas'd with your Chamber of State; for we do not permit 'em to come directly in the middle of our Tourbillion, but receive 'em as the Grand Seignior does his Foreign Ministers; he does 'em not the Honour to lodge 'em in Constantinople, but sends 'em to the Suburbs. Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or false Light. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light? The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, and then farewell the Sun and all its Light. 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect. The Ancients were foolish to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience; but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener, but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is: Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever, yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? Eternity is not so easy a matter; and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish. Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them. If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other. Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie.

A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage', making explicit the analogy to European nautical voyages and spelling out the longer context of what the mariners are doing ('after a long Sea-Voyage'). Thus, it clarifies for English readers the emotional excitement and context that would be implied but unstated in the French.","The French uses a relative clause to describe variable appearance: 'tantôt ils nous présentent la moitié lumineuse, & qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantôt la moitié obscure, & qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus.' The English explicates with a more detailed, step-by-step process: 'as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em,' adding the explicit detail of 'upon their own Axis' and directly clarifying the observational consequence (see them/lose them), which is only implied in the French.","In the French: 'Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent & ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mêmes?' The translation expands the implied cyclicality with 'But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis?' The English makes explicit that the stars are expected to reappear after completing a rotation ('perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis'), spelling out the implied astronomical reasoning for their expected return.","The French uses a more condensed historical analogy about Roses and memory, but the English translation not only explains the analogy in greater length but also adds explicit reasoning: 'Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies', where the translator clarifies the implicit parallel between the Roses' faulty reasoning and the Ancients', spelling out the rhetorical lesson that was only suggested in the French.","The phrase 'les Mondes, les Cieux, & les Corps celestes si sujets au changement' is translated as 'the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change', making the implicit generalization about all celestial bodies being subject to change more explicit by grouping them and directly stating their susceptibility (in French, this susceptibility is implied by the context, but in English it is rendered explicit)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers!
