Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement.</span></span> La Lune estoit levée il y avoit Page 8] peut-estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moyndre Etoile</span></span>; elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps</span></span>; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante.</span></span> Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests</span></span>, fist aussi le mesme effet. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois?</span></span> Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux</span></span>; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriay-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes.</span></span> Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée.</span></span> Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle?

I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self. Well, says she, since your Folly is so delightful, pray let me have a share in it, I'l believe what you please of the Stars, provided I find pleasure in it. Ah! Madam, said I, 'tis not a pleasure like that which you find in a Comedy of Moliere; 'tis a pleasure, I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind. And pray, says she, do you think me incapable of pleasures that are only in the Reason; bring me acquainted with your Stars, and you shall presently see the contrary. No, said I, it shall never be laid to my charge, that in a Grove, at ten of clock at night, I entertain'd the most lovely person in the World with nothing but Philosophy, look out for such Philosophers elsewhere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it.</span></span> The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star</span></span>; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set.

The somewhat abstract phrase \"la chose m'y porte necessairement\" (the thing carries me there necessarily) is simplified to the more direct and common English \"the Subject leads me naturally to it.\"","The French literary subjunctive imperfect \"dérobast ou qui obscurcist\" (that might steal or obscure) is simplified to the more common English infinitive structure \"to rob us of, or obscure,\" using a less complex grammatical form.","The literary French inverted conditional past \"eussay-je resvé\" (would I have mused) is simplified to the standard English conditional structure \"I had long continued so,\" making the sentence structure more straightforward.","The French \"s'abandonner à\" (to abandon oneself to), implying a deep emotional surrender, is simplified to the more common and less intense \"withdrew my Admiration from,\" reducing the richness of the original emotional expression.","The French \"touchante\" (touching, moving), which carries emotional depth, is simplified to \"has more of charm.\" \"Charm\" is a more common and less emotionally nuanced word, simplifying the vocabulary.","The French verb \"touche\" (touches, moves emotionally) is translated as \"charm.\" This lexical choice consistently simplifies the emotional vocabulary, opting for a more common and less profound term.","The complex French literary past subjunctive conditional \"ne vous eust jamais jetté\" (would never have thrown you) is simplified to the simple past \"never put you.\" Additionally, the vivid \"prest de tomber\" (ready to fall into) is reduced to the more passive \"were now fallen into,\" simplifying the imagery and action.","The idiomatic French \"doivent estre dans ses interests\" (must be in its interests/on its side) is simplified to the more straightforward and common English phrasing \"are concern'd in it,\" making the expression less figurative and more direct.","The French \"de ce qui touche\" (of that which touches/moves) is simplified to \"of what is charming,\" a recurring lexical simplification reducing emotional depth. The \"ne ... que\" (only) construction in \"ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit\" is restructured to \"ever ... address themselves to the Night?\", simplifying the negative restrictive phrasing.","The French \"doux\" (soft, gentle, sweet), which has a rich semantic range, is simplified to \"pleasing.\" \"Pleasing\" is a more common and general term, reducing the specific sensory nuance of \"doux.\"","The clause \"où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir\" (into which one does not fall without pleasure), describing the experience of the disordered thoughts, is condensed and simplified to the adjectival phrase \"a certain pleasing disorder.\" This reduces a subordinate clause to an adjective, simplifying sentence structure and lessening the descriptive detail of the action.","The French causative construction \"me faire perdre de veuë\" (to make me lose sight of) is simplified to a more direct active clause \"when he takes from me the sight,\" making the grammatical structure less complex.","The vivid metaphorical French phrase \"mon imagination s'est échapée\" (my imagination escaped/ran away) is replaced by the literal and simpler statement \"I as soon discovered it\" (referring to his folly). This simplifies by removing figurative language and abstract imagery for a more direct statement.","The common French idiom \"je me suis mis dans la teste que\" (I've got it into my head that) is translated to \"I have had a fancy that.\" \"Have a fancy\" is a gentler, potentially more common term in polite literary English of the era, simplifying the somewhat more forceful imagery of the original.","The literary/archaic French subjunctive \"fust vray\" (were true) is simplified to the indicative \"'tis true.\" Also, \"je le tiens pour vray\" (I hold it for true), a somewhat formal assertion, is simplified to the more common \"that is my opinion.\" The impersonal \"il me fait plaisir à croire\" (it gives me pleasure to believe) is restructured to the active \"I find pleasure in believing it,\" a slightly simpler and more common construction in English.","The phrase \"qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante\" (that has placed itself in my mind in a laughing/smiling/cheerful manner) with its nuanced imagery is simplified. \"D'une maniere riante\" is reduced to the more general \"with delight,\" and the gentle reflexive \"s'est placée\" (placed itself) becomes the stronger \"taken possession.\" This simplifies the specific cheerful nuance of \"riante\" and changes the dynamic of the idea's presence.","The complex French syntax \"il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire\" (meaning 'even truths require pleasantness,' using an emphatic inclusion often involving double negative logic) is significantly simplified to the more direct English statement \"delight is not amiss even in Truth it self.\" This makes the sentence structure much clearer and easier to parse.","The adverb \"bien viste\" (very quickly), which describes the manner of speaking, is omitted in the translation. This simplification removes a detail, making the text slightly less dense.","The impersonal French pronoun \"on\" (one/people in general) in \"qu'on soit incapable\" (that one is incapable) is changed to the personal \"me\" (\"do you think me incapable\"). This personalization simplifies the statement by making it more direct and less abstract.","The French \"Je veux ... vous faire voir\" (I want ... to make you see / I want to show you), which emphasizes the Marquise's intention and agency, is simplified to \"you shall presently see.\" This changes the agent from the Marquise actively showing to the Philosopher passively seeing, and simplifies the causative \"faire voir\" structure to a direct verb \"see.\"","The French subjunctive \"j'aye parlé\" (that I spoke/should have spoken) after \"reproché que\" and \"que je connoisse\" (that I know - also subjunctive) are simplified. \"J'aye parlé\" becomes the indicative past \"I entertain'd,\" and the subjunctive nuance of \"connoisse\" is lost in the rephrasing (or its grammatical complexity removed). This shift from subjunctive to indicative simplifies the verb moods."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder.

Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera.</span></span> Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiete d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien, qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers; car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles.</span></span> Suposons qu'ils voyoient le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent, qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; &amp; cent autres resveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique? Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties. Avoüez la verité.

When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected.

Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages</span></span>, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers</span></span>, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente.

L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes.</span></span> Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal.</span></span> Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien.

Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">&amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter.</span></span> Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">&amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide.</span></span> Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">&amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit.</span></span> Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres.</span></span> Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage.

Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study.

Additionally, the subjunctive construction \"qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos\" is simplified to the indicative \"the Earth rests quiet,\" simplifying verb mood and tense.","The translation omits the phrase \"ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy\" (or by those who worked on it after him), reducing the informational content. Furthermore, the vivid and forceful expression \"il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible\" (it would throw you into a horrible fright) is rendered as \"it would have astonish'd you,\" which, while strong, is less graphic and arguably simplifies the emotional impact and imagery.","The French phrase \"dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes\" (with which one had encumbered/complicated the celestial movements) uses an active verb describing the effect of the circles. The English translation \"that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions\" rephrases this using the more abstract noun \"intricacy\" and the verb \"caused,\" simplifying the agency and making the expression less direct.","The French uses an inverted verb-subject construction \"Avoyent-ils nouvelle\" to imply a conditional or temporal situation (\"Should they hear of...\" or \"When they heard of...\"). The English translation simplifies this complex grammatical structure to a standard \"If they discover'd...\" clause, making the sentence more conventional and easier to parse. The addition of \"ready at hand\" also makes the implication of easily creating new crystal heavens more explicit, simplifying by clarification.","The complex French expression \"on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter\" (one took care not to even want to doubt it) involves a nuanced negation and the notion of willpower (\"vouloir\" - to want). The English translation \"it was no longer to be doubted\" simplifies this to a more straightforward passive statement, reducing the structural complexity and the psychological nuance of the original phrasing.","The French phrase \"il a falu se resoudre à\" conveys a strong sense of necessity and decision (\"one had to resolve to\" or \"it was necessary to decide to\"). The English translation \"it has been thought more convenient\" softens this imperative to mere convenience, thereby simplifying the force of the statement and using less direct vocabulary.","The translation simplifies the French \"absolument insoûtenable\" (absolutely unsustainable/untenable) to the slightly less emphatic \"not at all tenable.\" More significantly, it omits the specific qualifier \"par cet endroit\" (in this regard / on this point), reducing the precision and density of the original phrase.","The conditional and impersonal French construction \"Il sembleroit\" (It would seem) is simplified to the direct, personal, and present tense \"I see.\" Additionally, the clause \"où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres\" (where those who offer to do things at less cost, prevail over the others) is rephrased more colloquially and perhaps more simply as \"where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another,\" focusing on a more transactional and less abstract outcome.","The complex French sentence structure, which includes the detailed conditional subordinate clause \"quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien\" (even if this 'less' [saving] were almost nothing), is significantly condensed. The English translation simplifies this nuanced expression of extreme thriftiness to the more general phrase \"as may cost her little or nothing,\" reducing the sentence's density and the specific emphasis on minimal savings.","The emphatic French phrase \"Nous autres\" (We others), which distinguishes the speaker's group, is omitted in the translation. Furthermore, the descriptive and somewhat formal French clause \"nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées\" (we are prone to often overturn all that in our ideas) is simplified to the more concise and direct English phrase \"we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary.\"","The French clause \"qu'il ne faudroit\" (than would be necessary / than it should require), which employs a conditional verb form, is concisely simplified to the more common and shorter English phrasing \"than needs.\" This reduces the formal subjunctive construction to a simpler expression.","The idiomatic and forceful French expression \"fait main-basse sur\" (literally 'makes low hand on', meaning makes a clean sweep of, confiscates, or loots) is simplified to the more common and less figurative verb \"pull'd down.\" Additionally, the verb \"imaginez\" (imagined), referring to the creation of the heavens, is rendered as \"set up,\" opting for a more concrete and arguably simpler verb in this context.","The French causative construction \"se faisoit accompagner & environner\" (literally 'made itself to be accompanied and surrounded', indicating that the Earth was causing or allowing this accompaniment) is simplified. The English translation uses the more direct active verbs \"which attended and surrounded,\" reducing the structural complexity of how agency is expressed.","The French phrase \"il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme\" (an enthusiasm has just seized you) is rendered as \"you are fallen into an Enthusiasm,\" which is idiomatic. The simplification lies in the causative \"qui vous a fait expliquer\" (which made you explain), which becomes \"and explain.\" This removes the explicit causative grammatical structure, making the link between enthusiasm and the act of explaining less direct and more a simple conjunction of states/actions.","The French phrase \"aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit?\" (after it, what is it that follows?) is a more periphrastic and structurally complex interrogative form than the direct English question \"what follows next?\". The translation simplifies this structure, making the question more straightforward.","The French \"aussi employe-t-il plus de temps\" (therefore/so it employs more time) uses the verb \"employer temps\" (to use/spend time). The English translation \"and he likewise is longer\" simplifies this by expressing duration as a state (\"is longer\") rather than an action (\"employs time\"). The logical connector \"aussi\" (functioning as 'therefore' or 'so') is also softened to the less emphatic \"and...likewise,\" simplifying the vocabulary and the way consequence is expressed."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient.

This simplifies the expression by removing its emphatic and slightly emotional tone, a common practice in English translations of the period to tone down religious references.","The French phrase \"peut-estre sans s'en appercevoir\" (perhaps without realizing it), which adds a layer of psychological nuance about the philosopher's potential self-deception, is omitted in the English translation. This simplifies the characterization by removing this subtle detail.","The direct French interjection \"Franchement\" (Frankly) is replaced by the more general and less assertive \"Oh!\". Additionally, \"calomnie\" (slander) is rendered as \"scandal,\" a somewhat broader and potentially more common term, simplifying the specific legalistic implication of \"calomnie\".","The French adjective \"humiliant\" (humiliating), describing the effect of Copernicus's system on human pride, is translated as \"humble.\" This significantly changes the meaning, replacing a word describing a strong negative emotional impact with one describing a modest quality, thereby simplifying the concept being discussed.","The original French specifies that Copernicus decided to publish \"à la priere de Gens tres-considerables\" (at the request of very important/notable people). The English translation simplifies this to the more general and passive construction \"he was persuaded,\" omitting the specific agents and their status who prompted his decision, thus reducing the density of information.","The French logical connector \"enfin\" (after all / in short), which adds a summative or concluding nuance to the Marquise's argument, is omitted in the English translation. This slightly simplifies the argumentative flow of her statement.","The active French construction \"S'il [le Soleil] n'effaçoit point les Etoiles\" (If it [the Sun] did not erase/blot out the Stars) is changed to the more passive and less vivid \"if the Stars were then to be seen.\" Furthermore, the dynamic phrase \"en poussant ma veüe\" (by pushing my sight) is rendered as the more common and less forceful \"in looking on.\" These changes simplify the original's vivid imagery and dynamic language.","The French idiomatic expression \"oüy dire\" (to hear tell / to hear it said) is simplified to the more direct \"heard.\" This makes the expression more straightforward but loses the nuance of information received through hearsay or indirectly.","The French text states the philosopher \"s'écria à ceux qui le suivoyent\" (cried out to those who followed him). The English translation omits the phrase \"à ceux qui le suivoyent,\" thereby removing the explicit audience of the philosopher's exclamation. This simplifies the scene by reducing the number of details provided."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voye que des pas d'Amans, c'est à dire, vostre nom &amp; vos chiffres gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs.

This shift from a more abstract, indefinite subject to a direct personal one ('we') simplifies the phrasing by making it more concrete and relatable for the reader.","The French 'paroissent faire un tour' (appear to make a turn/revolution) is translated as 'roll about'. 'Roll about' is a more common, active, and vivid verb phrase. It simplifies the original phrasing by replacing the somewhat more formal and neutral 'paroissent faire un tour' with a more dynamic and easily visualized action.","The French uses a relative clause with a causative construction, 'la diverse maniere dont nostre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer' (the diverse manner in which our movement makes us encounter them). The English translation simplifies this to a prepositional phrase incorporating a gerund, 'the different manner of our meeting them in our motion.' This is a structural simplification, making the syntax more concise and arguably easier to parse by avoiding the nested clause and causative verb.","The French phrase 'qu'au fonds,' meaning 'fundamentally,' 'essentially,' or 'at bottom,' which carries a slightly more abstract or philosophical connotation, is translated to 'when really.' 'When really' is a more common, direct, and less nuanced colloquial expression, simplifying the original vocabulary for easier comprehension.","The French 'coûtast moins à la Terre' (literally 'cost the Earth less') employs a metaphorical expression. The English translation 'should be less troublesome to the Earth' makes the implied meaning more explicit and literal by using the common adjective 'troublesome,' thereby simplifying the figurative language of the original.","The French 'on ne l'a guere ménagée,' (one has hardly spared her / she has not been treated gently/carefully) is a nuanced idiomatic phrase referring to the burdens placed on the Earth. The translation 'She is not easily movable,' offers a simpler, direct statement about a physical characteristic. This simplifies by replacing a complex, somewhat abstract idiom with a concrete assertion, even though it alters the precise shade of meaning.","The French 'on luy demande bien de l'agilité..' (one demands much agility from her..) uses an active voice construction with the impersonal pronoun 'on' as the agent. The English translation 'it will require a good proportion of Agility.' shifts to an impersonal 'it' as the subject with the verb 'require.' This simplifies the sentence by removing the implied agent ('on') and utilizing a common, less personal English phrasing to express necessity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P010: Oh! repliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative.</span></span> Et croiriez-vous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">repris-je</span></span>, si vous n'en aviez point l'experience, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">que ce fust quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'un gros Navire monté de cent-cinquante pieces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une tres-grande nombre de Marchãdises?</span></span> Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">&amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire.</span></span> Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planetes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fust cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matiere celeste, &amp; ne s'y pas laisser emporter?</span></span> C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P008: Oh, says she, the Sun and Stars consist of fire, their motion costs them little; but the Earth seems not easily manageable.

This is simplified to the more neutral \"to attempt to swim,\" which reduces a layer of meaning regarding the speaker's perceived attitude.","The French reporting verb \"repris-je\" (I resumed/replied) is simplified to the more common and structurally simpler \"said I.\"","The French verb \"retrancherons\" (from \"retrancher\" - to cut back, remove, reduce) is translated using the more common and simpler English phrasal verb \"take them out.\"","The French reporting verb \"reprit-elle\" (she resumed/replied) is simplified to the more common and less formal \"says she.\"","The reporting verb \"repliquay-je\" (I replied) is simplified to \"says I.\" More significantly, the clause \"vous tournerez avec plaisir\" (you will turn with pleasure) is entirely omitted, which reduces the length and density of the text. Furthermore, the phrase \"vous vous ferez sur ce Systême des idées réjoüissantes\" (you will form for yourself on this System joyful/cheering ideas) is condensed and simplified to \"and have delightful Idea's of this System,\" changing \"form for yourself ideas\" to the lexically and structurally simpler \"have ideas.\"","The phrase \"sous mes yeux\" (under my eyes) is simplified to the more direct \"under me,\" reducing a degree of vividness. More notably, \"visages differens\" (different faces) is translated as \"different appearances.\" While the subsequent list describes human characteristics, \"appearances\" is a more general term than \"faces,\" potentially simplifying the initial, specific human-centric focus of \"visages.\"","The repetitive French structure using \"que je voy d'abord...\" (that I see first...) followed by multiple instances of \"& puis...\" (and then...) is simplified into a more varied and less rigidly structured English list: \"now..., then..., some..., others...\". This reduces lexical repetition and alters the formal, rhythmic parallelism of the original into a more flowing English enumeration, simplifying the stylistic device.","The highly repetitive French enumerative structure using \"tantost... tantost... tantost... tantost...\" (sometimes... sometimes... sometimes... sometimes...) is simplified by employing a varied series of connectors in English: \"by and by... then... next... then...\". This streamlines the original's marked parallelism, reducing stylistic complexity.

The English uses the more direct and idiomatic phrase \"it would be X well spent to Y,\" which simplifies the sentence structure by replacing the impersonal pronoun \"on\" and the subjunctive verb with a common adjectival phrase. This makes the sentence more accessible.","The translator omits the French phrase \"à present\" (at present/now). While \"where we are\" implies the present, the removal of the explicit temporal marker \"à present\" reduces the density of the text, making the English phrase slightly more concise and streamlined.","The French \"à le prendre dans l'air\" (literally \"to take it/considering it in the air\") is an idiomatic phrase that specifies a viewpoint or manner of consideration. The English translation \"in the same place in the Air\" simplifies this nuanced, slightly abstract phrase into a more concrete and direct prepositional phrase indicating location, reducing its complexity.","The translation simplifies the sentence structure by changing the French impersonal construction \"il y passe... d'autres Peuples\" (there pass... other Peoples) to an active voice construction with \"other people\" as the subject. This enhances directness and readability in English. Additionally, the term \"Peuples\" (which can imply distinct nations or groups, especially with 17th-century capitalization) is rendered as the more general and common \"people,\" simplifying the vocabulary and potentially reducing a nuance.","The translation uses more common vocabulary by rendering \"au bout de\" (at the end of) as \"in\". Furthermore, \"nous y revenons\" (we return there) is made more explicit as \"we return here again\". Specifying \"y\" (there) as \"here\" and adding \"again\" (though the verb \"revenons\" already implies repetition) enhances clarity and readability by reducing the inferential load on the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">D'abord il passera par icy des Anglois qui raisonneront peut-estre de quelque dessein de Politique</span></span> avec moins de gayeté que nous ne raisonnons de nostre Philosophie; ensuite viendra une grànde Mer, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">il se pourra trouver en ce lieu-là quelque Vaisseau</span></span> qui n'y sera pas si à son aise que nous.

The English \"all this you tell me\" simplifies this by using a demonstrative pronoun construction (\"all this\") and a simpler present tense verb, reducing clausal complexity and temporal specificity.","The French \"J'en aurais pour\" (implying \"J'aurais de la curiosité pour\" - I would have [curiosity] for them) is a construction involving the pronoun 'en'. The English \"particularly for\" simplifies this by being more direct and avoiding the pronominal construction, making the sentence flow more simply.","The French \"ne relâchent rien\" (literally \"release nothing\" or \"give up nothing\") is somewhat abstract in this context. The translation \"give no liberty at all\" makes the implied meaning (sexual liberty, in the context of \"faveurs\") explicit and uses more common phrasing for this specific idea, simplifying the reader's task of inference.","The formal causative French construction \"Cela est cause que...\" (That is the cause that...) is simplified to the more common and direct English \"That's the reason...\". Additionally, the impersonal French \"on prend davantage\" (one takes more) is simplified to \"they take more\", using a concrete personal pronoun.","The French \"peut-estre jusqu'à 20 lieües\" (perhaps up to 20 leagues) implies a potential upper limit. The English \"it may be twenty leagues or so\" uses the colloquial \"or so,\" which softens the precision of \"jusqu'à\" (up to) and introduces a sense of general approximation, simplifying the exactness of the measure.","The French phrase \"jusqu'à vinght lieües de hauteur tout au plus\" (up to twenty leagues in height at the very most) emphasizes a maximum limit. The English translation \"about twenty leagues high at most\" simplifies this by introducing \"about,\" which suggests a general estimate rather than a firm upper boundary, thus reducing the original's emphasis.","The French \"Vous me présentez la Terre sous des idées...\" (You present the Earth to me under ideas...) is a formal and elaborate construction. The English \"You give me... Idea's...\" simplifies this to a more common and direct phrasal verb. Furthermore, \"bien méprisables\" (very contemptible) is rendered as \"contemptible enough\"; \"enough\" can imply \"sufficiently,\" which is a slight softening and simplification of the directness of \"very.\"","The impersonal French constructions \"il se fait de si grands Travaux, de si grandes Guerres\" (such great Works, such great Wars are made/done) and \"qu'il regne ... une si grande agitation\" (that there reigns ... such great agitation) are simplified. The first is personalized to \"we labour and toil, and fight.\" The abstract \"une si grande agitation\" (such great agitation) which \"reigns\" is simplified to the more concrete and colloquial \"make such a noise on all hands as we do,\" reducing lexical and conceptual abstraction.","The French phrase \"n'entre point en connoissance de\" (literally \"does not enter at all into knowledge of\") is a formal and somewhat complex idiomatic expression. The English translation \"takes no notice of\" is a more common, simpler, and more direct idiom conveying a similar meaning, thus simplifying the vocabulary and the original's elaborate phrasing.","The French \"me sont un peu suspectes\" (are a little suspect to me) describes the precautions as the source of suspicion. The translation shifts this to a direct statement of the speaker's internal state: \"I am still very doubtful.\" This simplifies the indirectness of the original expression of doubt, making it more straightforward.","The French structure \"qu'il ne laissera pas quelque petite marque sensible à laquelle on le reconnoisse?\" (that it will not leave some small perceptible mark by which one recognizes it?) involves an active verb and a specific relative clause. The English \"it should not be discover'd by some little mark or other?\" uses a passive construction and simplifies the relative clause to a more general prepositional phrase with the colloquial softener \"or other,\" reducing grammatical complexity and specificity.","The French reflexive construction \"se font le moins sentir\" (literally \"make themselves felt the least\") is more grammatically complex than the English passive construction \"are least perceiv'd.\" The translation simplifies the sentence structure by opting for a more direct and common passive voice.","The French \"aussi bien en Voila assez\" (also/besides, there is enough of it) includes the pronoun \"en\" (of it/thereof). The English translation \"for this is enough\" simplifies this by omitting the equivalent of \"en,\" making the phrase more direct and slightly less grammatically dense."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: En retournant au Château je luy dis <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes</span></span>, qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Ticho- Brahé qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fust immobile, la plaçoit au centre du Monde, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planetes</span></span>, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planetes autour de la Terre.

The English translation simplifies this grammatically complex structure to a more direct coordinate clause joined by \"and\" and a prepositional phrase, enhancing readability by simplifying the sentence structure.","The French \"avoit bien envie de\" (had a strong desire/really wanted to) conveys strong intent. The English \"had a mind to\" is a more common and milder idiom, simplifying the vocabulary and reducing the intensity of the original expression.","The French \"il fut résolu que nous nous en tiendrions\" is a passive impersonal construction (\"it was resolved that we would stick to it\"). The English translation simplifies the sentence structure by changing it to an active voice (\"we resolv'd\"), making the agent explicit and the statement more direct.","The French \"riant\" (literally 'smiling' or 'laughing'), when describing a system, means attractive or pleasing in a nuanced, somewhat literary way. The English \"delightful\" is a more common and general adjective. This is a vocabulary simplification, opting for a more standard term which may slightly lessen the original's specific connotative richness.","The French \"la simplicité dont il est\" (the simplicity it possesses) uses a relative construction. The English \"the Simplicity of it\" simplifies this sentence structure to a more direct prepositional phrase. Additionally, the explicit address \"vous persuade\" (persuades you) is generalized to \"persuades,\" simplifying by removing the direct personal address.","The French \"vous fait plaisir\" (gives you pleasure) is a common periphrastic construction involving a direct address.

This simplification alters the emotional tone to something more colloquial and less stark, potentially making it more accessible.","Similar to \"repris-je,\" the French \"repliquay-je\" (I replied) is simplified to the more general dialogue tag \"said I.\" This again sacrifices the nuance of a specific type of reply (a more formal or direct retort than 'reprendre') for a more common and simpler term.","The French subjunctive mood in \"en qui cela soit une qualité considerable.\" (in whom that may be a considerable quality), used here to express a characteristic or potential quality, is translated with the English indicative \"is\" in \"in which that quality is considerable;\". This is a grammatical simplification, as the indicative form is generally more straightforward and common in English than the subjunctive mood, especially in such contexts.","The French construction \"il faut que la Terre renvoye aussi à la Lune la lumiere du Soleil\" (it is necessary that the Earth also send back [subjunctive] to the Moon the light of the Sun) is translated to \"it must needs be likewise, that the Earth sends [indicative] the Light of the Sun to the Moon.\" The shift from the subjunctive \"renvoye\" to the indicative \"sends\" simplifies the verb mood.

The translation \"to have requir'd so minute an explication\" uses a more direct active verb (\"requir'd\") instead of a complex causative construction, and rephrases \"tout au long\" to fit. This simplifies the grammatical structure and makes the Marquise's expression more direct.","The French uses a relative clause \"qui avons le jour\" (literally, \"who have the day\") to qualify \"nous\" (us). The English translation simplifies this to a more concise prepositional phrase \"in our day time,\" which reduces syntactic complexity and makes the description more direct for easier readability.","The key simplification here is the rendering of \"Voila donc\" as \"See there.\" The French \"Voilà donc\" serves as a conclusive marker, akin to \"So, there you have it\" or \"Therefore, behold.\" The English \"See there\" is a more immediate and imperative expression. This translation simplifies the French by reducing its formal, logical connective function and opting for a direct, demonstrative phrase, potentially enhancing engagement.","This segment translation involves multiple simplifications: 1. Lexical simplification: The somewhat literary French verb \"dérobe\" (steals, snatches away, deprives) is translated to the more common and simpler English verb \"hides.\" 2. Structural simplification: The French sentence structure, which preposes the indirect object for emphasis (\"à cette moitié lumineuse...\"), is rephrased into a more standard English word order (\"hides the Sun from...\"). 3. Clause simplification: The relative clause \"qui avoit le jour\" (which had the day / was experiencing day) is condensed into the simpler and more idiomatic adverbial phrase \"where it was day.\" These changes collectively reduce both lexical and structural complexity.","This segment features two distinct simplifications. Firstly, \"Voila donc\" is rendered as the more direct \"See there,\" reducing the formal conclusory tone of the original for immediacy (similar to the previous instance). Secondly, the descriptive relative clause \"pendant le jour dont elle joüissoit\" (during the day which it [the Moon] was enjoying/benefitting from) is significantly condensed to the concise prepositional phrase \"in her day.\" This reduces textual density and omits the specific nuance conveyed by \"joüissoit,\" prioritizing brevity and simplifying the end of the sentence.","The French construction \"Ce qui fait que X, c'est que Y\" (literally, \"That which makes it that X, it is that Y\") is a common way to express causality but is somewhat periphrastic. The English translation opts for the more direct and common phrasal structure \"The reason why X... is because Y...\".

The phrase 'un Arrest du Genre humain' (a Decree of Mankind/the Human Race), which is somewhat grand and philosophical, is rendered as 'a general Edict,' using more common and less abstract vocabulary. 2. The relative clause with a subjunctive verb 'qui défendît qu'on parlast jamais d'Eclipse' (that forbade that one should ever speak of an Eclipse) is transformed into a more direct participial phrase 'prohibiting, That none should ever speak of an Eclipse,' also replacing the impersonal 'on' with 'none.' 3. The phrase 'de peur que l'on ne conserve la memoyre' (for fear that one might preserve the memory), which uses an impersonal pronoun 'l'on', a subjunctive verb, and an expletive 'ne', is simplified to the more straightforward prepositional phrase with a gerund 'for fear of preserving the memory.' These changes collectively reduce both lexical and structural complexity.","The French text uses two coordinated subordinate clauses, 'que le mesme Arrest abolist la memoire de toutes choses' (that the same Edict should abolish the memory of all things) and '& défendist qu'on parlast jamais de rien' (and should forbid that one should ever speak of anything). Both employ subjunctive verbs ('abolist', 'défendist qu'on parlast'), and the second uses an impersonal 'on' construction. The English translation simplifies this structure significantly by using an infinitive phrase ('to abolish the memory of all things') followed by a verb with a gerund phrase ('and forbid ever speaking of any thing'). This conversion from full subjunctive clauses to non-finite verb forms streamlines the sentence and reduces syntactic complexity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P030: Dites-moy, je vous prie, une chose, dit la Marquise.

The English translation \"or the Greeks imagine\" omits the modal \"should\" (which was used for previous parallel clauses like \"should plunge\" and \"should think,\" and would typically translate the subjunctive imperfect here). This shift to a less modally marked verb form simplifies the consistent grammatical expression of the hypothetical scenario.","The French \"fussions ensorcelez\" (subjunctive imperfect passive, meaning 'that we might be/were bewitched') is dependent on \"s'imaginassent que...\". The English translation \"that we are inchanted\" uses the present indicative passive. This change from a subjunctive mood (expressing hypotheticality) to an indicative mood (expressing a more factual assertion within the imagined scenario) simplifies the grammatical nuance.","The French \"que nous allassions gâter\" (subjunctive imperfect, meaning 'that we might go/were to go to spoil') continues the series of subjunctive clauses. The English translation \"and go down to spoil their Herbs\" also omits the modal \"should\" that would typically convey the subjunctive sense in this context. This makes the action feel more direct, simplifying the grammatical expression of this part of the hypothetical list.","The French \"sans que nous leur en fassions?\" (literally 'without us doing it [making them afraid] to them?') uses a concise prepositional phrase with a subjunctive and an anaphoric pronoun \"en\". The English translation \"more than we have to scare them?\" rephrases this by making the idea of reciprocal rights more explicit and using a comparative structure, which simplifies the interpretation of the dense and somewhat idiomatic French construction.","The French \"Je croirois mesme\" (I would even believe) uses the conditional mood (\"croirois\") to express a more tentative or speculative assertion. The English translation \"And I believe\" uses the present indicative, which is a more direct and less nuanced statement, thereby simplifying the modality of the assertion.","The French \"que nous n'ayons quelque desavantage\" (following \"je crains que\" - I fear that) uses the subjunctive mood (\"ayons\") to express uncertainty or fear. The \"ne\" is an expletive \"ne\" and does not negate the clause. The English translation \"we have somewhat the disadvantage\" uses the indicative mood (\"have\"). This shift from subjunctive to indicative simplifies the grammatical expression of the feared possibility, making it sound more like a direct assertion of the state being feared."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P031: Ne craignez rien, répondis-je, il n'y a pas d'apparence que nous soyons <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">la seule sotte espece de l'Univers</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à estre generalement répanduë</span></span>, &amp; quoy que je ne fasse que deviner celle des Gens de la Lune, je n'en doute non plus que des Nouvelles les plus seures qui nous viennent de là.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P026: Fear not, said I, it doth not appear that we are the only foolish Species in the World.

While 'World' could also mean cosmos, it is a more common, Anglo-Saxon rooted term compared to the Latinate 'Universe.' This choice simplifies by using more familiar vocabulary, potentially at the cost of the grander scale or formal scientific precision of 'Univers.'","In the French phrase 'L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à estre generalement répanduë,' the term 'bien propre' means 'very suitable/apt.'

The English \"Time lost at Play\" simplifies this by using a common, more specific, and slightly interpretive idiomatic phrase, replacing the general verb construction with a familiar collocation.","The French causative construction \"qu'on fait faire\" (that one has made/causes to be done) is more complex. The English translation simplifies this to the more direct and structurally simpler phrase \"appointed,\" using a single past participle to convey the meaning.","The French \"les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes\" (the Verses that one presents to Princes) includes an active clause with the explicit indefinite pronoun \"on\" (one). The English simplifies this to a participial phrase \"Verses presented to Princes,\" omitting the explicit agent and reducing clausal complexity for conciseness."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sçais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune.

Were there none but you, Madam, said I, all those that have been address'd to you, are fled thither, and they are enough to make a considerable body. In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it. But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon. They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them.

This change lowers the register and simplifies the sentence's connective linkage.","The original French presents a rhetorically complex, ironic question: \"Guess what sort of thing one does *not* find in the Moon. [Answer:] Folly.\" (implying Folly is, in fact, abundantly found there). The translation changes this to a direct question \"what sort of thing *is to be found* in the Moon,\" which simplifies the question and removes the ironic playfulness intended by Fontenelle, making the meaning more literal.","The phrase \"En recompense\" (In return / On the other hand / As compensation), which provides a nuanced logical connection or contrast to the preceding text, is omitted in the translation. This omission simplifies the sentence by removing this connective element, thereby reducing textual density.","The French \"Je croy que...\" (I believe that...) frames the statement as the narrator's belief or interpretation. The English translation \"Ariosto sets them altogether\" presents this as a direct assertion, removing the subjective narrator's perspective and thus simplifying the narrative voice.","The nuanced French \"estoit de sa nature assez pesant\" (was by its nature rather/quite heavy) is simplified to \"was very heavy.\" This change uses a more common and direct intensifier (\"very\") and omits both the qualifier \"assez\" (rather/quite) and the descriptive phrase \"de sa nature\" (by its nature), resulting in a less detailed and more straightforward description.","The French idiomatic expression \"je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à...\" (I only have to expect to... / I can but expect to...) which conveys a specific nuance of resigned inevitability, is translated as \"I must expect to...\". This simplification uses a more direct modal verb (\"must\") that doesn't fully capture the original's subtle shade of meaning, making the expression plainer.","The French verb \"recueillir\" (to gather, collect), which has specific connotations of careful collection in \"permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres\" (permit that I gather it with my lips), is translated with the more general and common verb \"take\" in \"give me leave to take them with my Lips.\" This change simplifies the vocabulary, losing some of the original's descriptive precision.","The French \"il ne faut que des lévres qui sçachent le recouvrer\" (it only needs lips that know how to recover it) employs a relative clause (\"qui sçachent le recouvrer\"). The translation simplifies this structure to an infinitive phrase (\"to recover them\"), making the sentence grammatically less complex by removing the subordinate clause and the specific meaning of \"sçachent\" (know how to).","The French \"à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve\" is an emphatic and somewhat inverted construction meaning \"the inhabitants one finds there are barely men.\" The English translation \"we find the Inhabitants scarce Men\" simplifies this by using a more direct subject-verb-object structure with an adjective (\"scarce\"), enhancing readability by reducing structural complexity.","The original phrase uses \"pousser jusqu'à\" (to push on to/reach) and an emphatic final clause \"ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit\" (it would no longer be Men that one would find there). The translation simplifies this by using the more common verb \"go on to\" instead of \"pousser jusqu'à,\" and by rephrasing the complex emphatic clause into a more direct negative statement \"would not find them Men at all,\" reducing structural complexity and using more common vocabulary."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience?

Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper</span></span>, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit</span></span>, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit</span></span>; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer</span></span>, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste.</span></span> D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale.</span></span> Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eust dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Ameriquains plus propres à estre traversées? En verité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous estes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites.</span></span> Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes</span></span>; mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret</span></span> de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siecles à venir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou.</span></span> Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mestier</span></span>; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien.</span></span> Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont esté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">répliquay-je en éclatant de rire</span></span>, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">Les gens de la Lune sçavent peut-estre déja faire de petits voyages dans l'air</span></span>; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sçait quelle surprise. Vous estes insuportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celuy-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sçay bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien seurs que la Zone Torride, &amp; les Zones Glaciales <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur</span></span>, &amp; du temps des Romains la Carte generale de la Terre n'estoit guere plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes</span></span>, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors</span></span>, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">on découvre pourtant les Antipodes.</span></span> Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez-bien, Madame, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance</span></span>, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">Le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous</span></span>, on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre.</span></span> Quand nous aurons bien connu nostre habitation, il nous sera permis de connoistre <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune.</span></span> Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"25\">je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites.</span></span> J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"26\">qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique</span></span>, pour embarasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la verité qui persuade, mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans l'esprit, qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. Ah! vous me soulagez, repliqua la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"27\">vostre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal</span></span>, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P033: Oh! says she I reckon the Inhabitants of the Terra Australis as known; for 'tis certain they must needs resemble us very much, and in fine, we may know them when ever we take the pains to go see them, there they are and cannot avoid us; but the people of the Moon, we shall never know, 'tis that I despair of. If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it. Ah! says the Marchioness, you now give me some comfort; your fallacious reasoning made me sick.

Je ne me paye point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint Denis ressemble à Paris. Le Soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost un Païs, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert.</span></span> On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait.

The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not. From the moment that we have an interior motion in the parts of the Moon, or produc'd found by foreign causes, the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd, and we have a fund necessary for their subsistance.

The English translation changes the referent of the possessive ('of it') to the Moon (the main subject of the preceding clause: 'a body infinitely more hard...'), simplifying the referential path, albeit altering the original scientific argument.","The impersonal French construction 'il ne vous souvient plus que' (literally, 'it no longer reminds you that' or 'you no longer remember that') is simplified to a direct active question 'have you forgot that,' making the sentence structure more straightforward.","The French 'bien fâché' (very sorry) is translated as 'sorry for it,' omitting the intensifier 'bien' (very). This slightly reduces the expressed intensity and simplifies the phrasing.","The French clausal phrase 'De la distance ou nous sommes' (From the distance where we are) is condensed into the simpler prepositional phrase 'at this distance,' reducing structural length and complexity.","The French verb 'ombragent' (shade, cast a shadow over) is translated as 'darken.' 'Darken' is a more common verb in this active sense than 'to shade,' representing a simplification of vocabulary.","The somewhat literal French expression 'pousse point hors d'elle' (literally, 'pushes not out of herself') is simplified to the more common and idiomatic English phrasal verb 'send out.'","The French past tenses 'estoient separées' (were separated - imperfect) and 'ont rencontré' (have met - passé composé), used to describe a general scientific process, are shifted to the present tense ('are separated,' 'meet') in English. This simplifies the temporal structure by presenting the information as a timeless scientific fact.","The French 'se tiennent... dispersées' (keep themselves/remain dispersed) is simplified to 'are... dispersed.' More notably, 'imperceptibles' (imperceptible) is translated to 'invisible.' 'Invisible' is a more common term than 'imperceptible,' constituting a vocabulary simplification.","The French demonstrative pronoun 'celuy' (that one/the one [referring to 'mouvement']) in 'par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors' (by that which it receives from without) is replaced by the less specific quantifier 'some' in 'by some that it receives from without.' This generalization simplifies the pronominal reference.","The French future tense 'ne retomberont point' (will not fall back) is translated into the English present tense 'nor fall back,' aligning with the preceding present tense 'do not gather.' This tense harmonization simplifies the temporal structure of the hypothesis.","The French phrase 'en son particulier' (in its particularity, specifically, on its own), which adds a nuance about the specific nature of the Moon's atmosphere, is omitted in the English translation, simplifying the description by removing this subtle detail.","The vivid French presentative construction 'voila ses Habitans qui renaissent' (there are its Inhabitants who are reborn / behold, its Inhabitants are reborn) is rendered as the more standard declarative sentence 'the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd.' This simplifies the syntax by using a more conventional statement form.","The somewhat abstract French phrase 'à la maniere de la Lune' (in the manner of the Moon) is explicated and simplified to 'such as are in the Moon.' Additionally, the object of 'que je fais profession de ne pas connoistre' (which I profess not to know), originally 'la maniere de la Lune,' is clarified in English as 'of what sort they [the items] are,' simplifying for clarity.","The French phrase 'proportionné aux besoins de' (proportioned to the needs of) is translated as 'fit for the use of.'

This unpacking of the concise French idiom by adding \"in the matter\" makes the condition clearer and can be seen as a simplification for readability.","The French phrasing \"si on ne volera pas fort bien\" following \"que sçavons-nous\" uses a nuanced, somewhat idiomatic negative construction to express a speculative possibility (lit. 'if one will not fly very well'). The English translation \"but that in time we may fly well enough\" employs a more direct and common structure to convey this future possibility, simplifying the slightly more complex rhetorical turn of the French.","The French construction \"ce n'est pas la distance qui les en empesche,\" (it is not the distance that prevents them from it), which includes the pronominal adverb \"en\" referring to the action, is rendered more directly as \"not that the distance hinders them,\". This removes a layer of pronominal reference, simplifying the syntax.","The vivid French metaphor \"chacun a pour prison l'air qu'il respire\" (each has for prison the air he breathes) is simplified. The translation \"is confin'd to his own Air\" replaces the strong metaphor \"prison\" with the more general verb \"confin'd\" and omits the specific action \"respire\" (breathes). This reduces the metaphorical richness and specificity for a more direct and perhaps common phrasing.","The French subordinate clause \"dés qu'il entreroit dans nostre Air,\" (as soon as he would enter our Air,) is condensed into the prepositional phrase \"at his first arrival,\". This simplification reduces the clausal structure to a more concise phrase, making the sentence slightly less dense while conveying a similar immediate temporal meaning.","The French phrase \"sur la Terre\" (on the Earth), which specifies the concrete location of the fall, is replaced by \"before us.\" in the English translation. This shifts the perspective to the observers and omits the explicit geographical detail, thereby slightly reducing the informational density of the original text.

This is simplified to \"appears red,\" which removes these nuances, offering a more direct and less qualified color description.","The French phrase \"qui nous doit alterer la vraye couleur\" (which must alter for us the true color) is simplified to \"that changes the colour.\" This simplification involves replacing the modal verb phrase \"doit alterer\" (must alter) with the simpler indicative verb \"changes,\" and omitting both the indirect object pronoun \"nous\" (for us) and the adjective \"vraye\" (true), resulting in a more concise and direct expression.","Within this clause, the French noun \"alteration\" is translated as \"change.\" \"Change\" is a more common and generally simpler vocabulary choice than \"alteration\" in this context, enhancing accessibility.","The introductory adverb \"Enfin\" (Finally/In conclusion/In short), which begins the French sentence, is omitted in the English translation.

The English \"you drop\" is a simpler verb and slightly less dramatic, simplifying the original expression by using more common vocabulary.","The French \"assez grossieres\" (sufficiently/rather coarse/thick) is rendered as simply \"gross,\" omitting the qualifier \"assez\" (enough/rather). This simplifies the meaning by removing a degree of nuance about the thickness of the vapours, reducing textual density.","The French \"à quoy ressembleront les Belles...\" implies a loss of material for similes regarding the beauties (i.e., what will their comparisons be like, or what can they be compared to?). The English \"to what now must we resemble the fair ones...\" makes it an active question of how \"we\" will find comparisons. This simplifies the slightly more abstract or detached reflection in the French into a more direct question involving the speaker/observer.","The French uses a conditional \"n'aurois pas grand regret\" (I would not have much regret), a polite or attenuated expression.

The English \"the Stars are visible all night\" simplifies this to a direct, affirmative statement, enhancing readability by simplifying sentence structure.","The French \"paroist estre\" (appears/seems to be) is translated as a more definitive \"is.\" This simplification removes the subtle qualification that these phenomena merely *appear* to be effects of Heaven's anger, making the statement more direct and less speculative by simplifying vocabulary.","The French word \"délicieux\" (delicious, delightful, exquisite) is translated to the more common and less intense English word \"pleasant.\" This simplifies the vocabulary by choosing a word with a broader, less specific, and less evocative meaning.","The French describes these features as \"not valleys that are between mountains.\" The English translation simplifies this to \"they are not mountains?\", omitting the specific mention of \"valleys\" and their location (\"between mountains\"). This reduces descriptive detail and simplifies the negative comparison.","The French includes the participial phrase \"incommodez par l'ardeur perpetuelle du Soleil\" (bothered by the perpetual heat of the Sun) explaining the motivation.

The English translation simplifies this by using the indicative mood \"needs\" and \"will be,\" making the statement more direct and less hypothetical, thus simplifying sentence structure.","The French noun phrase \"pour la communication des Peuples\" (for the communication of the Peoples/Nations) describes the purpose of the paths. The English simplifies this by using the active verb phrase \"they communicate,\" focusing on the action rather than the abstract purpose and the distinctness of \"Peuples,\" making it more direct.","The French \"j'y consens de tout mon cœr\" (I consent to it with all my heart) is somewhat more passive or general. The English \"I heartily agree you should\" is more active and explicit by adding \"you should\" (referring to her laughing), simplifying the interpretation for the reader by making the object of agreement clear.","The French \"parce que nous habitons\" (because we inhabit) is rendered as the more concise English idiom \"as we do.\" This simplification reduces the explicit causal conjunction and verb phrase to a common, shorter comparative phrase, simplifying sentence structure.","The French \"puisque\" (since, given that) establishes a premise for Fontenelle's inverted logic (i.e., *because* we do X, they might do the opposite of X, as a principle of difference). The English \"though\" introduces a concessive clause, which simplifies or alters this specific rhetorical and logical link by presenting our situation as a contrasting point rather than a direct premise for their opposite behavior. This simplification affects the argumentative subtlety.","The French \"D'icy là\" is a concise phrase that can mean \"from here to there\" spatially or \"consequently\" logically. The English translation \"here from what they are there\" explicitly clarifies the spatial/comparative meaning, simplifying the interpretation by removing ambiguity and making the reference more direct."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle.

This is simplified to the more abstract phrase \"that trouble,\" reducing the vividness and spatial concreteness of the original.","The French construction \"on croit avoir assez pourveu ... de les avoir transportées\" (one believes to have sufficiently provided... by having transported them) uses a complex infinitive structure. The English simplifies this to a passive main clause (\"'tis thought sufficient provision is made\") followed by a more straightforward prepositional phrase with a gerund (\"by mutually transporting them\"), improving structural clarity.","The personal and more intense French expression \"Ce Voyage me réjoüit quelquefois beaucoup\" (This voyage sometimes greatly delights me) is simplified to the impersonal and less emphatic \"'tis a pleasure.\" This change reduces the emotive detail by omitting the personal pronoun and adverbs of frequency and intensity.","The French text employs several complex conditional verb forms (e.g., \"il faudroit concevoir\", \"auroient esté faits\", \"seroit\"). The translation simplifies these to more direct indicative tenses (\"are made\", \"that's\") or simpler modal constructions (\"we must conceive\"). The final clause is also rephrased from an abstract conditional (\"qu'il y auroit une exception...en faveur de...\") to a more concrete statement (\"the Earth only was exempted from it\"), reducing overall grammatical intricacy.","The French \"Je viens de voir le moment que la Lune seroit deserte\" (I have just seen/experienced the moment when the Moon would be deserted) uses a personal construction and the conditional \"seroit\". The translation \"it is not long since the Moon was made a Desert\" simplifies this by using an impersonal construction and the simple past tense \"was made\", reducing modality and personal perspective.","The French phrase \"comment ils estoient tous faits\" (how they were all made), using the imperfect tense, suggests a state or process in a past hypothetical context. The English translation \"how they are all made\" simplifies this by shifting to the present tense, making the description more immediate but losing the past temporal framing.","The French phrase \"je ne laisse pas de trouver qu'il seroit bien étrange\" (I do not fail to find / I nevertheless find that it would be very strange) is a somewhat elaborate idiomatic construction. This is simplified in English to the more direct \"I think it would be very strange.\" Additionally, the French imperfect subjunctive forms (\"fust\", \"fussent\") are rendered with the simpler \"should be\" construction.","The French \"que la simple veuë ne sçauroit appercevoir\" (that simple sight would not know how to/could not perceive) uses a modal conditional verb construction. The English translation \"which are not discernable to our plain sight\" simplifies this to a more direct adjectival phrase, stating a fact of non-discernibility rather than conveying nuanced incapacity.","The French structure uses imperatives followed by the presentative \"voilà aussi-tost...\" (there are immediately...). The English translation shifts this to \"...and you shall presently see...\", making the outcome a direct, predicted observation for \"you\" (the reader).

The English translation simplifies this complex sentence structure by: (1) converting the relative clause 'qui y connoissent des Montagnes & des Abismes' into a new, coordinated clause 'there they find Mountains and Abysses,' thus breaking the chain of subordination; and (2) replacing the noun phrase with a relative clause 'les autres Vermisseaux qui y vivent' with the more concise pronominal phrase 'those on the other side.' These changes enhance readability by reducing syntactic complexity and density.","The French original employs a rhetorical interrogative ('sera-t-elle...?') to deliver a strong assertion, a common stylistic feature of Fontenelle. The English translation simplifies this by using a declarative sentence with the modal verb 'may be' ('a great Planet may be...'). This modification makes the statement more direct and less stylistically marked, reducing the rhetorical complexity of the original.","The French text includes the descriptive clause 'qu'ils rongeoient' (which they were gnawing), specifying how the worms consumed the stone. The English translation omits this clause, thereby simplifying the sentence by reducing its informational detail and length.","The French 'que de n'y en pas mettre' is a concise but somewhat complex idiomatic negative infinitive construction ('than to not put any there'). The English translation recasts this part by fronting the condition and using a more explicit phrasing: 'rather than there should be no Inhabitants.' This restructuring and more direct statement of the negative condition simplifies the original's denser phrasing, enhancing clarity.","The French clause 'que l'on en vist seulement la moitié' utilizes the imperfect subjunctive 'vist' (that one saw/might see), a grammatical mood and tense that can be complex.

This simplifies the sentence's perspective and the expression of modality.","The original French \"si vous voulez\" (if you wish/like) is a direct, conversational address, maintaining the dialogic nature of the text. The English \"for example\" is a more impersonal and standard phrase, simplifying the interactive tone and reducing the stylistic richness of the original conversational style.","The French impersonal construction \"il faudroit ... trouver\" (it would be necessary to find), using the conditional to express necessity or a hypothetical task, is simplified. The English changes to a personal \"we\" and uses \"may ... find,\" shifting from necessity to possibility. This simplifies both the grammatical structure (impersonal to personal) and the modal nuance.","The French phrase \"pour varier en tant de manieres\" (in order to vary in so many ways) is condensed to the more concise \"in framing such variety.\" This simplification reduces the explicitness about the diverse methods of variation, focusing more on the result.","The French \"dans une autre Planete, c'est une autre Famille\" uses an introductory prepositional phrase followed by \"c'est...\" (it is...).

The translation \"to remit them\" simplifies this structure by employing a single verb with a direct object, resulting in a more concise and grammatically direct expression, even if \"remit\" itself is not necessarily simpler vocabulary.","The original French uses the future perfect tense (\"auront ... servie,\" \"auront appris\") to describe actions that will have been completed in the future relative to another future event (\"Nous verrons demain\").

The translation \"to influence the Loves\" uses a more common verb (\"influence\") and suggests a softer, less direct, and arguably more easily understood type of agency, thus simplifying the conceptualization of the Moon's role.","The French \"menu Peuple\" (common people, ordinary folk) is translated to \"the little people.\" This simplifies the socio-lexical register by using a more colloquial and arguably more accessible term, though it may also shift the nuance slightly.","The French phrase \"une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur\" (a more lively light and more heat) is rendered as \"a Light more lively and hot.\" This simplifies the structure by changing the noun phrase \"plus de chaleur\" (more heat) into the common adjective \"hot,\" making the expression more concise and direct.","The French adjective \"brillante\" (shining, brilliant) is translated to \"sparkling.\" While \"brilliant\" is a cognate, \"sparkling\" is arguably a more common, vivid, and less formal adjective in this descriptive context, simplifying the vocabulary towards more readily accessible imagery.","The French \"valent les plus belles de Clesie\" (are worth/are equivalent to the most beautiful [conversations] of Clélie) is translated as \"is beyond the most polite of Clelia,\".

The translation simplifies this structure and meaning: 1. It condenses 'faisant des Vers, aimant la Musique' into a single, more idiomatic adjectival phrase 'given to Poetry and Musick,' which describes a general disposition rather than two separate active engagements, streamlining the list. 2. It replaces 'inventant tous les jours des Festes, des Danses, & des Tournois' (inventing festivals, dances, and tournaments every day) with the gerunds 'every day Feasting, Dancing and Tilting.' This shifts the meaning from the act of *creating* or *devising* these events daily (implied by 'inventant') to simply *engaging* in them, using more common verbs for these activities and simplifying the described intellectual effort.","The French sentence uses a conditional perfect tense ('n'auroient esté' - would have been) and the prepositional phrase 'auprés d'eux' (literally 'beside them', meaning 'in comparison to them'). The English translation simplifies these aspects. Firstly, the verb tense is simplified from the conditional perfect 'n'auroient esté' to the conditional present 'would be', reducing the complexity of the hypothetical state being described. Secondly, the nuanced comparative phrase 'auprés d'eux' is rendered as the more direct and concise 'to them'. While the English sentence also reorders the concluding French phrase ('pour la froideur & pour la stupidité') to an earlier position as 'for the coldness and stupidity of their Temper' and adds minor explicitations ('of their Temper', 'people of'), the primary simplifications contributing to easier readability are the change in verb tense and the more straightforward rendering of the comparison."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P058: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Mais que sera-ce des Habitants de Mercure?</span></span> Ils sont encore plus proches du Soleil; il faut qu'ils soient fous à force de vivacité.

If interpreted (as the subsequent text implies) that the reason is *not* lacking, the English \"the cause is clear\" directly states this assumed outcome, simplifying the original's rhetorical indirectness and potential subtlety.","The French \"de là elle revient à la rencontre de tout ce qui est solide\" uses more elaborate phrasing, describing the light's movement as \"from there it returns to the encounter of\" solid objects. The English \"where ever it meets with any thing that is solid, it reflects\" simplifies this to a more direct statement of circumstance and consequence, reducing the figurative richness and descriptive detail of the light's specific action of 'returning to meet'.","The French uses three distinct verbs \"se croisent\" (cross each other), \"se traversent\" (traverse each other), and \"s'entrelassent\" (interlace/entwine each other) to describe the complex interaction of light trails. The English translation \"cross and traverse one another\" omits a direct equivalent for \"s'entrelassent,\" simplifying the description by reducing lexical density and the specific imagery of interlacing.","The French phrase \"On est bien embarrassé à le dire\" conveys a strong sense of being \"quite puzzled\" or \"very awkward/embarrassed\" to state the Sun's nature. The English \"is hard to say\" simplifies this by using a more common, less intense, and less emotionally nuanced expression, reducing the original's stylistic richness.","The French \"on s'en desabusa\" (one was disabused of it / one's illusion was dispelled) emphasizes the active process of people realizing their previous error. The English \"that opinion vanish'd\" uses a more abstract phrasing that personifies the opinion and describes its disappearance somewhat passively, simplifying the human agency involved in the shift of understanding.","The original French sentence presents three coordinated causal clauses starting with \"Comme...\" and \"que...\" explaining the judgment about sunspots. The English translation omits the third causal clause: \"& qu'enfin les nouvelles Planetes s'estoient mises à la mode\" (and that finally the new Planets had come into fashion). This omission simplifies the complex sentence structure by reducing the number of contributing reasons and removes a specific socio-cultural observation about scientific trends, thereby reducing the text's density.","The French \"n'avoit l'esprit remply d'autre chose\" (literally \"had its mind/spirit filled with nothing else\") is translated into the more colloquial and idiomatic English phrase \"busied their Brains about nothing else.\" This simplifies the original's more formal and slightly abstract vocabulary by using a common, vivid expression, making the language more direct.","The French \"faisoient leur Cour de ces pretendües Planetes à...\" (literally \"were paying court with these pretended planets to...\") implies seeking favor, possibly through flattery but can be broader. The English \"began their Flattery with...\" makes the act of flattery explicit and central. This simplifies the original expression by removing the slight ambiguity or broader connotation of \"faire la cour\" and opting for a more direct and unambiguously interpretive term.","The French phrase \"à qui seroit demeuré le maistre des taches pour les nommer comme il eust voulu...\" (as to who would have remained master of the spots to name them as he would have wished...) describes the power dynamic and prerogative over naming. The English translation \"what Prince should be Godfather to the chief of those Spots.\" simplifies this by replacing the more abstract notion of \"mastery for naming\" with the more concrete, culturally familiar, and slightly jocular role of \"Godfather,\" and by adding the detail \"chief of those Spots,\" making the scenario more vivid but altering the original's focus."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

This simplifies the temporal nuance, making the statement about the usability of sunspots more general and immediate rather than tied to a specific past attempt or realization.","The translation changes the French imperfect tense \"n'estoient point\" (were not), which describes a past state at the time of discovery, to the English present tense \"are not\". This shift simplifies the temporal perspective, presenting the nature of sunspots as a current, established fact rather than framing it within the narrative's timeline of discovery.","The French phrases \"en grande quantité\" (in great quantity) and \"en petit nombre\" (in small number) are simplified to the more common and concise English words \"many\" and \"few\".","The French construction \"Il y a des temps où l'on en voit beaucoup\" (There are times when one sees many of them) is simplified to \"sometimes many of them are seen.\" This changes the impersonal \"l'on en voit\" (one sees) to a passive voice and uses the more common adverb \"sometimes\" instead of the clausal \"Il y a des temps où\" (There are times when).","The French impersonal passive-like construction \"puis il s'en produit d'autres\" (then others of them are produced / then more are produced) is simplified to an active voice construction \"and he afterward produces more,\" with \"he\" (the Sun) as the explicit agent. This makes the sentence more direct and its agent clearer.","The French construction \"Il y en a tel qui est peut-estre...\" (There is such a one of them that is perhaps...) is simplified to the more direct and common English phrasing \"some of them are, it may be...\". This avoids the slightly more formal and less direct \"tel qui\" construction.","The somewhat vague French phrase \"quelque chose qui arrive dans les Lunettes\" (something that happens in the telescopes) is translated as \"some accident in the Telescope.\" The word \"accident\" simplifies by providing a more specific lexical choice than the general \"something that happens,\" making the idea more concrete and readily understood.","The French \"C'est pourtant dommage\" (It is however a pity/shame) is translated as \"which certainly is a great loss.\" This changes the concessive/regretful nuance of \"pourtant\" (however/yet) to an emphatic \"certainly\" and intensifies \"dommage\" (pity/shame) to \"a great loss.\" This makes the statement more direct and less understated, simplifying the emotional expression.","The translation omits the phrase \"de leur mouvement\" (of their movement) from the original \"au centre de leur mouvement.\" This shortens the phrase and relies on the preceding context to imply what \"Center\" refers to, thereby reducing the explicitness and density of the original text.","The French \"verroit rien\" (would see nothing) is rendered as \"would see nothing at all.\" The addition of \"at all\" is an intensifier not explicitly present in the original \"rien\" (which in older French could stand alone for 'nothing' in such constructions), making the negation more emphatic and absolute. This can be seen as a form of simplification by ensuring the extent of \"nothing\" is fully and easily grasped.","The French verb \"effacer\" (to erase, wipe out, make indistinct) is translated with the simpler and more common English verb \"hide.\" While \"efface\" exists in English, \"hide\" uses more common vocabulary, reducing the lexical formality.","The French idiomatic and somewhat formal phrase \"seroient bien fondez à se croire\" (literally, \"would be well-founded to believe themselves\") is translated into the more common and slightly more analytical English phrase \"would indeed have good reason to believe themselves.\" This simplifies the idiomatic structure into a more readily understandable phrasing. The addition of \"So\" at the beginning also simplifies the logical connection to the preceding sentence."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P063: J'avoüe que je m'estois trompé, répondis-je, je ne songeois qu'à la situation où est le Soleil,&amp; non à l'effet de sa lumiere; mais vous qui me redressez si à propos, vous voulez bien que je vous dise que vous vous estes trompée aussi; les Habitans du Soleil ne le verroient seulement pas.

Additionally, the idiomatic and slightly more descriptive \"retourner sur nos pas\" (retrace our steps) is rendered as the more common and straightforward \"return,\" simplifying the vocabulary.","The French \"valent\" (are worth/equivalent to) is translated as \"are as long as.\" While \"valent\" is not inherently complex, \"are as long as\" is a more common and direct English idiom for expressing duration.

All that great mass of celestial matter from the Sun to the fixed Stars turns round and carrying the Planets with it, makes them turn all uniformly about the Sun, which possesses the Center, but in more or less time, according as their distances are more or less from him.

Additionally, the phrase \"il est beau de sçavoir\" (it is a fine thing/good to know), which implies worthiness, is simplified to the more common and affectively simpler \"'twill be pleasant to know.\"","The French \"Achevez de me rendre folle\" (Finish making me mad/crazy) expresses a stronger, more dramatic emotion. The English \"pray make an end of fooling me\" uses more common vocabulary (\"fooling me\") and simplifies the intensity of the Marquise's statement.","The French expresses a dual concept: abandoning self-preservation (\"je ne me ménage plus\") and abandoning formal restraint regarding philosophy (\"je ne connois plus de retenuë\"). The English simplifies this into more general phrasing: \"I can no longer govern my self\" is a common expression for losing self-control, and \"nor muse longer upon Philosophy\" uses a common verb (\"muse\") that softens and simplifies the idea of casting off \"retenuë\" (restraint/reserve).","The French idiomatic expression \"laissons parler le monde\" (let the world/people talk, implying disregard for societal opinion) is simplified to \"let us leave talking of the World,\" which changes the meaning to merely switching conversational topics. Further, the figurative and intense \"donnons-nous aux Tourbillons\" (let's give ourselves up to/devote ourselves to the Vortices) is simplified to the much plainer and more common instruction \"and begin with these Vortices.\"","The French uses the plural noun \"emportemens\" (strong outbursts of passion/enthusiasm), suggesting a capacity for such states. The English \"so transported\" uses an adjective describing her current state, which is a simpler grammatical construction and employs a more common term for being carried away by emotion, reducing the specific force of \"emportemens.\"","The French \"c'est dommage qu'ils n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet\" conveys a subtle, flirtatious regret that the Marquise's passions are *only* directed at Vortices (implying they might be directed elsewhere, e.g., at the speaker). The English translation simplifies this complex emotional and situational nuance into a more straightforward, although semantically different, statement. The English structure is simpler than the French subordinate clause but sacrifices the specific cultural nuance of gallantry.","The French definitional structure \"Ce qu'on appelle un Tourbillon, c'est...\" (That which one calls a Vortex, it is...) is a common but slightly more periphrastic phrasing. The English \"A Vortex is...\" simplifies this to a more direct and concise sentence structure.","The French uses an impersonal passive construction \"permis à elles\" (it being permitted to them) and the somewhat formal temporal phrase \"pendant ce temps-là\" (during that time). The English translation changes this to the more direct, active, and conversational \"you must allow them\" and the common phrase \"in the mean time.\" This simplifies the formal, detached tone and grammatical structure by using direct address and more common vocabulary.","The French structure \"Ainsi un Tourbillon de vent, c'est...\" (Thus a whirlwind, it is...) includes a resumptive pronoun \"c'est,\" which is a common feature of French syntax for emphasis or flow. The English translation \"So a Whirlwind is...\" omits this, resulting in a more direct and streamlined sentence structure typical of English, thereby simplifying the slightly more complex French phrasing.","The French descriptive phrase \"en un mesme sens\" (in the same direction/manner) is translated to the single adverb \"uniformly.\" While \"uniformly\" is not necessarily simpler vocabulary in isolation, its use here condenses a prepositional phrase into a single adverb, streamlining the sentence and making the expression more compact.","The French \"vous remarquerez en passant\" (you will notice in passing) uses the future indicative, politely predicting an observation. The English translation \"you must observe by the way\" changes this to a more direct and instructional tone using \"must observe,\" simplifying the nuanced politeness of the original phrasing.","The French phrase \"que quand la Terre seroit dans la place où il est\" (that if the Earth were in the place where it [the Sun] is) contains a reference (\"où il est\") that the reader must resolve. The English translation \"that were the Earth in the Center\" simplifies this by making the location explicit (\"in the Center\"), thereby enhancing clarity and reducing the interpretative step for the reader.","The French \"elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle-mesme\" includes the word \"encore\" (still/yet), which is omitted in the English \"it could do no less than turn upon its own Axis,\" slightly reducing textual density. Furthermore, the general phrase \"tourner sur elle-mesme\" (to turn on itself) is rendered as the more scientifically specific \"turn upon its own Axis.\" In the context of popularizing science, this specification clarifies the abstract notion of self-rotation, simplifying comprehension by providing a more concrete image of the motion."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P065: Voila quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme le Maistre; mais en mesme temps les Planetes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">se composent de</span></span> petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de celuy du Soleil.

The English simplifies this to the direct affirmative verb \"turn\" in \"turn about the Sun,\" removing the stylistic complexity and making the assertion more straightforward.","The French reflexive causative \"nous nous fismes suivre par la Lune,\" (we caused ourselves to be followed by the Moon) is a grammatically more complex structure. The English translation \"we made the Moon follow us,\" uses a simpler, more direct active causative construction, enhancing readability.","The French \"tout à fait à nostre bienséance.\" (entirely at our convenience/suitability/disposal) is a relatively formal and somewhat abstract term. The English \"wholly at our devotion.\" uses a more common and vivid idiomatic phrase of the period to express subservience, simplifying the original's abstractness with a more concrete image of allegiance.","The French phrase \"que nous l'eussions esté,\" (that we would have been *it*), which uses an anaphoric pronoun \"l'\" to refer to a previously implied state (being subjected), is made more explicit in the English translation \"he would have subdu'd us likewise,\". By restating the verb \"subdue,\" the translation reduces referential ambiguity and simplifies comprehension.","The French \"une Lune de sa dépendance,\" (a Moon of his dependence) uses a noun phrase involving an abstract noun (\"dépendance\") to describe the Moon's status. The English \"a Moon attending on him:\" replaces this with a more active and descriptive participial phrase, creating a more concrete and easily visualized image of subservience, which simplifies the abstract French.","The French \"une qui est dans la nostre,\" (one which is in ours – implying \"our dependence\" or \"our vortex/control\") is concise and relies on inference. The English \"one of our own attending on us,\" is more explicit by specifying possession (\"of our own\") and using the active phrase \"attending on us.\" This reduces the inferential load for the reader, simplifying by making the meaning more self-contained and descriptive.","The French impersonal pronoun \"on\" in \"qu'on doit avoir.\" (that one is to have) is rendered as \"a man\" in \"of a man.\" This shift from a general, impersonal pronoun to a more specific noun (a common practice in older English for a generic person) makes the statement more concrete, which is a form of simplification by reducing abstraction."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes?

'Move' is a more general and common verb, representing a simplification of vocabulary by choosing a less specific and more frequently encountered term.","The French temporal clause 'quand on met de l'huile avec de l'eau' (when one puts oil with water) is simplified to the more concise prepositional phrase with a gerund, 'in mixing Oil & Water.' This change reduces sentence complexity by eliminating an explicit subject ('on') and verb for this part of the action.","The French impersonal subjunctive construction 'Qu'on mette' (Let one put / If one puts) is translated as a conditional clause using 'you' ('and if you lay'). This shift from the impersonal 'on' (one) to the direct address 'you' simplifies the formality of the text and makes the instruction more accessible and engaging for the reader.","Similar to the previous instance, the French impersonal subjunctive 'Qu'on y mette' (Let one put there / If one puts there) is rendered as a more direct conditional clause with 'you' ('but if you add'). This simplification reduces formality and enhances readability by personalizing the scenario for the reader.","The French relative clause '& qui soit justement d'une certaine pesanteur' (and which is/be precisely of a certain weight) is simplified. The adverb 'justement' (precisely, exactly) is omitted, reducing emphasis and textual density. The English 'of a certain weight' directly modifies 'body more heavy,' resulting in a more concise and less overtly clausal structure.","The French hypothetical subjunctive forms 'Qu'on mette' (Let one put / If one puts) and 'qu'on y plonge' (let one plunge there / if one plunges there) are simplified to direct imperative forms 'put together' and 'put in.' This change simplifies the grammatical structure by using a more direct mood, making the instructions easier for the reader to follow.","The French verb 'plonger' (to plunge, immerse, dip) is translated as 'put in.' 'Put in' is a more common and general phrasal verb, simplifying the vocabulary compared to the more specific 'plonge' or its direct English equivalents like 'plunge' or 'immerse.'","The translation omits the introductory conversational French phrase '& vous voyez bien que' (and you see well that / and you understand that).

The English simplifies this by using the more concrete noun \"Regulation\" and effectively condensing the two functional ideas. The first function (regulating) is absorbed into the noun phrase \"some such Regulation among us,\" and the sentence proceeds with a single relative clause for the second function (\"that might fix people\"). This reduces syntactic complexity by decreasing the number of explicit verbal clauses modifying the core idea, thereby enhancing directness and readability.","The French \"nostre Lune unique\" uses the single adjective \"unique\" (sole, only one of its kind). The English translation \"our one only Moon\" replaces this with the two-word phrase \"one only.\" This can be seen as a simplification because it uses two very common, arguably more elemental words (\"one,\" \"only\") to express the concept of singularity, potentially making it more immediately obvious or emphatic for a general reader compared to the single, Latin-derived \"unique.\" This choice prioritizes directness and common vocabulary for popular accessibility.","The French \"Me voila fort en repos\" (literally \"Here I am, very much at rest/peace\") uses an idiomatic presentative construction. The English \"You see me now well satisfy'd\" simplifies this by: 1.

The English \"people are certain\" states the outcome directly, simplifying by omitting the nuance of the active process of 'making sure' and the thoroughness implied by \"bien\".","The French \"la veüe à peine peut-elle encore l'attraper\" personifies \"sight\" (la veüe) actively struggling to \"catch\" (attraper) the Earth, with \"encore\" adding emphasis (still/even). The English \"scarcely is it discernable\" uses a more passive, abstract construction focusing on the Earth's state (\"it is discernable\"), simplifying the vivid metaphorical imagery and the active role of \"sight.\" The nuance of \"encore\" is also diminished.","The French \"je croy que cela est\" (I believe that that is / is so) contains the explicit assertion \"cela est\". The English \"I believe that,\" omits the final verb \"est\" (is) from the object clause, making it less emphatic and more concise. This simplification results in a more common English colloquial expression but loses the full explicit statement of belief present in the French.","The French phrase \"à composer des Lunettes excellentes\" (to compose/construct excellent telescopes) uses the verb \"composer.\" While accurate for construction, \"composer\" is somewhat more formal or less frequently used in general parlance than \"make.\" The English translation opts for \"to make excellent Telescopes,\" employing the more common and straightforward verb \"make.\" This represents a simplification in vocabulary choice."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P074: Si ce n'estoit, dit la Marquise, qu'il n'est point trop agreable de sçavoir qu'on ne nous peut découvrir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">de dedans Jupiter</span></span> qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche, je me representerois avec plaisir ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">comme les nostres le sont vers luy</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">&amp; cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considerent &amp; demandent l'une de l'autre</span></span>, Quel monde est-ce-là?

The English translation \"to behold him\" makes the purpose of this direction explicit (i.e., to observe or see him). This explicitation simplifies the text for the reader by reducing the inferential load and making the meaning more immediately accessible.","The original French uses a relative clause structure (\"avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considerent & demandent\" – with which the Planets consider each other and ask). The English translation changes this to a construction using participial phrases (\"of the two Planets in considering... and asking\"). This shift simplifies the sentence structure by replacing a more formal subordinate clause with a more fluid participial construction common in English, potentially enhancing readability. Additionally, the French \"les Planetes ... l'une de l'autre\" (the Planets ... one of the other) is made more explicit in the English pre-modification \"the two Planets\", slightly reducing ambiguity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P075: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Cela ne va pas si viste que vous pensez, repliquay-je.</span></span> Quand on verroit nostre Terre de dedans Jupiter, quand on l'y connoistroit, nostre Terre ce n'est pas nous; on n'a pas le moindre soupçon qu'elle puisse estre habitée.

It also changes the object of the verb \"connoissent\" (know) from \"la centiéme partie des autres Peuples\" (the hundredth part of the other Peoples [on their own world]) to \"the hundredth part of it\" (referring to their world itself).

This reduces the descriptive detail slightly, making the statement more concise and arguably simpler by removing a degree of emphasis.","The translation simplifies the original by omitting \"apparemment\" (apparently), which removes a nuance of speculation and makes the assertion more direct. It also omits \"mesmes\" (very/even), which was used for emphasis with \"leurs jours\" (their days). These omissions reduce the complexity and qualification of the original statement.","The French \"encore plus éloigné\" (even further/still further) includes the nuance of \"encore\" (still/even), emphasizing a progression or additional degree of distance. The English \"father remov'd\" (farther removed) is a direct comparative but omits this subtle emphasis provided by \"encore\", simplifying the comparative idea slightly.","The French \"On ne peut pas vous le dissimuler\" translates to \"One cannot hide it from you\" or \"It cannot be concealed from you.\" The English \"It cannot be deny'd\" simplifies the concept. While both express an admission, \"dissimuler\" implies a potential prior or active act of hiding or dissembling, a more complex notion than simply being \"denied.\" The translation opts for a more common and straightforward term.","The French \"& il faut qu'il ait... des ressources\" (and it is necessary that he has... resources) is translated with \"and therefore he must have... some other refuge.\" The addition of \"therefore\" makes the logical connection (causality from having no moon) more explicit than the simple conjunction \"&\" (and) in French. This explicitation guides the reader's understanding more directly, simplifying the inferential step.","The French text uses two distinct reflexive verbs, \"s'en imbibent\" (are imbued with it / soak it up) and \"s'en penetrent\" (are penetrated by it), to describe how the phosphorescent materials absorb light, emphasizing a thorough saturation. The English translation simplifies this by using only the verb \"imbibe it,\" omitting the concept of penetration (\"s'en penetrent\"). This reduces the descriptive richness and density of the original phrase.","The French \"fort élevéz\" means \"very high\" or \"very elevated.\" The English translation \"high rais'd\" omits the intensifier \"fort\" (very). This lessens the emphasis on the height of the rocks, simplifying the description by removing a degree of intensity.","The French \"Vous ne sçauriez nier que ce ne fust...\" employs the conditional \"sçauriez nier\" (you could not deny) and the subjunctive \"fust\" with an expletive \"ne,\" creating a grammatically complex and formal polite construction. The English \"You cannot deny that it would be...\" simplifies this to a more direct indicative mood (\"cannot deny\") and a standard conditional (\"would be\"), reducing the grammatical intricacy of the original.","The French \"s'alumer de toutes parts\" (lighting up on all sides/from all parts) provides a vivid detail about the pervasiveness of the illumination. The English \"lighted\" omits \"de toutes parts,\" simplifying the visual by removing this spatial detail. Additionally, \"dés que le Soleil seroit couché\" (as soon as the Sun would be/were set), which conveys a conditional or habitual aspect about the timing, is condensed to the simpler, more general \"at Sunset.\"","The French word \"tenebres\" is a somewhat more literary and intense term for \"darkness\" or \"gloom.\" The English translation uses \"in the dark,\" which is a more common and less stylistically marked term, representing a simplification of vocabulary.","The French \"qu'on s'en peut servir pour lire\" (that one can make use of them to read) is a more general statement about their utility. The English \"that they give light enough to read by\" simplifies by making the mechanism of their usefulness explicit (\"they give light enough\"). This explicitation reduces the inferential step for the reader.","The French phrase \"dés que la nuit est venuë\" (literally, \"as soon as the night has come\") is slightly more narrative and descriptive of the moment night begins. The English \"at nightfall\" is more concise and idiomatic, simplifying the temporal expression into a single, common noun phrase.","The French \"se dispersent de tous costéz\" (disperse themselves on all sides / in all directions) offers a slightly more specific and dynamic image of dispersal. The English \"disperse themselves every where\" is more general and arguably less vivid, a subtle simplification by reducing the specificity of the spatial description.","The French \"& vont répandre un nouveau jour?\" (literally, \"and go to spread/diffuse a new day?\") uses the verb \"répandre\" (to spread, diffuse) in a somewhat figurative sense. The English \"and create a new day?\" simplifies this by using the more direct and less metaphorical verb \"create,\" making the intended meaning more straightforward."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oyseaux.</span></span> Cela ne laisseroit pas d'estre joly, mais puis que la Nature a donné tant de Lunes à Saturne &amp; à Jupiter, c'est une marque qu'il faut des Lunes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">J'eusse esté bien-aise que tous les Mondes éloignez du Soleil en eussent eu, si Mars ne nous fust point venu faire une exception desagreable.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Ah! vrayment, repliquay-je, si vous vous mêliez de Philosophie plus que vous ne faites, il faudroit bien que vous vous accoûtumassiez à voir des exceptions dans les meilleurs Sistêmes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Il y a toûjours quelque chose qui y convient le plus juste du monde, &amp; puis quelque chose aussi qu'on y fait convenir comme on peut, ou qu'on laisse-là, si on desespere d'en pouvoir venir à bout.</span></span> Usons-en de mesme pour Mars, puis qu'il ne nous est point favorable, &amp; ne parlons point de luy. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Nous serions bien étonnez, si nous estions dans Saturne, de voir sur nos testes pendant la nuit ce grand Anneau qui iroit en forme de demy Cercle d'un bout à l'autre de l'Horison, &amp; qui nous renvoyant la lumiere du Soleil feroit l'effet d'une Lune continuë.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Et ne mettrons-nous point d'Habitans dans ce grand Anneau, interrompit-elle en riant?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Quoy que je sois d'humeur, répondis-je, à en envoyer par tout assez hardiment, je vous avoüe que je n'oserois en mettre là, cet Anneau me paroist une habitation trop irreguliere.</span></span> Pour les cinq petites Lunes, on ne peut pas se dispenser de les peupler. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Si cependant l'Anneau n'estoit, comme quelques-uns le soupçonnent, qu'un Cercle de Lunes qui se suivissent de fort prés, &amp; eussent un mouvement égal, &amp; que les cinq petites Lunes fussent trois échapées de ce grand Cercle, que de Mondes dans le Tourbillon de Saturne!</span></span> Quoy qu'il en soit, avec le secours même de l'Anneau, les Gens de Saturne sont assez miserables. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Il leur donne de la lumiere, mais quelle lumiere, dans l'éloignement où il est du Soleil!</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">Le Soleil même n'est pour eux qu'une petite Etoile blanche &amp; pâle, qui n'a qu'un éclat &amp; une chaleur bien foible, &amp; si vous les mettiez dans nos Pays les plus froids, dans la Groënlande, ou dans la Laponie, vous les verriez suër à grosses gouttes &amp; expirer de chaud.</span></span> </p><p>P080: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">Vous me donnez une idée de Saturne qui me gele, dit la Marquise, au lieu que tantost vous m'échauffiez en me parlant de Mercure.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Il faut bien, repliquay-je, que les deux Mondes qui sont aux extremitez de ce grand Tourbillon, soient opposées en toutes choses.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P074: I am not satisfy'd, says she, neither with your Rocks nor your Birds; not but that it may be very pretty; but since Nature has given so many Moons to Saturn and Iupiter, 'tis a sign there is occasion for them.

The translation simplifies this by altering the grammatical structure: the condition concerning Mars is transformed into an assertive main clause (\"but Mars I find makes...\"), thereby reducing the complexity and the nuanced counterfactual meaning of the original.","The reporting verb \"repliquay-je\" (I replied, passé simple) is simplified to \"says I.\" Additionally, the complex French modal construction \"il faudroit bien que vous vous accoûtumassiez\" (it would indeed be necessary that you accustom yourself), which uses an impersonal verb plus subjunctive, is simplified to the more direct English modal construction \"you would accustom your self,\" removing the impersonal structure and the explicit emphasis of \"bien.\"","The French idiomatic intensifier \"le plus juste du monde\" (literally \"the most just/fittingly of the world,\" meaning perfectly well or as suitably as possible) is simplified to the more common and less expressive English phrase \"very well,\" reducing the original's stylistic richness and specificity.","The French clause describing the ring's function, \"qui nous renvoyant la lumiere du Soleil feroit l'effet d'une Lune continuë\" (which, by reflecting sunlight to us, would produce the effect of a continuous moon), uses a participial phrase and a conditional verb (\"feroit\"). The translation simplifies this complex subordinate structure into two coordinated main verbs in the present indicative: \"reflects... and performs...\". This change makes the description more direct and factual, simplifying the grammatical structure and reducing the hypothetical nuance conveyed by the French conditional.","The French reporting verb \"interrompit-elle\" (she interrupted, in the passé simple tense) is translated as \"says the Marchioness.\" This simplifies the original by using a more common verb in a dialogue context (\"says\") and shifting to the present tense for the reporting verb, making the interruption feel more immediate and simplifying the narrative tense.","The reporting verb \"répondis-je\" (I replied, passé simple) is simplified to \"said I.\" More significantly, the French conditional \"je n'oserois\" (I would not dare) is translated as the present indicative \"I dare not.\" This shift simplifies the modality, making the philosopher's hesitation more direct and less nuanced than the hypothetical sense conveyed by the conditional mood.","The French text uses imperfect subjunctive verbs (\"se suivissent,\" \"eussent\") to describe the hypothetical characteristics of the moons within the conditional clause. The English translation simplifies this by using the present indicative verb \"follow\" (implying \"have\" for the equal motion), which is a less modally marked and structurally simpler way to convey these characteristics within the hypothesis, making the description more straightforward.","The French \"quelle lumiere!\" is an exclamatory phrase conveying the speaker's reaction to the (poor) quality of light. The English translation \"what sort of a light\" changes this into an explicit question by adding \"sort of\" and using an interrogative structure. This makes the implied comment on the light's quality more direct and less reliant on intonation or context for interpretation, a form of simplification through explicitation.","The vivid French idiom \"suër à grosses gouttes\" (to sweat in big drops / to sweat profusely) is replaced by the English word \"melt.\" \"Melt\" is a simpler, more common word and presents a more extreme, perhaps sensationalized image, but it loses the specific physiological detail of profuse sweating conveyed by the original French, thus simplifying the vocabulary and the imagery.","The French reporting phrase \"dit la Marquise\" (said the Marquise, using the passé simple) is translated as \"says the Marchioness.\" This simplifies the original by using a more common verb (\"says\") and shifting to the present tense for the reporting verb, making the dialogue more immediate and less formal than the French literary tense.","The French reporting verb \"repliquay-je\" (I replied, in the passé simple tense) is translated as \"says I.\" This simplifies the original by using a more common, conversational reporting tag and changing the tense from the literary passé simple to a form (\"says\") often used for vividness or immediacy in English dialogue, even when referring to past actions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P081: Ainsi, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">on est bien sage dans Saturne</span></span>, car vous m'avez dit que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">tout le monde estoit fou dans Mercure</span></span>.

Vocabulary: The French \"bizarre\" (strange, eccentric) in \"un assemblage si bizarre\" is translated to \"odd\" in \"so odd a kind of likeness;\" \"odd\" is a more common and generally milder adjective. 2. Structure and verb form: The French clause \"que nous serions ramassez\" (that we would be/were gathered/collected – a conditional passive idea) is simplified.

First, the French phrase 'bien d'autres sujets de reconnoissance' (many other/quite other reasons for gratitude), which is somewhat formal, is rendered as the more periphrastic 'these are things to be acknowledg'd as advantages.' This makes the concept more explicit by using a string of generally more common lexical items instead of a more compact and potentially higher-register noun phrase.

The translation \"if I propose lively pleasures to you\" simplifies this structure by: (a) changing the impersonal \"on\" to the direct personal pronoun \"I\"; (b) replacing the grammatically complex imperfect subjunctive \"proposoit\" with the more common and direct present indicative \"propose.\" This makes the condition less formal and structurally simpler.","The French conditional verb \"vous vous souviendriez\" (you would remember) indicates a hypothetical outcome, consistent with the conditional nature of the preceding clause in the original. The translation simplifies this to the future indicative \"you will remember.\" This change makes the statement more direct and less nuanced, reducing the grammatical complexity by removing the conditional mood.","The French phrase \"& que vous vous borneriez à nous?\" (and that you would limit/confine yourself to us?) uses the conditional reflexive verb \"se borner à\" (to limit oneself to, to be content with). The translation \"and will be of our side.\" simplifies this by: (a) replacing the specific and somewhat formal phrasal verb \"se borner à\" with the more common, general, and idiomatic English phrase \"be of our side\"; (b) shifting from the conditional mood (\"borneriez\") to the future indicative (\"will be\"). This simplifies the vocabulary, reduces the stylistic complexity, and alters the specific meaning towards a more general notion of allegiance, also softening the interrogative force of the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: CINQUIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P078: THE Fifth Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P078: THE Fifth Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P086:.

The English translation \"if you would\" is a much simpler and less forceful expression, reducing both the vocabulary and the original's emphasis on genuine interest or strong desire.","The French modal construction \"ne sçauroient estre\" (literally \"would not know how to be,\" idiomatically meaning \"could hardly be\" or expressing strong improbability with a degree of attenuation) is simplified to the more direct and assertive \"cannot be.\" This translation removes the subtle modality and politeness of the original French, opting for a more straightforward negation.","The French conditional tense \"mettroit\" (would put), indicating a hypothetical action on the part of the astronomer, is translated as the future indicative \"he'l put\" (he will put). This change simplifies the grammatical mood, presenting the astronomer's potential action as a more certain or direct future event rather than a purely hypothetical one, thus simplifying the original's more nuanced conditional statement.","The French \"il faudroit qu'elles la receussent\" (it would be necessary that they receive it) employs an impersonal construction (\"il faudroit que\") followed by a verb in the imperfect subjunctive (\"receussent\"). The English translation \"they must needs receive it\" simplifies this by using a direct, personal construction with a strong modal verb phrase (\"must needs receive\"). This avoids the more complex impersonal form and the subjunctive mood, making the sentence more straightforward and easier to parse.","The French uses the conditional mood in \"qui l'affoibliroit encore beaucoup\" (which would weaken it much more), indicating a hypothetical consequence of reflection. The English translation \"that must yet much more impair the strength of it\" uses the modal verb \"must,\" which expresses a stronger sense of necessity or certainty regarding the weakening effect. This simplifies the nuance from a potential or hypothetical weakening to a more definite or expected one.","The French phrase \"une lumiere qui auroit essuyé une reflexion\" (a light which would have undergone/suffered a reflection) uses the conditional perfect tense (\"auroit essuyé\") to describe a light that has hypothetically passed through the event of reflection. The English translation \"a Light that is made by Reflection\" uses the simple present passive voice. This significantly simplifies the verb phrase and the concept, changing it from a dynamic, hypothetical past action experienced by the light to a static characteristic or origin of the light.","The French phrase \"& fait deux fois cinquante millions de lieuës\" (and [would have] made/travelled twice fifty million leagues) implies a conditional perfect tense (\"auroit fait\"), as it's part of a larger hypothetical scenario about the light's journey. The English translation \"and has travail'd twice fifty millions of Leagues\" uses the present perfect tense. This simplifies the verb phrase by removing the hypothetical past layer, presenting the travel as a completed action with relevance to the present argument, rather than as part of a purely hypothetical past event.","The French \"eust cette force et cette vivacité\" (had that force and that vivacity) uses the imperfect subjunctive \"eust,\" a literary verb form expressing a hypothetical outcome within a complex conditional sentence. The English translation \"should retain that force and vivacity\" employs a modal verb (\"should\"). This is a more common and structurally simpler way to convey this hypothetical or expected quality in English, thus simplifying the verb form and avoiding the less common literary subjunctive.","The French \"Les voila donc lumineuses par elles-mêmes\" (So there they are then / Behold them then, luminous by themselves) is an idiomatic, somewhat impersonal, presentational phrase used to introduce an observation or conclusion. The English translation \"You see then they are all luminous in themselves\" personalizes the statement by directly addressing the interlocutor (\"You\"). This shift from a more detached presentational form to a direct address simplifies the rhetorical stance, making the conclusion more conversational and directly engaging."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P087: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Ne me trompay-je point, s'écria la Marquise, ou si je vois où vous me voulez mener?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">M'allez-vous dire:</span></span> Les Etoiles Fixes sont autant de Soleils, nostre Soleil est le centre d'un Tourbillon qui tourne autour de luy, pourquoy chaque Etoile Fixe ne sera-t-elle pas aussi le centre d'un Tourbillon qui aura un mouvement autour d'elle?

The English translation \"These new Lights I intend shall apologize for me\" simplifies this into the more straightforward concept of making an excuse, losing the playful complexity of laziness actively finding justification or advantage in enlightenment and thus reducing stylistic richness.","The French phrase \"tirer d'utilité\" (to draw utility/usefulness from) is rendered as \"make no profit by.\" While \"profit\" can mean general advantage, it is a very common word in English and can carry more concrete, sometimes material, connotations compared to the broader, more abstract concept of \"utilité.\" This substitution simplifies the idea by opting for a more common term that potentially narrows the scope of the benefit being discussed, moving from general usefulness to a more direct gain.","The French sentence uses a conditional structure \"Asseurément, si on..., c'est que l'on...\" (Assuredly, if one..., it is because one...). The English translation simplifies this into a more direct assertion: \"Certainly men..., only because they...\". This change flattens the hypothetical nature of the original observation into a declarative statement.

The English translation \"are like those of Love;\" simplifies this to a more general comparison, reducing the depth of the original analogy about how these reasonings are constituted.","The original French sentence employs a complex subordinate clause structure: \"Vous ne sçauriez accorder... que... il ne faille...\" (You could not grant... without it then being necessary that...). The English translation simplifies this significantly by recasting it as a more direct imperative (\"grant...\") followed by its consequence (\"and you are...\"), which simplifies the sentence structure for easier readability.","The French phrase \"& puis encore davantage,\" (and then still more/even more) clearly emphasizes an escalation or an increasing amount/degree of the concession. The English translation \"and then another,\" simplifies this by merely indicating succession, thereby losing the original's explicit emphasis on the growing magnitude.","Similar to the previous instance, the French \"& de cette consequence encore une autre,\" (and from this consequence yet another one/another one again) suggests a persistent, iterative continuation of consequences. The English \"and from that another,\" is a simpler and less emphatic term, reducing the sense of an ongoing, compounding chain.","The French phrase \"en tout ce qui me paroist,\" (literally \"in all that which appears to me,\") is simplified in the English translation. The word \"tout\" (all) is omitted, and the relative construction \"ce qui\" (that which) is rendered by the more concise \"what,\" which reduces lexical density and formality.","The French phrase \"en ce qui ne me paroist point,\" (literally \"in that which does not appear to me at all,\") is simplified.

The English translation \"you must e'en go on.\" is a significant simplification, replacing the original's vivid imagery of taking a decisive step (\"franchir le pas\") and the specified graceful manner (\"de bonne grace\") with the far more generic and blunt instruction \"go on.\" This reduces stylistic complexity and nuance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P091: Cela est hors de doute, répondis-je.

The translation simplifies this by consistently using the simple past tense ('began', 'did not foresee', 'fail'd'), creating a more linear narrative and reducing temporal complexity for easier comprehension.","The French 'il faut necessairement qu'elles entrent' is an impersonal construction ('it is necessary that they enter') which typically governs a subjunctive clause. The English translation 'they of necessity incroach' simplifies this syntactic structure by transforming it into a direct active voice construction with 'they' as the subject. This change makes the sentence more direct and less structurally complex.","The French 'Qu'ils ne s'inquiètent plus' (Let them no longer worry) uses a standard verb in a subjunctive form to express a wish or indirect command.

How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</p> <p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</p> <p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature. Has not she the secret of causing Herbs and Plants to spring and dye in a continual Revolution? I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it.</p> <p>P111: In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that I have e'en left them.</p> <p>P112: Let us leave them more yet, said I, if you'l be persuaded by me, and talk no more of them; for you are now come to the highest Roof of Heaven, and to tell you whether there be Stars beyond that or not, will require more knowledge than I have. Place Worlds there, or place them not, 'twill depend upon your self. The Empire of Philosophers is properly in those great invisible Country's, which may be or not be, according as they please, and be such as they please to make them.

The English 'though in all this time' simplifies this temporal connection and slightly streamlines the clause structure.","The French text presents a continuous sentence where the point about 'des demi Soleils' is a somewhat abrupt continuation. The English translation breaks this into two sentences, simplifying the logical flow and making the argument clearer.","The French phrase 'pour ne reparoistre de longtemps' (to not reappear for a long time) is condensed to 'for a long time', simplifying the negative construction and making it more direct.","The French 'cesser d'estre visibles à nos yeux' (to cease being visible to our eyes) is simplified to 'not to be visible to our eyes', using a more common and structurally simpler verb phrase.","The French subjunctive 'Que ce soient...'

This simplifies the interrogative nuance and the philosophical uncertainty into a more direct assertion.","The French relative construction 'dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte' (of which none of its parts is entirely exempt) is simplified to 'and no part of it wholly exempt,' using a coordinate clause which is structurally simpler.","The French descriptive phrase 'étoient de nature à ne changer jamais' (were of a nature to never change) is simplified to the single adjective 'were unchangeable,' a clear lexical simplification.","The French phrase 'Avoyent-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'experience?'

The English 'So, says she,' simplifies this by using a milder interjection and a more common, less expressive reporting verb, reducing emotional intensity and using more common vocabulary.","The French 'sçavante' (learned, scholarly) is a potent term for intellectual attainment. The English 'a knowing Woman.' uses the more common and general adjective 'knowing', simplifying the original term and slightly reducing its specific intellectual weight. The change from an exclamation mark to a period also lessens the expressed intensity.","The French 'vous l'estes assez raisonnablement' (referring to 'sçavante') means 'you are it [learned] to a reasonable degree.' The English 'you are reasonable enough' simplifies this by altering the affirmed quality from 'reasonably learned' to generally 'sensible,' thus simplifying the philosopher's nuanced agreement with the Marquise's intellectual claim.","The French idiom 'dés que l'envie vous en prendra.' (as soon as the whim/fancy takes you.) has a specific nuance of spontaneity and literary elegance. The English 'till you please your self.' simplifies this to a more common and general expression of personal choice, losing some of the original's stylistic particularity and specific nuance of 'l'envie' (whim/fancy)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">FIN</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P115: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P115: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">FINIS.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The French word 'FIN' (End) is replaced by the Latin term 'FINIS.' (End), which was a standard convention for marking the end of books in English publishing during that period. This substitution enhances immediate readability for an English audience potentially unfamiliar with the French word, by using a term that, although Latin, was a common and understood marker in their own literary context. This can be seen as a simplification as it makes the text more accessible by removing a potentially opaque foreign element for some readers and replacing it with a familiar convention."]}],"counts":{"manual":1,"ai":662}}
