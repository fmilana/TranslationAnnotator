This effectively reduces the original, informative title to just its initial part, 'PREMIER SOIR.', translated as 'THE First Night.'. This omission substantially shortens the title and reduces its informational density, which is a form of language simplification. While making the title more concise, it removes the explicit signposting of the chapter's scientific content, a characteristic of Fontenelle's popularizing style. The provided target text also includes editorial metadata 'A - Tagged Aphra Behn (1688)' which is not part of Fontenelle's original work or its direct translation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P002: Nous allâmes donc un Soir aprés Soupé, nous promener dans le Parc. Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes?</span></span> me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy?

Vous m'avez mis sur <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">ma folie</span></span>, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée. Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle. Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">C'est une idée qui me réjoüit</span></span>, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.</span></span> Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">vostre folie est si réjoüissante</span></span>, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir.

Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day? I confess, said she, the Day must yield to such a Night; the day which resembles a fair Beauty, which though more sparkling, is not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night. You are very generous, Madam, said I, to give the advantage to the brown, you who are so admirably fair your self: Yet without dispute, day is the most beautiful thing in Nature; and most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair.

I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that? The silence and gloom of the Night, said I, inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing. Besides, the Scene of the Universe by day-light appears too Uniform, we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts.

This simplifies the fuller interrogative sentence structure into a shorter, more immediate expression of her surprise and inquiry.","The French \"ma folie\" (my madness/folly), which can carry strong connotations, is translated to the milder and more common English word \"my weakness.\" This softens the original's intensity and uses a more generally accessible term.","The French clause \"C'est une idée qui me réjoüit\" (It's an idea that gladdens me/makes me rejoice) is translated as \"gives me very diverting Idea's.\" The word \"diverting\" (amusing) is less intense and perhaps more common for describing intellectual pleasure than a direct equivalent of \"réjoüit,\" simplifying the emotional register.","The complex French sentence \"Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire,\" which expresses a positive idea through a double negative (literally, 'According to me, there are not even Truths for which pleasantness is not necessary'), is simplified into the direct affirmative statement \"'tis necessary that even solid Truth should have it's agreeableness.\" This makes the meaning more immediately accessible by simplifying the rhetorical structure.","The French phrase \"vostre folie est si réjoüissante\" (your folly is so gladdening/joyous) is translated as \"your Folly is so pleasing to you.\" The adjective \"pleasing\" is more common and less emotionally charged than \"réjoüissante,\" thereby simplifying the vocabulary and toning down the intensity of the description.","The French phrase \"qui ne fait rire que l'esprit\" (which only makes the mind/intellect laugh) employs a distinctive and somewhat whimsical metaphor. The English translation \"which only transports the Mind\" replaces this with a more conventional expression for intellectual delight, simplifying the original's specific figurative language into a more standard phrase.","The French compliment \"à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse\" (to the most amiable/likeable person I know) is nuanced.

The somewhat complex interrogative structure 'vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles' (you would see well if it is Worlds that the Stars are) is simplified to the more direct assertion 'you could as easily discern there were Worlds in the Stars,' simplifying the sentence structure.","The French 'Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyait bien' (literally, 'Still if what one sees, one saw it well') has a slightly complex initial conjunction and repetition; it's simplified to the more direct conditional 'for if we could see well and truly what we see.' The consequence 'ce serait toujours autant de connu' (it would always be that much known), which is somewhat abstract, is simplified to the more concrete and common expression 'we should know enough.'","The somewhat formal French negative inverted construction 'ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner' (you hardly bother yourself to guess) is rendered as the more common and less formal declarative 'nor do we trouble our selves so much to find out.' The concise 'comment tout cela joue' (how all that works/plays) is expanded to the more explicit 'how all those Motions that we see there, are performed,' which uses common vocabulary ('performed,' 'motions') to clarify the abstract 'joue,' simplifying by using more common phrasing and explicitation.","The French verb 'enlève' (lifts/raises) is translated to the more common English phrasal verb 'carries up,' simplifying the vocabulary.","The French idiomatic phrase 'il n'est point à son aise' (he is not at all at his ease/comfortable) is simplified to the more direct and common adjective 'is uneasie.'","The French 'rêveries' (daydreams, wild speculations) is translated to the more general and perhaps more common term 'Notions.' The somewhat indirect phrase 'perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité' (literally 'lost reputation for all Antiquity,' meaning discredited Antiquity) is simplified into the more direct and common English idiom 'ruined the Reputation of the Ancients.'","The French includes the qualifying phrase 'en quelque facon' (in some way/manner) before 'tiré par des cordes' (pulled by ropes). The English translation omits this qualifier, rendering it simply as 'or drawn by Ropes.' This simplifies the statement by removing a nuanced hedge, making it more direct and reducing text density.","The French idiomatic expression 'A ce compte' (literally 'by this count,' meaning 'in that case' or 'by that reckoning') is translated as 'By what you say.' This English phrasing is more explicit about the basis of the Marquise's conclusion, directly linking it to the philosopher's preceding statements, thereby simplifying the logical connection for the reader by using more common, less idiomatic phrasing.","The French 'ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne méritoit?' (literally, 'have you not at all done it more honor than it deserved?') uses the somewhat abstract 'fait plus d'honneur.' The translation 'honoured it with a better opinion than it deserved' makes the meaning more concrete and accessible by specifying the nature of the 'honor' as 'a better opinion,' using more common vocabulary to articulate the concept of overestimation.","The French 'je l'en estime beaucoup plus' (I esteem it much more) is translated as 'I esteem it more.' The omission of the adverb of degree 'beaucoup' (much) reduces the expressed intensity, simplifying the statement by making it less emphatic and reducing its density.","The French 'une chose est deshonorée auprès d'eux' (a thing is dishonored in their view) uses a passive construction and the verb 'déshonorer' in a somewhat abstract sense. The English 'those sort of People never despise any thing' uses the active voice and the more common verb 'despise.' Furthermore, the passive 'dés qu'elle peut être conceüe' (as soon as it can be conceived/understood) is simplified to the more active and direct phrasing 'from the moment they begin to understand it.' These changes enhance readability by using more common vocabulary and simpler grammatical structures."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

Sur ce principe <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers,</span></span> tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne.

La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes.

Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter.</span></span> Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit.</span></span> Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là.</span></span> Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule.</span></span> Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin.</span></span> Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle.</span></span> Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit?</span></span> C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">&amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution.</span></span> Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je.</span></span> La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre?</span></span> Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre,</span></span> &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation. Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire.</span></span> Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche...</span></span> Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi.</span></span> Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil,</span></span> je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient,</span></span> en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy. </p><p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il?</span></span> Avez-vous remarqué, lui répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? Elle va vers le but où elle est envoyée, &amp; en même temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-même, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"25\">en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut.</span></span> La Terre fait la même chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures. Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le côté où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse. Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"26\">Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination?</span></span> Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la même cause. Les Planètes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nôtre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planètes marchent aussi; cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard, &amp; nous fait paroître dans leur cours des bizarreries <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"27\">dont il n'est pas nécessaire que je vous parle.</span></span> Il suffit que vous sachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irrégulier dans les Planètes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont notre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fond elles sont toutes très-reglées. Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, on ne l'a guere ménagée, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité.. Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures. </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'un gros Navire monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises? Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"28\">Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fût cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matière céleste, &amp; ne pas s'y laisser emporter?</span></span> C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\">good quality</span></span> alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\">System</span></span>, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</p> <p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\">World</span></span>, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\">discover Irregularities in their Revolutions</span></span>, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean:</span></span> So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">be pleased to observe,</span></span> that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe,</span></span> whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">it would frighten you:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it.</span></span> The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal:</span></span> in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese?</span></span> Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it.</span></span> But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular:</span></span> But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way:</span></span> Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful.</span></span> I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties. </p><p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way:</span></span> All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth.</span></span> Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next?</span></span> Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet.</span></span> Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again.</span></span> The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth.</span></span> I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam;</span></span> the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died.</span></span> Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together -</span></span> Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat.</span></span> You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">by looking in a streight Line,</span></span> I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">called to one of those with him,</span></span> and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass?</span></span> Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"25\">so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below:</span></span> 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting.

The emphatic \"le moins du monde\" (in the least bit) is reduced to the more standard \"any.\"","The French \"Cela le meriteroit bien\" (That would well deserve it / They would be right to do so) is translated using the more common and emphatic English idiom \"They wou'd have all the reason in the World to do so,\" simplifying by employing a familiar set phrase.","The concise French \"pour dormir en assurance\" (to sleep in safety/security) is expanded to \"to sleep in quiet, without fear of falling.\" This explicitation simplifies the abstract \"assurance\" by making the desired state (\"in quiet\") and the specific fear being alleviated (\"without fear of falling\") more concrete and easier to grasp.","The French verb \"retrancherons\" (from \"retrancher\" – to cut back, remove) within \"nous les retrancherons\" (we will remove them) is simplified to \"take them away.\" \"Take away\" is more common and simpler vocabulary than \"retrancher\" or its more direct English cognates.","In the French \"qu'ils me soient fort necessaires\" (that they be very necessary for me), the adverb \"fort\" (very) is omitted in the English translation \"they are needful.\" This reduces the intensity of the original expression, simplifying it by removing a qualifying adverb.","The French \"oser tourner\" (to dare to turn) is simplified to \"to turn round.\" The omission of \"oser\" (to dare) removes the nuance of bravery or overcoming hesitation, presenting the action more directly and simply.","The French \"Vous irez bien-tost encore plus loin\" (You will soon go even further) is rendered as the common English idiom \"a step further.\" This simplifies the original phrasing by replacing a more literal description of progression with a concise and conventional idiomatic expression.","The French \"toute cette variété infinie\" (all this infinite variety) is simplified by omitting the adjective \"infinie\" (infinite) in the English translation \"all the Variety.\" This reduces the descriptive richness and density of the original phrase.","The French construction \"tout cela mériteroit bien que l'on donnât vingt-quatre heures de son temps à le voir\" (all that would well deserve that one give twenty-four hours of one's time to see it) features a subjunctive and more elaborate phrasing. The English \"such a sight wou'd be very well worth twenty four Hours of ones Time\" uses a more direct and common idiomatic structure, simplifying the original sentence complexity.","The French \"il y passe continuellement d'autres Peuples qui prennent notre place\" (other Peoples continually pass there who take our place) is simplified. The subordinate clause \"qui prennent notre place\" (who take our place), which provides additional detail, is omitted in the English \"several other Nations must successively pass,\" reducing the density of information.","The French \"Je ne veux plus vous dire rien\" (I no longer want to say anything to you) is a general refusal to continue speaking. The English \"I will not argue with you\" simplifies this by specifying the type of verbal interaction being refused (argument), making the Marquise's stance more direct and aligned with common English expressions of disagreement.","The French \"une pirouette aussi legere\" (a spin so light/nimble, or a light/nimble spinning thing) can refer to the motion itself or an object defined by it. The English \"such a little Humming-Top\" replaces this with a common, concrete object (a child's toy), making the image more immediately accessible and less abstract. \"Little\" simplifies the multifaceted \"legere\" (light, agile) mainly to size."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.

While \"ne feront aucune façon de\" is an idiom, the key simplification lies in rendering \"accorder tout\" (grant everything) as \"granting any Favour.\" \"Any Favour\" is a more conventional and possibly euphemistic phrase in this context than the very general \"tout\" (everything), simplifying the expression towards more common phrasing for such topics.","The French future action \"qui iront voler des Femmes\" (who will go to steal women / who will steal women) is simplified to a present habitual state \"who live by stealing of Wives.\" This change simplifies the temporal aspect by describing a general characteristic rather than a specific future event and specifies \"Femmes\" (Women) to the more socially specific \"Wives.\"","The French phrase \"nous qui debiterons peut-être encore des rêveries\" (we who will perhaps again utter/retail daydreams/fancies) is significantly simplified to \"our selves again, perhaps talking as we do now.\" The stylistically marked verb \"débiter\" is reduced to the common verb \"talking,\" and the abstract noun \"rêveries\" is replaced by a colloquial phrase referring to their current, familiar activity, simplifying both vocabulary and the conceptual expression."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P015: Il est assez plaisant, dit la Marquise, d'imaginer ce que vous venez de me dire; mais si je voyois tout cela d'en haut, je voudrais avoir la liberté de hâter ou d'arrêter le mouvement de la Terre, selon que les objets me plairont plus ou moins, &amp; je vous assure que je ferais passer bien vite <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">ceux qui s'embarrassent de Politique</span></span>, ou qui mangent leurs Ennemis; mais il y en a d'autres pour qui j'aurois de la curiosité.

The English \"are the least perceptible\" uses a more direct copula + adjective structure, simplifying the syntax for easier readability.","The French \"cela s'appelle bâiller\" (literally \"that is called yawning\") is a concise, idiomatic, and impersonal expression suggesting that the philosopher's moralizing about physics is inappropriate or tiresome. The English translation replaces this figurative phrase with a concrete, personal observation (\"I perceive you are sleepy, and begin to yawn\"), making the meaning more direct and accessible by removing the idiomatic abstraction.","The French \"pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes\" (to exhaust the subject of Systems) uses the relatively formal verb \"épuiser\" (to exhaust). The English \"to make an end of what might be said to Systems\" uses the more common phrasal expression \"to make an end of\" and a slightly less dense phrasing, simplifying the vocabulary and making the expression more readily understandable.","The French \"ne pouvoit être propre tout au plus qu'à soûtenir\" (could at most only be suitable for supporting) is a grammatically complex and nuanced construction. The English phrasing in \"was only good to maintain\" simplifies this by using a more straightforward structure and more common vocabulary, reducing the original's density and intricacy within the larger translated clause.","The French uses the abstract noun \"l'Immobilité\" (immobility). The English translation \"the standing still\" employs a gerund phrase that is generally more common and less formal than the direct Latinate cognate \"immobility,\" thereby simplifying the vocabulary for broader accessibility.","The French \"plus riant\" (literally \"more smiling\" or \"more laughing\") is a metaphorical and evocative adjective suggesting attractiveness or cheerfulness in an intellectual context. The English \"more agreeable\" is a more common, less figurative, and more direct term to convey general pleasantness or suitability, simplifying the metaphorical richness of \"riant\" for easier comprehension."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">SECOND SOIR.

All these Arguments wou'd not prevail upon my Citizen; who wou'd continue still obstinate in maintaining, that St. Denis was not inhabited, because he saw none of the People. The Moon is our St. Denis, and we the Citizens of Paris, that never went out of our own Town. Ah, interrupted the Marquiese, you do us wrong; we are not so foolish as your Citizens of Paris: Since he sees that St. Denis is so like to Paris in every thing, he must have lost his Reason, if he did not think it was inhabited: But for the Moon, that's nothing like the Earth.

This simplifies the original's subtle irony into a more straightforward expression of relief.","The French \"d'entendre dire que\" (to hear it said that) implies a more passive reception of information. The English \"if I tell you\" makes the philosopher's role more active and the phrasing more direct, simplifying the indirectness of the original.","The French uses a descriptive doublet \"une folie & d'une vision\" (a madness and a delusion/vision). The English simplifies this to a single, more common, and general term \"a Fable,\" reducing the lexical richness and the specific negative connotations of the original.","The translation omits the latter part of the French explanation: \"& qu'on a des ménagemens avec ses Ennemis mêmes\" (and that one shows consideration/diplomacy even with one's Enemies). This omission simplifies the text by reducing the density of the argument and removing a nuance about strategic social conduct.","The French question \"s'il croit que Saint-Denis soit habité comme Paris\" includes the comparative \"comme Paris\" (like Paris), crucial for the analogy. The English translation \"if he believ'd St. Denis to be inhabited\" omits this comparison, simplifying the question by removing a key detail from the original proposition.","The French phrase \"pour ce qui est d'être habité\" (with regard to being inhabited) is a specific and somewhat formal construction. The English translation \"and be inhabited as well as it,\" particularly with the addition of \"in every thing else,\" makes the point more explicit using a more common and less abstract phrasing, thereby simplifying the original.","The French \"& chacun de nous est ce Bourgeois de Paris\" (and each of us is this Parisian Bourgeois) emphasizes individual identification with the character in the analogy. The English \"and we the Citizens of Paris\" generalizes this to a collective \"we,\" simplifying the nuance of individual connection to a broader group identity.","The French condition \"s'il faut que la Lune ressemble en tout à la Terre,\" (if it is necessary that the Moon resembles in everything the Earth,) uses an impersonal construction of necessity (\"il faut que\"). The English \"if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth,\" changes this to a personal action by the speaker, simplifying the abstract impersonal necessity into a more direct, agency-driven condition.","The French \"qu'il n'y aura pas moyen de s'en dispenser,\" (that there will be no way to dispense with it/to avoid it,) expresses an impersonal and somewhat formal consequence. The English \"if you do that, I must yield;\" simplifies this by making the condition explicit (\"if you do that\") and phrasing the consequence as a direct, personal action (\"I must yield\"), using a more common and less elaborate structure.","The French \"& il faut que la Terre renvoye aussi à la Lune la lumière du Soleil;\" (and it is necessary that the Earth also send back to the Moon the Sun's light;) uses a modal construction of necessity (\"il faut que\"). The English \"as the Earth, without doubt, reflects it back again to the Moon,\" changes this to an indicative assertion, presenting the phenomenon as a direct fact rather than a logical or physical requirement, thus simplifying the more nuanced expression of necessity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere du Soleil?

Au contraire, parce que la Terre a le malheur que nous la voyons de trop prés, elle ne nous paroît qu'une grosse masse, propre seulement à fournir de la pâture aux Animaux, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">&amp; nous ne nous apercevons pas qu'elle est lumineuse, faute de nous pouvoir mettre à quelque distance d'elle.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Cela va de la même maniere</span></span>, dit la Marquise, que quand nous sommes frapés de l'éclat des Conditions; élevées au-dessus des nôtres, &amp; que nous ne voyons pas, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">qu'au fond elles se ressemblent toutes extrêmement</span></span>. </p><p>P025: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">C'est la même chose</span></span>, répondis-je. Nous voulons juger de tout, &amp; nous sommes toûjours dans un mauvais point de veüe. Nous voulons juger de nous, nous en sommes trop près; nous voulons juger des autres, nous en sommes trop loin. Qui serait entre la Lune &amp; la Terre, ce seroit la vraye place pour les bien voir. Il faudroit être simplement spectateur du Monde, &amp; non pas Habitant. Je ne me consoleray jamais, dit-elle, de l'injustice que nous faisons à la Terre, &amp; de la préoccupation trop favorable où nous sommes pour la Lune, si vous ne m'assurez que les Gens de la Lune ne connaissent pas mieux leurs avantages que nous connoissons les nôtres, &amp; qu'ils prennent notre Terre pour un Astre, sans savoir que leur habitation en est un aussi. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Pour cela, repris-je, je vous le garantis.</span></span> Nous leur paraissons faire assez regulièrement nos fonctions d'Astres. Il est vray qu'ils ne nous voyent pas décrire un Cercle autour d'eux; mais il n'importe, voicy ce que c'est. La moitié de la Lune qui se trouva tournée vers nous au commencement du Monde, y a toûjours eté tournée depuis; elle ne nous présente jamais que ces yeux, cette bouche, &amp; le reste de ce visage que notre imagination luy compose sur le fondement des tâches qu'elle nous montre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Si l'autre moitié opposée se presentoit à nous, d'autres tâches differemment arrangées, nous feroient sans doute imaginer quelque autre figure.</span></span> Ce n'est pas que la Lune ne tourne sur elle-même, elle y tourne en autant de temps qu'autour de la Terre, c'est à dire, en un mois; mais lors qu'elle fait une partie de ce tremblement, &amp; de s'imaginer que nous avons dans le Ciel comme un mouvement de Pendule qui va &amp; vient. </p><p>P026: Toutes ces Planètes, dit la Marquise, sont faites comme nous, qui rejetons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mêmes. La Terre dit: Ce n'est pas moy qui tourne, c'est le Soleil. La Lune dit, _Ce n'est pas moy qui tremble, c'est la Terre. Il y a bien de l'erreur par tout. Je ne vous conseille pas d'entreprendre d'y rien réformer, répondis-je, il vaut mieux que vous acheviez de vous convaincre de l'entiere ressemblance de la Terre &amp; de la Lune. Représentez-vous ces deux grandes Boules suspendües dans les Cieux. Vous savez que le Soleil éclaire toûjours une moitié des Corps qui sont ronds, &amp; que l'autre moitié est dans l'ombre. Il y a donc toûjours une moitié, tant de la Terre que de la Lune, qui est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">éclairée du Soleil, c'est à dire, qui a le jour</span></span>, &amp; une autre moitié qui est dans la nuit. Remarquez d'ailleurs que comme une Balle a moins de force &amp; de vitesse après qu'elle a été donner contre une muraille qui l'a renvoyée d'un autre côté, de même la lumière s'affoiblit lors qu'elle a été réfléchie par quelque Corps. Cette lumière blanchâtre qui nous vient de la Lune, est la lumière même du Soleil, mais elle ne peut venir de la Lune à nous que par une réflexion. Elle a donc beaucoup perdu de la force &amp; de la vivacité qu'elle avoit lorsqu'elle étoit receüe directement sur la Lune, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">&amp; cette lumière éclatante que nous recevons du Soleil &amp; que la Terre reflechit sur la Lune, ne doit plus être qu'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée.</span></span> Ainsi ce qui nous paroit lumineux dans la Lune, &amp; qui nous éclaire pendant nos nuits, ce sont des parties de la Lune qui ont le jour; &amp; les parties de la Terre qui ont le jour lors qu'elles sont tournées vers les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit les éclairent aussi. Tout dépend de la manière dont la Lune &amp; la Terre se regardent. Dans les premiers jours du mois que l'on ne voit pas la Lune, c'est qu'elle est entre le Soleil &amp; nous, &amp; qu'elle marche de jour avec le Soleil. Il faut necessairement que toute sa moitié qui a le jour, soit tournée vers le Soleil, &amp; que toute sa moitié qui a la nuit, soit tournée vers nous. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">Nous n'avons garde de voir cette moitié qui n'a aucune lumière pour se faire voir.</span></span> Mais cette moitié de la Lune qui a la nuit, étant tournée vers la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, nous voit sans être veüe, &amp; nous voit sous la même figure que nous voyons la Pleine Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">C'est alors pour les Gens de la Lune Pleine Terre, s'il est permis de parler ainsi.</span></span> Ensuite la Lune qui avance sur son Cercle d'un mois, se dégage de dessous le Soleil, &amp; commence à tourner vers nous <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">un petit coin de sa moitié éclairée</span></span>, &amp; voilà le Croissant. Alors aussi les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit commencent à ne plus voir toute la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, &amp; nous sommes en Décours pour elles.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P019: But, said the Marquiese, is the Earth as proper for reflecting the Light of the Sun, as the Moon? You are always for the Moon, said I, and you cannot rid your self of those Remains of Kindness you have for her. Light is compos'd for little Balls, which rebound upon any solid Body, which is opaque, or obscure, and are sent back another way; whereas they pass through any thing that offers them an Opening, or Passage, in a streight Line; which is Diaphanus, or clear; such as Air and Glass: So that the Moon enlightens us, because she is an Opaque, solid Body, which retorts these little Balls upon us; and I believe you will not dispute the same Solidity to the Earth. Admire then, Madam, how advantageous it is, to be well posted; so that the Moon being at a great distance from us, we see it as an enlightned Body only, but are ignorant that 'tis a gross, solid Mass, very much like the Earth: On the other hand, the Earth having the ill luck to be seen by us too near, we consider it only as a great massy Body, fit only for the producing of Food for living Creatures. 'Tis just, said the Marquiese, as when we are struck and surpriz'd with the Splendour of Quality above our own; we do not perceive, that in the main, there's no difference between them and us. 'Tis just so, said I; and we will needs be judging of every thing; but we have the mis-fortune, still to be plac'd in a false Light: Wou'd we judge of our selves, we are too near; if of others, we are too far off: Cou'd one be plac'd between the Moon and the Earth, that wou'd be a true Station to consider both well: To this End, we ought only to be Spectators of the World, and not Inhabitants. I shall never be satisfy'd, said the Marquiese, with the Injury we do the Earth, in being too favourably engag'd for the Inhabitants of the Moon, unless you can assure me, that they are as ignorant of their Advantages, as we are of ours; and that they take our Earth for a Star, without knowing that the Globe they inhabit is one also. Be assur'd of that, Madam, said I, that the Earth appears to them to perform all the Functions of a Star: 'Tis true, they do not see the Earth describe a Circle round 'em, but that's all one; I'll explain to you what it is: That side of the Moon which was turn'd towards the Earth at the beginning of the World, has continu'd towards the Earth ever since; which still represents to us these same Eyes, Nose and Mouth, which our Imaginations fansie we see compos'd of these Spots, Lights and Shadows, which are the Surface of the Moon: Cou'd we see the other half of the Moon, 'tis possible our Fancy wou'd represent to us some other Figure. This does not argue, but the Moon turns however upon her own Axis, and takes as much time to perform that Revolution, as she does to go round the Earth in a Month. But then, when the Moon performs a part of her Revolutions on her own Axis, and that she ought to hide from us (for Example) one Cheek of this imaginary Face, and appear to us in another Position, she does at the same time perform as much of the Circle she describes in turning round the Earth; and tho' she is in a new Point of Sight or Opposition as to us, yet she represents to us still the same Cheek: So that the Moon, in regard to the Sun, and the other Planets, turns upon her own Axis; but does not so as to the Earth.</p> <p>P020: The Inhabitants of the Moon see all the other Planets rise and set in the space of fifteen Days, but they see our Earth always hanging in the same Point of the Heavens. This seeming Immovability does not very well agree with a Body that ought to pass for a Planet; but the truth is, the Earth is not in such perfection: Besides, the Moon has a certain trembling Quality, which does sometimes hide a little of her imaginary Face, and at other times shews a little of her opposite Side; and no doubt but the Inhabitants of the Moon attribute this shaking to the Earth, and believe we make a certain swinging in the Heavens, like the Pendulum of a Clock. All these Planets, said the Marquiese, are like us Mortals, who always cast our own Faults upon others: Says the Earth, It is not I that turn round, 'tis the Sun: Says the Moon, It is not I that tremble, 'tis the Earth: There are Errors and Mistakes every where. I wou'd not advise you, said I, to undertake to reform any of 'em; 'tis better that I make an end in convincing you, that the Moon is in all things like the Earth. Represent to your self these two great Globes, hanging in the Heavens; you know that the Sun does always enlighten one half of any Globe, and the other half is in the Shadow; there is therefore always one half of both Moon and Earth that is enlightned, or half Day, and the other half is still in the Darkness of Night. Be pleas'd, besides, to consider that a Ball has less force and swiftness after it re- bounds from a Wall, against which it was thrown, than it had before it touch'd the Wall, which sends it another way; so Light is not so strong, after 'tis reflected by any solid Body: This pale Light which comes to us from the Moon, is the Light of the Sun it self, but we have it only by Reflection from the Moon, and has lost a great deal of that Strength and Vivacity which it had when 'twas receiv'd by the Moon, directly from the Sun; and that bright and dazling Light which we receive from the Sun, must in the same manner appear to the Inhabitants of the Moon, after 'tis reflected by the Earth, on the Moon: So that the Surface of the Moon, which we see enlightned, and which shines upon us in the Night, is that half of the Moon that enjoys the Day, as that half of the Globe of the Earth which is enlightned by the Sun, when 'tis turn'd towards the darkened half of the Globe of the Moon, does give Light to the Inhabitants there, during their Nights. All depends upon the different Opposition and Aspects between the Moon and the Earth: The first and second Day of the Moon, we do not see her, because she is betwixt the Sun and us, and moves with the Sun by our Day; it necessarily follows, that the half of the Moon which is enlightned, is turn'd towards the Sun, and the obscure part towards the Earth; 'tis no wonder then, that we cannot see that half which is dark; but that same half of the Moon which is in Darkness, being turn'd towards the enlightned half of the Earth, the Inhabitants see us, without being seen, and the Earth appears to them, as their Full-Moon does to us; and so, if one may use the Expression, 'tis with them Full-Earth. After this, the Moon going on in her Monthly Circle, dis-engages her self from the Sun, and begins to turn towards us a part of her enlightned half, which is the Crescent; at the very same time, the darkned half of the Moon loses some share of the enlightned part of the Earth, and then the Earth is in the Wain, as to its Inhabitants.</p>","aiHtml":"<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\"></span></span><p>P019: But, said the Marquiese, is the Earth as proper for reflecting the Light of the Sun, as the Moon?

The phrase 'dont vous ne sauriez vous défaire' (of which you would not know how to rid yourself) is simplified to the more direct 'you cannot rid your self of.'","The original French specifies two qualities, 'cette même dureté e& cette même solidité' (this same hardness and this same solidity). The translation simplifies this by mentioning only 'the same Solidity,' omitting 'dureté' (hardness) and thus reducing the descriptive detail.","This entire clause, 'and we do not perceive that it is luminous, for want of being able to put ourselves at some distance from it,' which provides a reason for our perception of Earth, is omitted in the translation. This reduces the density of the text and simplifies the argument by removing a supporting detail.","The French phrase 'Cela va de la même maniere' (It goes the same way / It's the same thing) is condensed into the shorter and more common English expression ''Tis just.'","The nuanced French 'qu'au fond elles se ressemblent toutes extrêmement' (that at bottom they all resemble each other extremely) is simplified to the more absolute and less nuanced statement 'that in the main, there's no difference between them and us.'","The straightforward French 'C'est la même chose' (It's the same thing) is rendered by the slightly more colloquial and common English phrase ''Tis just so.'","The explicit and direct guarantee 'je vous le garantis' (I guarantee it to you) is omitted. Instead, the phrase is softened to the imperative 'Be assur'd of that,' simplifying by removing the strong performative assertion.","The descriptive clause 'd'autres tâches differemment arrangées' (other differently arranged spots) is omitted. Furthermore, the certainty conveyed by 'sans doute' (undoubtedly) is weakened to ''tis possible.' This simplification reduces descriptive detail and softens the assertion.","The French explanatory structure 'c'est à dire, qui a le jour' (that is to say, which has the day) is simplified by using 'or' and the concise term 'half Day' instead of the full descriptive clause.","The French text explicitly states the outcome for Earth-reflected light reaching the Moon: 'ne doit plus être qu'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée' (must no longer be but a whitish light when it has arrived there). The translation omits this specific outcome, stating it 'must in the same manner appear to the Inhabitants of the Moon,' simplifying by relying on implication rather than direct statement of the light's transformation.","The idiomatic French expression 'Nous n'avons garde de voir' (approximately, 'We are far from seeing' or 'There's no chance we see') is simplified to the more common and straightforward English phrase ''tis no wonder then, that we cannot see.'","The phrase 'C'est alors pour les Gens de la Lune Pleine Terre' (It is then for the People of the Moon Full Earth) is rendered more concisely as ''tis with them Full-Earth.' Additionally, the somewhat formal 's'il est permis de parler ainsi' (if it is permitted to speak thus) is replaced by the more common English idiom 'if one may use the Expression.'","The vivid and specific French 'un petit coin' (a little corner) is translated to the more general and common 'a part,' simplifying the imagery through generalization."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je saurai tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.</span></span> Je vois en gennral que dans la Lune ils ont un mois à rebours du nôtre, &amp; je gage que quand nous avons pleine Lune, c'est que toute la moitié lumineuse de la Lune est tournée vers toute la moitié obscure de la Terre; qu'alors ils ne nous voyent point du tout, &amp; qu'ils comtent Nouvelle Terre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Je ne voudrois pas qu'il me fût reproché de m'être fait expliquer tout au long une chose si aisée.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Mais les Eclipses, comment vont-elles?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Il ne tient qu'à vous de le deviner, répondis-je.</span></span> Quand la Lune est Nouvelle, qu'elle est entre le Soleil &amp; nous, &amp; que toute sa moitié obscure est tournée vers nous qui avons le jour, vous voyez bien que l'ombre de cette moitié obscure se jette vers nous. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Si la Lune est justement sous le Soleil, cette ombre nous le cache, &amp; en même temps noircit une partie de cette moitié lumineuse de la Terre qui etoit vûë par la moitié obscure de la Lune.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Voilà donc une Eclipse de Soleil pour nous pendant notre jour, &amp; une Eclipse de Terre pour la Lune pendant sa nuit.</span></span> Lors que la Lune est pleine, la Terre est entre elle &amp; le Soleil, &amp; toute la moitié obscure de la Terre est tournée vers toute la moitié lumineuse de la Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">L'ombre de la Terre se jette donc vers la Lune; si elle tombe sur le Corps de la Lune, elle noircit cette moitié lumineuse que nous voyons, &amp; à cette moitié lumineuse qui avoit le jour, elle luy dérobe le Soleil.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Voilà donc une Eclipse de Lune pour nous pendant notre nuit, &amp; une Eclipse de Soleil pour la Lune pendant le jour dont elle joüissait.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Ce qui fait qu'il n'arrive pas des Eclipses toutes les fois que la Lune est entre le Soleil &amp; la Terre, ou la Terre entre le Soleil &amp; la Lune, c'est que souvent ces trois Corps ne sont pas tres exactement rangez en ligne droite, &amp; que par consequent celuy qui devroit faire l'Eclipse, jette son ombre un peu à côté de celuy qui en devroit être couvert.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P021: Say no more, said the Marquiese, briskly, I shall know all the rest when I please; I need only think a little, and follow the Moon in her Monthly Circle: I see in general, that the Inhabitants of the Moon have their Month, the exact Reverse of ours; and I am perswaded, when 'tis Full-Moon, the enlightned half of it is turn'd towards the obscure part of the Earth, and then they do not see us, but a certain new Earth.

The translation uses an active voice (\"any Body reproach me\") and makes the implied reason for reproach explicit (\"with the want of so much Sence\"), reducing the inferential load and simplifying the sentence structure.","The idiomatic French question \"comment vont-elles?\" (literally \"how do they go?\", meaning \"how do they work?\") is simplified to a more direct and explicit question, \"What is the Cause of them?\". This focuses on the scientific explanation directly, simplifying the original's somewhat colloquial and general inquiry.","The French phrase \"Il ne tient qu'à vous de le deviner\" (It's up to you to guess it/figure it out) is a polite, somewhat indirect suggestion. The English translation, \"If you do not understand that, ... 'tis your own fault,\" drastically simplifies this by making the statement very direct and blunt, removing nuance, and changing \"deviner\" (to guess) to the simpler concept of \"understand\" in this context.","The French \"nous le cache\" (hides it from us, with 'le' referring to the Sun) is simplified by explicitating the pronoun: \"hides the Sun from us.\" The verb \"noircit\" (blackens) is translated to the more common and less intense \"darkens,\" a lexical simplification. Furthermore, \"qui etoit vûë par la moitié obscure de la Lune\" (which was seen by the obscure half of the Moon) is expanded to \"which was seen by the Inhabitants of the obscure half of the Moon,\" simplifying by making the agency of seeing explicit.","The common French concluding phrase \"Voilà donc\" (So there is / There you have it then) is simplified to the more direct English statement \"And this is.\" Additionally, the prepositional phrase \"pour la Lune\" (for the Moon) is clarified to \"to those in the Moon,\" explicitly referring to the inhabitants and thus simplifying the reference for the reader.","The French reflexive verb \"se jette\" (casts itself) is simplified to the English passive construction \"is cast.\" \"Corps de la Lune\" (Body of the Moon) is rendered as \"her Surface,\" a more specific and common term in this astronomical context. The verb \"noircit\" (blackens) is simplified to \"obscures\" (a more common term), and the stronger verb \"dérobe\" (steals/snatches away) is simplified to the more common \"hides.\" The reference of the indirect object pronoun \"luy\" is also made more explicit in the slightly expanded English phrasing.","The French concluding phrase \"Voilà donc\" is simplified to \"This is.\" The reference \"pour la Lune\" (for the Moon) is clarified to \"to them\" (the inhabitants).

This simplifies the original nuance by making the speaker's intent more explicit and conventionally conversational in English.","The plural and feminine 'des Magiciennes' (sorceresses/female magicians) is simplified to the singular and potentially generic/masculine 'the Magician.' This reduces the specificity of number and gender, making the reference more general.","The hyperbolic phrase 'Une infinité de Gens' (an infinity of people) is translated with the more common and less intense phrase 'a great many People,' simplifying the vocabulary by reducing its evocative power.","The original 'pour nous rassurer' (to reassure us) is expanded to 'to assure us, there was no danger.' This explicitation simplifies the text by directly stating the content of the reassurance, reducing the reader's inferential load.","The phrase 'Arrêt du Genre humain' (Decree of Mankind) is rephrased as 'a Law made by universal Consent,' making it more concrete. The dependent clause 'qui défendît qu'on parlât' is simplified to an infinitive phrase 'never to speak.' Furthermore, 'des sotises qui ont été faites ou dites sur ce Chapitre là' (the stupidities that were done or said on that topic) is condensed to 'such Folly,' omitting 'faites ou dites' (done or said) and the specific reference 'sur ce Chapitre là,' thereby streamlining the sentence and reducing detail.","The complex French conditional and subjunctive structure 'Il faudrait donc... que le même Arrêt abolît... & défendît...' (It would be necessary then... that the same Decree abolish... and forbid...) is simplified into a more direct proposal 'let there be another Law made, for abolishing...'. This significantly simplifies the sentence structure and modality. The specific action of 'défendît qu'on parlât jamais de rien' (forbid that one ever speak of anything) is subsumed under the broader 'abolishing the Memory'.","The French phrase 'Dites-moi, je vous prie, une chose' (Tell me, I pray you, one thing) is shortened to 'Pray, tell me.' The specific 'une chose' (one thing) is omitted, simplifying the request to its essential components.","The conditional 'paraîtroit' (would seem) is simplified to the present 'seems'. The specific groups 'les Indiens de ce pays-là,' 'les Amériquains,' 'les Grecs' are generalized to 'some of 'em,' 'others,' and 'some,' reducing specificity. Most significantly, the final clause '& qu'enfin nous leur rendissions la consternation qu'ils causent icy-bas' (and that finally we would return to them the consternation that they cause down here) is entirely omitted, simplifying the text by removing a complex idea and shortening the sentence considerably.","The introductory framing 'Je voudrais bien savoir pourquoy' (I would very much like to know why) is omitted, transforming the indirect question into a direct one ('Why...'). This simplifies the sentence structure. 'Messieurs de la Lune' (Gentlemen of the Moon) is changed to the more neutral 'the Inhabitants of the Moon,' and 'l'esprit plus fort' (stronger spirit/mind) is simplified to the more common 'more Sense.'","The parenthetical narrative detail 'ajoûtai-je en riant' (I added, laughing) is omitted. 'Un nombre prodigieux d'hommes' (a prodigious number of men) is simplified to 'many Inhabitants in our Globe,' using less intense vocabulary. The vivid concluding phrase '& que nous sommes à genoux les uns devant les autres' (and that we are on our knees one before the other) is entirely omitted, which simplifies the text by removing a significant illustrative detail and shortening the sentence.","The French 'donner des crises à ses Malades' (literally 'to give crises to its Sick ones'), implying an active influence or causation of critical turns in illnesses, is translated as 'to give a Judgment on their Distempers.' This shifts the meaning to a more passive act of assessment or prediction, simplifying the original implication of direct intervention to a more intellectual or observational role.","The phrase 'la seule sotte espèce de l'Univers' (the only foolish species in the Universe) is translated as 'the only Fools of the Universe.' This simplifies the vocabulary by replacing the slightly more formal/biological term 'espèce' (species) with the more common and direct word 'Fools,' thereby losing some of the original's specific nuance.","The somewhat periphrastic French construction 'L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à être generalement répanduë' (Ignorance is something quite apt/suited to be generally widespread) is simplified in its structure to the more direct English phrasing 'Ignorance is naturally a very general Talent.'

Il n'est pas possible, répliquay-je, que Messieurs de l'Observatoire vous en instruisent, il faut le demander à Astolphe, qui fut conduit dans la Lune par Saint Jean. Je vous parle d'une des plus agréables folies de l'Arioste, &amp; je seuir sûr que vous serez bien aise de la savoir. J'avoüe qu'il eut mieux fait de n'y pas mêler Saint Jean, dont le nom est si digne de respect; mais enfin c'est une licence Poëtique, qui peut seulement passer pour un peu trop gaye. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Tout le Poëme est dédié à un Cardinal, e&amp; un grand Pape l'a honoré d'une approbation éclatante que l'on voit au devant de quelques Editions.</span></span> Voicy de quoy il s'agit. Roland, Neveu de Charlemagne, étoit devenu fou, parce que la belle Angelique luy avoit préferé Médor. Un jour Astolphe, brave Paladin, se trouva dans le Paradis Terrestre, qui étoit sur la cime d'une Montagne très haute, où son <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Hippogriffe</span></span> l'avoit porté. Là il rencontre Saint Jean, qui luy dit que pour guerir la folie de Rolan, il étoit necessaire qu'ils fissent ensemble le Voyage de la Lune. Astolphe, qui ne demandoit qu'à voir du Pays, ne se fait point prier, &amp; aussi-tôt voilà un Chariot de feu qui enleve par les airs l'apôtre e&amp; le Paladin. Comme Astolphe n'étoit pas grand Philosophe, il fut fort surpris de voir la Lune beaucoup plus grande qu'elle ne luy avoit paru de dessus la Terre. Il fut bien plus surpris encore de voir d'autres fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts, &amp; ce qui m'aurait bien surpris aussi, des Nymphes qui chassoient dans ces Forêts. Mais ce qu'il vit de plus rare dans la Lune, c'étoit un Vallon où se trouvoit tout ce qui se perdoit sur la Terre, de quelque espèce qu'il fût, &amp; les Couronnes, &amp; les Richesses, &amp; la Renommée, &amp; une infinité d'Esperances, &amp; le temps qu'on donne au Jeu, &amp; les Aumônes qu'on fait faire aprés sa mort, &amp; les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes, &amp; les Soûpirs des Amans. </p><p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune. N'y eût-il que vous, Madame, repris-je en badinant, vous y avez fait aller tous ceux qu'on vous a adressez, &amp; c'est dequoy faire dans la Lune un amas considerable. Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">C'est que les Papes ont prétendu être Maîtres de Rome &amp; de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, &amp; la verité est qu'on ne sauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie.</span></span> Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres bien conservé. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus.</span></span> Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, &amp; qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, &amp; sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune.</span></span> Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà. Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre?</span></span> Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour</span></span>, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut. En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne. Mais pour achever de m'ôter le mien, dites-moy, &amp; dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune; car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une manière assez positive. Moi, repris- je. Je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune. Voyez combien la face de la Nature est changée d'icy à la Chine; d'autres Visages, d'autres Figures, d'autres Moeurs, &amp; presque d'autres Principes de raisonnement. D'icy à la Lune le changement doit être bien plus considerable. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine;</span></span> qui pourrait pousser jusqu'à la Lune, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit.</span></span> </p><p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience? De bonne foy, Madame, repliquay-je, je n'en say rien. S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, &amp; que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; &amp; si d'ailleurs nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eût ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures qu'on appelle le Genre humain? Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eût des passions si folles, &amp; des reflexions si sages; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">une durée si courte, &amp; des veües si longues</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles</span></span>, &amp; tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, &amp; tant d'inclination à la Servitude; une si forte envie d'être heureux, &amp; une si grande incapacité de l'être? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mêmes</span></span>, &amp; nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits. On a eté réduit à dire que les Dieux etoient plein de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes, &amp; que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sang froid, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire.</span></span> Nous voila donc bien en seureté du côté des Gens de la Lune, dit la Marquise, ils ne nous devineront pas; mais je voudrais que nous les pussions deviner, car en verité cela inquiete, de savoir qu'ils sont là-haut, dans cette Lune que nous voyons, &amp; de ne pouvoir pas se figurer comment ils sont faits. Et pourquoi, rêpondis-je, n'avez-vous point d'inquietude sur les Habitans de cette grande <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">Terre Australe</span></span> qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe? Nous sommes portés eux &amp; nous sur un même Vaisseau dont ils occupent la Proüe, &amp; nous la Pouppe. Vous voyez que de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, &amp; qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font, &amp; vous voudriez savoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux? </p><p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir</span></span>; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">cela est desesperant</span></span>. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas?</span></span> Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je?</span></span> Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites.</span></span> Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller.</span></span> On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou.</span></span> Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean.</span></span> Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"25\">je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier.</span></span> Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"26\">Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que</span></span> la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"27\">&amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire</span></span>, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"28\">Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes</span></span>, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"29\">&amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas?</span></span> Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"30\">Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre.</span></span> Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"31\">Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"32\">Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune.</span></span> Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"33\">qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites.</span></span> J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. Ah! vous me soulagez, répliqua la Marquise, votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"34\">je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement</span></span>, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of.</p> <p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse.</p> <p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</p> <p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</p> <p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"32\"></span></span><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"31\"></span></span><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\"></span></span><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\"></span></span><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\"></span></span><p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions.</span></span> See what he treats of. </p><p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">flying Horse</span></span> had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self.</span></span> The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full.

This removal of a dense, historically specific, and potentially controversial passage significantly simplifies the text by reducing its informational load and length.","The interactive rhetorical question \"Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune.\" (But guess what sort of thing one does not find in the Moon.) and its direct answer \"De la Folie.\" (Folly.) are omitted. The translation moves directly to the consequence, simplifying the text by removing this engaging but structurally more complex element.","The exclamatory clause \"En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus\" (In compensation, it is unbelievable how many lost Wits there are in the Moon) is omitted. This simplifies the text by removing an emphatic descriptive detail, thus reducing the density of the narrative.","The complex French double negative construction \"il n'est pas possible que... je ne vous fasse avoir\" (it is not possible that... I do not make you have) is simplified into a more direct positive statement: \"'tis possible... I shall... make you have.\" This change in sentence structure enhances readability by avoiding convoluted negation.","The original French presents Ariosto's address to his mistress as a direct rhetorical question: \"Qui montera aux Cieux...?\" (Who will ascend to the Heavens...?). The translation changes this into an indirect statement beginning with \"That I ought to cause one to mount...\", simplifying the sentence by altering its mood from interrogative to declarative, which is often more straightforward to process.","The French text uses the subjunctive mood \"qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit\" (that one never lost one's mind). The translation simplifies this to the indicative mood: \"that a Man never loses his Wits.\" This is a common simplification in French-to-English translation that makes the sentence structure more direct.","The French phrase \"à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve\" (hardly are they Men, the Inhabitants one finds there) uses a literary inversion. The English translation simplifies this to a more standard word order: \"finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men.\" More significantly, the impactful qualifier \"presque sans aucune raison humaine\" (almost without any human reason) is omitted from this immediate part of the description in the target, simplifying the initial characterization by reducing its density.","The French text makes a strong assertion: \"assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit\" (assuredly it would no longer be Men that one would find there). The translation softens this to an expression of opinion: \"I do not think we should find Men and Women there.\" This reduction in assertive force simplifies the statement by making it less definitive and more speculative.","The concise French phrase \"des veües si longues\" (such long views/sights) is expanded and explicated in the English translation as \"and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it.\" This elaboration clarifies the abstract meaning of \"long views,\" simplifying comprehension by making the concept more concrete and easier to visualize.","The French phrase \"des choses presque inutiles\" (almost useless things) is translated using the single, more common English noun \"Trifles.\" This simplifies the vocabulary by replacing a descriptive adjectival phrase with a concise and familiar noun.","The French general reference \"tout cela\" (all that) and the verb \"devinoient\" (guessed/divined) are expanded in English to \"find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition.\" This elaboration makes the philosopher's abstract point more concrete and the intellectual task of the Moon's inhabitants clearer, simplifying by reducing ambiguity.","The French adverb \"incessamment\" (incessantly, unceasingly), which is somewhat formal, is replaced by the more common and simpler English adverb \"daily.\"","The concise French \"d'en rire\" (to laugh about it/at it) is expanded in the English translation to \"laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work.\" This explicitation clarifies the object and reason for the Gods' laughter, simplifying comprehension by removing ambiguity.","The somewhat learned geographical term \"Terre Australe\" (Southern Land) is replaced by the more direct and specific description \"Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole.\" This simplifies the reference for a general reader by using common geographical locators instead of a less familiar proper term.","The French verb \"connoîtra\" (will know / will get to know), referring to understanding or becoming familiar with the inhabitants, is simplified to the more direct and visually oriented verb \"see\" in the English translation.","The strong French adjective \"desesperant\" (despairing, hopeless) is rendered as the milder English phrase \"'tis that that vexes me.\" This toning down of emotional intensity can be seen as a simplification, making the Marquise's reaction less dramatic or complex.","The complex French double negative \"je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir\" (literally, I no longer want to swear that there cannot be) is simplified to the more straightforward English construction \"I will not swear, but there may be.\" This phrasing is easier to parse and directly conveys the possibility rather than negating an impossibility.","The complex French past conditional/subjunctive structure \"eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir\" (would they have believed that there should have been [commerce]) is significantly simplified. The English translation restructures this into a more direct question about having \"any Reason to hope for,\" reducing grammatical complexity.","The philosopher's rhetorical deflection \"Qui vous dit le contraire?\" (Who tells you the contrary?) is replaced by the direct admission \"I do not deny it.\" This simplifies the conversational exchange by making the philosopher's stance explicit rather than implied through a question.","The French phrase \"je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites\" (I am not content with the admission you make of it) is rendered more concisely and directly as \"it is not sufficient to confess it.\" This simplifies the original phrasing by using a more common and less periphrastic expression.","The somewhat formal French \"nous nous figurerions bien\" (we would well imagine) is simplified to the more colloquial and direct English \"we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter.\" Furthermore, the general condition \"si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller\" (if one could effectively go there) is simplified by being made more concrete and practical: \"if we cou'd support our selves.\"","The French construction \"Je ne consentiray point... qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à...\" (I will not agree at all... that one ever flies, except in a way to...) is simplified. The English \"I will never yield... that Men will ever be able to fly without...\" presents a more direct and less convoluted sentence structure.","The specific French description of the outcome of perfecting navigation, \"jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean\" (to the point of being able to cross the Ocean), is reduced to the more general phrase \"for performing Navigation.\" This simplification omits the detailed extent of the achievement.","The French phrase \"pour le fortifier\" (to strengthen it [the argument]) is translated with the more colloquial and arguably simpler English expression \"to enforce 'em, and make all good.\"","The French reflexive construction \"se tenoient bien sûrs que\" (held themselves very sure that, or were very sure that) is simplified to the more common and direct active verb phrase \"The Ancients believed.\"","The French descriptive statement \"la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire\" (the general Map of the Earth was hardly more extensive than the Map of their Empire) is simplified by being rephrased as an active interpretation: \"the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire.\" This is more direct and less nuanced than the original comparison of extent.","The somewhat idiomatic and slightly formal French passive construction \"il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes\" (literally, it did not fail that men were found; i.e., men were nevertheless found) is simplified to the direct active assertion \"But we know that there are Inhabitants.\" This is a more straightforward way of presenting the information.","The French rhetorical question \"& puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, & la tête en bas?\" (and then would they have had their feet up, and their head down?), which expresses the perceived absurdity of antipodes, is simplified into a declarative statement of disbelief: \"Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down;\" This makes the point more directly.","The short, somewhat exclamatory French noun phrases \"Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre\" (New reformation to the Map, new half of the Earth) are converted into more standard English clausal structures: \"the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World.\" This simplifies the abrupt style into a smoother, more conventional narrative flow.","The explanatory clauses \"Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, & qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre\" (We are not there yet, because all the Earth is not discovered, & that apparently all that must happen in order) are omitted from the English translation. This simplification removes a step in the philosopher's reasoning, reducing the textual density and overall length.","The philosopher's concluding sentence in this part of the argument, \"Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune\" (When we have well known our own dwelling, we will be permitted to know that of our Neighbors, the People of the Moon), is entirely omitted. This simplifies the text by removing this final piece of sequential reasoning and speculation.","The convoluted French double negative \"qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites\" (that it is not possible that you do not truly believe what you say) is simplified. The English translation uses \"that I doubt not but you believe all you say,\" which, while still a double negative, is a more standard and somewhat easier to process idiomatic construction in English.","The somewhat formal French phrasing \"je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement\" (I feel myself more in a state/condition to go to bed tranquilly) is simplified to the more direct and idiomatic English \"now I can go sleep soundly.\""]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">TROISIEME SOIR.

Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">voltigent</span></span> irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface</span></span>, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">s'assembleroient diversement</span></span>, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">&amp; voilà le malheur.</span></span> A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune.

Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste.</span></span> Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">indétermination</span></span>, j'ay besoin de croire.

Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point</span></span>, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës</span></span>, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">une froideur qui les a resserrées</span></span>, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées</span></span> pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée.</span></span> Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte</span></span>, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres</span></span>, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"25\">ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées.</span></span> Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"26\">voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.</span></span> Cela nous fournira des fruits, des blés, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons.

We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, as the Earth is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change; there lies the difficulty: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are at from the Moon. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination and a Kindness for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling. It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon (for certainly it emits Vapours;) and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain: And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence; so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, with a little Knowledge; but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">I told her</span></span>, 'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them.

The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">move</span></span> regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface</span></span>; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">meeting together in different Figures</span></span>, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, as the Earth is; but on the contrary, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">there lies the difficulty:</span></span> And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest</span></span>, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other.</span></span> Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">guessing is pardonable</span></span>, at the great distance we are at from the Moon. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">Indifference</span></span>, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">never to be heard of again</span></span>; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination and a Kindness for 'em, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">I wou'd not willingly lose</span></span>. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change</span></span>, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen</span></span>; which meeting with <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed</span></span>, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together</span></span>, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew, so very subtile, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling.</span></span> It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon (<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">for certainly it emits Vapours;</span></span>) and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">and so equal a temper, one with the other</span></span>, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"25\">but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain:</span></span> And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"26\">which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence;</span></span> so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"27\">of whose Nature I know nothing</span></span>; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, with a little Knowledge; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"28\">but we must have patience</span></span>: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","explanations":["The formal French verb \"representay\" (I represented/pointed out) is simplified to the more common and direct \"I told her,\" reducing lexical formality.","The French \"Conversations savantes\" (learned/scholarly conversations) is translated to \"Philosophical Entertainment.\" \"Entertainment\" simplifies the intellectual weight implied by \"savantes,\" making the activity sound more leisurely and less academically rigorous, thus simplifying the vocabulary and tone.","The French modal \"pourroit bien ne l'être point\" (could well not be so) is rendered with the added explicit internal thought process \"now I begin to think,\" which simplifies the statement by making the speaker's changing perspective more overt and less reliant on the reader's inference from the modal verb alone.","The French rhetorical question expressing the Marquise's disbelief (\"and today they wouldn't even be in the world?\") is changed into a declarative statement directed at the philosopher (\"you will not allow them a being in the Universe:\"). This simplifies the grammatical structure from interrogative to declarative, making the exchange more straightforward.","The French \"de son esprit\" (of one's mind/spirit) within the longer sentence is translated as \"of ones Thoughts and Belief.\" This expansion specifies and simplifies the somewhat more abstract \"esprit,\" making the philosopher's advice more concrete by narrowing the scope of what should be partially withheld.","The French \"Sentences\" (referring to maxims or pithy, perhaps evasive, statements) is translated as \"fair Words.\" This simplifies the specific meaning of \"Sentences\" to a more general term, reducing the intellectual nuance of the Marquise's objection by using more common vocabulary.","The French \"raisonner de la Lune\" (reason about the Moon) is expanded to \"reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon.\" This addition specifies the focus of the reasoning (\"the Inhabitants\") which was implied in the original, thereby simplifying the statement by making its subject more explicit and reducing ambiguity.","The French verb \"voltigent\" (flutter, hover, wheel about), which conveys a specific and somewhat irregular type of movement, is simplified to the more general and less descriptive verb \"move,\" using more common vocabulary.","The concise French hypothetical clause starting with \"Qui verroit\" (One who would see / Whoever were to see) is expanded into a more explicit and grammatically less dense conditional structure: \"And if it were possible for any one to see and consider.\" This unwraps the condensed meaning of the French, simplifying the sentence structure for easier parsing.","The French \"s'assembleroient diversement\" (would gather themselves variously/in different ways) uses the adverb \"diversement\" to describe the manner of assembly. The English translation \"meeting together in different Figures\" simplifies this by providing a more concrete and visually specific image (\"in different Figures\") instead of the more abstract adverbial modification.","The concise French statement is significantly expanded in English. \"taches\" becomes \"Obscurities, or dark places,\" and the state of being fixed (\"sont fixes, le sont toûjours\") is elaborated into \"are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change.\" This expansion breaks down the concepts into more digestible parts and uses redundancy to ensure comprehension, simplifying the density of the original.","The French \"& voilà le malheur\" (and there's the misfortune/unhappiness/bad luck) carries a slightly more dramatic or personal tone. The English \"there lies the difficulty\" simplifies this by using a more neutral and analytical term, reducing the emotive coloring and stylistic richness of the original.","The French reflexive construction \"se dégagent\" (disengage themselves) is translated into the English passive voice \"are easily separated.\" This common translational shift simplifies the structure by removing the reflexive element, often making the sentence more direct for English readers.","The complex French sentence, describing the natural co-occurrence of evaporations and water and a logical deduction, is simplified. The English replaces the process description (\"elles se font... où il y a des Eaux\") with a statement of inherent property (\"are so essential and natural to Waters\") and rephrases the convoluted conclusion (\"qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point\") into a more direct and common expression: \"'tis impossible the one can be without the other.\" This simplifies both sentence structure and the articulation of logic.","The French phrase, meaning \"it is permitted/allowed not to guess quite accurately,\" which has a slightly formal and indirect tone, is simplified to the more concise and direct \"guessing is pardonable.\" This uses more common vocabulary and a simpler grammatical construction.","The French \"indétermination\" (indecision, inability to determine) is translated as \"Indifference.\" While related, \"Indifference\" is a more common and arguably simpler term than the abstract \"indétermination,\" potentially making the Marquise's statement more accessible by simplifying vocabulary.","The French impersonal subjunctive construction \"& qu'il n'en soit plus parlé\" (and that it/they be no longer spoken of) is translated into the more common English idiom \"never to be heard of again.\" This simplifies the grammatical structure and uses more familiar phrasing.","The French \"j'aurois de la peine à perdre\" (I would have difficulty/trouble/pain in losing) expresses a stronger degree of attachment. The English \"I wou'd not willingly lose\" softens this to a preference or reluctance, simplifying the emotional intensity and phrasing it in a more common, understated way.","The concise French \"l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point\" (the appearance of the Moon's spots doesn't change) is expanded. \"Taches\" becomes \"obscure and enlightened places,\" and \"ne change point\" is elaborated as \"which are still the same, without change.\" This repetition and elaboration simplifies by reducing the density of the original statement.","The French uses a past descriptive tense \"êtaient separées\" (were separated) linked to \"au sortir de la Terre\" (on leaving the Earth). The English simplifies this to a present tense \"are separate,\" presenting it as a general characteristic, thereby simplifying the temporal framing of the process.","The French \"une froideur\" (a coldness – an abstract noun) is made more concrete in English as \"cold Airs.\" The active French \"qui les a resserrées\" (which has condensed them) is changed to a passive \"by it are condensed,\" simplifying the structure by making the agent less direct.","The French reflexive \"se tiennent ... dispersées\" (keep themselves/remain dispersed) is translated using passive constructions \"are extended, and kept from joining together.\" This explicates the state of being dispersed, simplifying the more condensed reflexive form by making the mechanism clearer.","The French \"qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée\" (that one does not see fall from any cloud) involves an active observer and specifies a detail (from any cloud). The English simplifies to the passive \"it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling,\" removing the explicit observer and the specific cloud detail, making the statement more general and less detailed.","The French \"car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte\" (for, after all, some [vapours] must come out of it) expresses a logical necessity. The English \"for certainly it emits Vapours;\" simplifies this by making a more direct and assertive statement, replacing the nuanced modality of \"il faut que\" with a straightforward assertion.","The French \"toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres\" (all equally at rest beside one another) describes a physical state. The English \"and so equal a temper, one with the other\" translates this into a more abstract quality (\"equal temper\"). This shift from a concrete physical description to a more general quality simplifies the imagery.","The French uses the future tense \"ne retomberont point\" (will not fall back). The English translation shifts to the present tense \"fall gently,\" simplifying the temporal aspect by presenting it as a general action rather than a future prediction.","The French \"voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent\" (there are its Inhabitants who are reborn) and \"nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance\" (we have the necessary basis for their subsistence) is rephrased. The English uses the specific term \"Food,\" which simplifies the more general \"fond necessaire pour leur subsistance\" by making the means of subsistence more concrete and commonly understood.","The French \"que je fais profession de ne pas connoître\" (which I profess not to know) has a formal phrasing. The English \"of whose Nature I know nothing\" is more direct and concise, simplifying the expression by removing the element of formal profession.","The French \"mais il faut s'en consoler\" (but one must console oneself for it) implies accepting a disappointment. The English \"but we must have patience\" simplifies this by substituting a more common exhortation, potentially reducing the psychological complexity of the original phrase."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empêcher la communication des deux Planetes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">S'il ne tenoit qu'à voler;</span></span> que savons-nous, comme je vous disois hier, si on ne volera pas fort bien quelque jour? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">J'avoüe pourtant qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup d'apparence.</span></span> Le grand éloignement de la Lune à la Terre serait encore une difficulté à surmonter, qui est assurement considerable, mais quand même elle ne s'y rencontreroit pas, quand même les deux Planetes seroient proches, il ne seroit pas possible de passer de l'Air de l'une dans l'air de l'autre.

The English translation simplifies this predicate by using the single, more direct verb 'hinder,' making the sentence structure more concise around the main action.","The French 'S'il ne tenoit qu'à voler;' is an idiomatic and somewhat abstract phrase (lit. 'If it only depended on/held to flying;'). The English 'If flying wou'd do the business,' translates this into a more colloquial and concrete English idiom, making the meaning more immediately accessible by using a more common phrasal construction of the period.","The French 'qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup d'apparence.' (lit. 'that there isn't much appearance/likelihood.') is a concise assessment. The English 'there seems but little likelihood of what I say,' makes the object of 'likelihood' explicit by adding 'of what I say.' This explicitation simplifies the reader's task by making the meaning more direct and less reliant on immediate contextual inference, thus enhancing readability.","The French phrase 'ils ne passent jamais dans l'Air des Oiseaux dans l'air des Poissons;' is syntactically complex or ambiguous, possibly implying a reciprocal movement or a specific condition. The English translation 'who never pass into the Air and Element of Birds;' simplifies this by presenting a clearer, unidirectional statement about fish, removing the syntactic complexity and potential ambiguity of the original, thus reducing its density for easier comprehension.","The French clause 'chacun a pour prison l'air qu'il respire.' (each one has for its prison the air it breathes) uses a vivid metaphor ('a pour prison'). The English translation in 'every one of 'em are confin'd to the Air which they breath.' replaces this more literary and figurative expression with a more direct and common phrasal verb ('are confin'd to'). This lexical choice simplifies the figurative language, making the meaning more literal and accessible.","In the French clause 'Nous trouvons que le nôtre est mêlé de vapeurs...', 'le nôtre' (ours) anaphorically refers to 'Air.' The English translation 'We find that our Air is mix'd with Vapours...' makes this reference explicit by stating 'our Air.' This explicitation simplifies the sentence by reducing the cognitive load on the reader to resolve the pronoun, thus enhancing readability.","Within this descriptive sentence, the French 'se noyeroit' (would drown) is translated as 'wou'd be drown'd and suffocated.' In the context of an alien atmosphere, adding 'and suffocated' clarifies the specific cause of death which 'drown'd' alone might ambiguously suggest (as drowning is typically associated with liquid).

But, answer'd I, if they had Skill enough to sail upon the external Surface of our Air, and that from thence they shou'd catch us, like Fish, out of a Curiosity of seeing us; wou'd that please you, Madam? Why not, said she, laughing? I wou'd go of my self into their Nets, to have the satisfaction of seeing those that had caught me. Consider, said I, that you wou'd be very weak and feeble, before you come to the Surface of our Air; for we cannot breath it in all its Extent, and we can hardly live on the Tops of high Mountains; and I wonder that those who are so foolish as to believe, that Corporeal Geniuses inhabit the purest Air, do not tell us why these Geniuses visit us so seldom, and stay so short a while: I do believe, 'tis because few amongst 'em know how to dive; and that even those who are skilful in that Art, have great difficulty to penetrate the grossness of the Air which we breath. You see therefore, that Nature has set many Bars and Fences, to hinder us from going out of our World, into that of the Moon. However, for our Satisfaction, let us conjecture and guess as much as we can of that world: For Example; I fansie that the Inhabitants of the Moon must see the Heavens, the Sun, and the Stars, of a different Colour than what they appear to us. All these Objects we see through a kind of natural Perspective-Glass, which changes them to us; this Perspective-glass of ours is mix'd with Vapours and Exhalations, which do not ascend very high. Some of late pretend, that the Air of it self is blew, as well as the Water of the Sea; and that that Colour is not apparent in the one, nor the other, but at a great depth: The Heavens, say they, in which are plac'd the fixed Stars, has of it self no Light; and by consequence, ought to appear black: But we see it through our Air, which is blew; and therefore the Heavens appear of that Colour. If it be so, the Beams of the Sun and Stars cannot pass through the Air, without taking a little of its Tincture, and at the same time lose as much of their own natural Colour: But supposing the Air had no Colour of it self, 'tis certain, that a Flambeau, seen at a distance, through a thick Fog, appears of a reddish Colour, tho' that be not natural to it; so all our Air, which is nothing else but a thick Fog, must certainly alter the true natural Colour of the Heavens, Sun and Stars to us; for nothing but the pure heavenly Substance is capable to convey to us Light and Colours, in their Purity and Perfection, as they are: So that the Air of the Moon is of another nature than our Air, or is, of it self, of an indifferent Colour; or, at least, is another Fog, changing, in appearance, the Colours of the Celestial Bodies.

This reduces the rhetorical intensity and density of the text.","The original French sentence is a single, highly complex construction using \"que... ne disent aussi que ce qui fait que... c'est que...\" to link ideas. The translation simplifies this by breaking it into two main clauses linked by a colon and introducing \"I do believe\". The complex causal structure \"ce qui fait que... c'est que...\" (what makes it that... it is that...) is simplified to the more direct \"why... 'tis because...\", significantly reducing sentence complexity.","The French impersonal construction \"qu'on y voye\" (that one sees there) is simplified by making the subject explicit in English: \"that the Inhabitants of the Moon must see\". This removes the ambiguity of the impersonal \"on\" and makes the sentence more concrete and easier for the reader to follow.","The French \"ne nous paroissent qu'au travers de\" (only appear to us through) frames the objects as the subject of \"appear.\" The translation shifts to an active voice construction \"All these Objects we see through,\" making \"we\" the active subject. This change makes the sentence structure more direct.","The French \"Cette Lunette, c'est notre Air\" employs a topic-comment structure common in French for emphasis. The English translation simplifies this to a more standard English sentence structure, \"this Perspective-glass of ours is mix'd...\", which directly attributes properties to the subject, making the sentence more linear.","The French \"de luy-même il est bleu\" uses the pronoun \"il\" referring to \"notre Air\" from a previous sentence. The translation simplifies this by explicitly stating \"that the Air of it self is blew,\" replacing the pronoun with its noun antecedent. This improves clarity and reduces the reader's cognitive load.","The French uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" (\"on le voit\" - one sees it) and later the pronoun \"il\" (\"il paraît bleu\" - it appears blue). The translation simplifies this by using the more direct \"we\" (\"we see it\"), replacing \"il\" with the explicit noun \"the Heavens,\" and adding \"therefore\" to make the causal link more explicit, simplifying the logical flow.","The French phrase \"& prendre autant de celle qui leur est naturelle\" (literally \"and take as much of that which is natural to them\") is somewhat ambiguous. The translation clarifies this by rendering it as \"and at the same time lose as much of their own natural Colour,\" making an implied consequence explicit and simplifying interpretation.","The French \"la lumiere d'un flambeau qu'on voit un peu de loin paroît...\" (the light of a torch that one sees from a bit far away appears...) uses an active relative clause with the impersonal \"on.\" The translation simplifies this structure by making \"a Flambeau\" the direct subject of \"appears\" and converting the clause to a passive participial phrase \"seen at a distance.\"","The French uses a formal, impersonal construction with a conditional verb: \"Il n'appartiendroit qu'à la matière céleste de...\" (It would only belong to celestial matter to...). The English translation simplifies this to a more direct affirmative statement: \"for nothing but the pure heavenly Substance is capable to convey...\", making the sentence structure simpler and more assertive.","The French uses a cleft sentence for emphasis: \"c'est un autre broüillard qui cause...\" (it is another fog that causes...). The English translation simplifies this by using a more direct structure: \"[the Air]... is another Fog, changing...\", where the relative clause is converted into a participial phrase, streamlining the sentence.","The French sentence focuses on \"cette Lunette\" (this lens) as the subject of a passive verb \"est changée\" (is changed), with an impersonal observer \"on\". The translation simplifies this by shifting to an active construction with an explicit agent: \"if there be Inhabitants in the Moon, they see all things chang'd...\".

The English \"which we enjoy by the by, or, as it were, by chance\" simplifies this concept into more common, idiomatic expressions. This reduces the formal, slightly philosophical nuance of \"par dessus ce qui nous est dû\" (over and above what is owed to us) to the simpler idea of chance or incidental benefit, making it more accessible but less rich in its original connotation.","The French \"renvoyer en en bas les rayons\" (literally, \"to send back down the rays\") uses a descriptive, somewhat periphrastic expression. The English \"reflecting the faint Beams of the Sun\" uses the more standard and concise scientific term \"reflecting\" for \"renvoyer en en bas,\" simplifying the original's more colloquial description of the physical action. The addition of \"faint Beams\" is an elaboration by the translator not present in this specific French phrase.","The French \"s'affoiblissant comme de nuance en nuance\" (weakening as if from shade to shade / nuance by nuance) is a highly literary and subtle description. The English \"becoming more faint by degrees\" simplifies this to a more common and less evocative phrase, losing the richness of \"nuance en nuance.\" Additionally, \"sa perte\" (its loss) is rendered as \"the Absence of the Sun,\" a more standard and perhaps less poignant phrasing.","The French \"tout l'éclat qui est dans le Soleil\" (all the brilliance/radiance that is in the Sun) uses the abstract noun \"l'éclat.\" The English \"the Rays of the Sun\" uses a more concrete term \"Rays,\" which can be considered a simplification by making the imagery more direct and less abstract, thus more accessible to a general reader.","The French \"nous devons les plus belles choses du monde à celles qui le sont le moins\" (we owe the most beautiful things in the world to those that are the least so [beautiful]) is concise and relies on the reader understanding the implied contrast. The English translation simplifies this by making the contrast explicit: \"we owe the Obligation of the most agreeable and pleasant Effects, to the ugliest and most dis- agreeable Causes in Nature.\" It replaces the subtle \"celles qui le sont le moins\" with the very direct \"ugliest and most dis- agreeable Causes,\" removing ambiguity and the need for inference, thereby simplifying the cognitive load for the reader.","The French \"les Belles de ce Pays-là\" (the Beauties of that Country) is a general term for beautiful women. The English translation narrows this down to \"their Mistresses,\" contextualized by the added phrase \"the Lovers in the Moon\" (which is an addition by the translator not present in the immediate French context). This simplification makes the scenario more specific and conventional (lovers comparing mistresses), rather than the broader, more abstract reference to \"Beauties\" and their potential descriptions in general.","The French \"Quelle source de comparaisons perduë!\" is an expressive, standalone exclamation lamenting the loss of a source of poetic comparisons. The English translation simplifies this by omitting the direct exclamation and instead integrating the idea of loss into the preceding question with the phrase \"without these two things?\". This change makes the overall expression more direct and less overtly rhetorical, reducing its stylistic richness for a simpler conveyance of the core idea."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P048: Je n'aurois pas grand regret à ces comparaisons là, dit la Marquise, &amp; je trouve qu'on est assez bien recompense dans la Lune, de n'avoir ny Aurore ny Arc-en- ciel, car on ne doit avoir par la même raison ny Foudres ny Tonnerres, puisque ce sont aussi des choses qui se forment dans les nüages.

Ils n'habitent peut-être point ailleurs, c'est là qu'ils bâtissent leurs Villes. Nous voyons icy que la Rome soûterraine êtoit presque aussi grande que la Rome qui est sur Terre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Il ne faudroit qu'ôter celle-cy, le reste seroit une Ville à la manière de la Lune.</span></span> Tout un Peuple est dans un Puits, &amp; d'un Puits à l'autre il y a des chemins soûterrains pour la communication des Peuples. Vous vous moquez de cette vision, j'y consens de tout mon cur; cependant, à vous parler tres serieusement, vous pourriez vous tromper plutôt que moy. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Vous croyez que les Gens de la Lune doivent habiter sur la surface de leur Planete, parce que nous habitons sur la surface de la nôtre: c'est tout le contraire, puisque nous habitons sur la surface de notre Planete, ils pourraient bien n'habiter pas sur la surface de la leur.</span></span> D'icy là il faut que toutes choses soient bien différentes.  </p><p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle. Vous y auriez encore plus de peine, répris-je, si vous saviez qu'un grand Philosophe de l'Antiquité a fait de la Lune le séjour des âmes qui ont merité icy d'être bien-heureuses. Toute leur felicité consiste en ce qu'elles y entendent l'Harmonie que les Corps Celestes font par leurs mouvements; mais comme il pretend que quand la Lune tombe dans l'ombre de la Terre, elles ne peuvent plus entendre cette Harmonie; alors, dit-il, ces Ames crient comme des desesperées, &amp; la Lune se hâte le plus qu'elle peut de les tirer d'un endroit si fâcheux. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Nous devrions donc, répliqua-t-elle, voir arriver icy les Bienheureux de la Lune, car apparemment on nous les envoye aussi; &amp; dans ces deux Planetes on croit avoir assez pourveu à la felicité des Ames, de les avoir transportées dans un autre Monde.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Serieusement, repris-je, ce ne seroit pas un plaisir mediocre de voir plusieurs Mondes differens.</span></span> Ce Voyage me réjoüit quelquefois beaucoup à ne le faire qu'en imagination, &amp; que seroit-ce, si on le faisoit en effet? Cela vaudroit bien mieux que d'aller d'icy au Japon, c'est- à-dire de ramper avec beaucoup de peine d'un point de la Terre sur un autre, pour ne voir que des hommes. Eh bien, dit-elle, faisons le Voyage des Planètes comme nous pourrons; qui nous en empêche? Allons nous placer dans tous ces differens points de veuê, &amp; de là considérons l'Univers. N'avons- nous plus rien à voir dans la Lune? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Je croy que non, répondis-je</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">du moins je vous y ay fait voir tout ce qui êtoit de ma connoissance.</span></span> Au sortir de la Lune en tirant vers le Soleil, on trouve Vénus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Sur Vénus je reprens le Saint-Denis.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">Vénus tourne sur elle-même, &amp; autour du Soleil comme la Lune,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">on découvre avec les Lunettes d'approche, que Vénus aussi bien que la Lune est tantôt en Croissant, tantôt en Décours, tantôt pleine selon les diverses situations où elle est à l'égard de la Terre.</span></span> La Lune, selon toutes les apparences, est habitée, pourquoy Vénus ne le sera-t-elle pas aussi? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Mais, interrompit-elle, en disant toüjours Pourquoy non, vous m'allez mettre des Habitans dans toutes les Planètes?</span></span> N'en doutez pas, répliquay-je, ce Pourquoy a une vertu qui suffira pour peupler tout. Nous voyons que toutes les Planètes sont de la même Nature, toutes des Corps opaques qui ne reçoivent de la lumière que du Soleil, qui se la renvoyent les uns aux autres, &amp; qui n'ont que les mêmes mouvements, jusque là tout est égal. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Cependant, il faudroit concevoir que ces grands Corps auroient êté faits pour n'être point habitez, que ce seroit là leur condition naturelle, &amp; qu'il y aurait une exception justement en faveur de la Terre toute seule.</span></span> Qui voudra le croire, le croye; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">pour moi, je ne m'y puis pas resoudre?</span></span> Je vous trouve, dit-elle, bien affermy dans vôtre opinion depuis quelques instans. Je viens de voir le moment que la Lune seroit deserte, &amp; que vous ne vous en souciîez pas beaucoup, &amp; presentement si on osoit vous dire que toutes les Planetes ne sont pas aussi habitées que la Terre, je voy bien que vous vous mettriez en colere.

They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another. You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other? Seriously, said I, Madam, 'twould be a great Pleasure and Satisfaction to see several different Worlds; and I am often glad, to make these Journeys in Imagination; what joy then it wou'd be to do it in reality; that wou'd be far better than to travel from hence to Iapan, crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again. Well, said she, what hinders, but we shou'd make a Journey through the Planets as well as we can? Let us by imagination place our selves in several Positions, and situations, fit for considering the Universe. Have we no more to see in the Moon? No, said I, at least, I have shown you all I know. Going out of the Moon towards the Sun, the first Planet you meet with is Venus; and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis. Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, as the Moon does round the Earth; and by the means of Telescopes, we discover that Venus waxes and wanes, being sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened according to her different Positions in respect to the Earth.</p> <p>P037: By all appearance the Moon is inhabited, why shou'd not Venus be so, as well as she? Ay, but interrupted the Marquiese by your why nots, you will people all the Planets. Do not doubt of it, Madam, answer'd I; why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all? We see that all the Planets are of the same Nature, that they are all Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun; which they send one to another by Reflection, and that they have all the same kind of motion; thus far equal, and after all this must we conceive that all these vast Bodies were made not to be inhabited? And that Nature has made only an exception in Favor of the Earth, he that will believe this, may, but for my part I cannot. I find you, said the Marquiese, very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited. It is true, Madam, in the minute wherein you have surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me, as to the Inhabitants of all the Planets, I wou'd not only have defended my opinion, but have proceeded, to have given you an exact description of all the several Inhabitants of the Planets. There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it. The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there. And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates. If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,) and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures. Several Bodies, which appear to be solid, are nothing else but Collections or little heaps of these imperceptible Animals; who find there as much room, as is requisite for them to move in. The leaf of a Tree, is a little World inhabited, by such invisible little Worms: To them this leaf seems of a vast Extent, they find Hills and Valleys upon it: And there is no more Communication between the living Creatures on the one side, and those on the other, than between us and the Antipodes. And I think there is more reason, to believe a Planet (which is so vast a Body) to be inhabited. There has been found in several sorts of very hard Stones, infinite multitudes of little Worms, lodg'd all over them in insensible varieties; and who are nourish'd upon the Substance of these Stones which they eat. Consider the vast Numbers of these little Animals, and how long a tract of Years they have liv'd upon a grain of Sand. And by this Argument, tho my Moon were nothing but a confus'd heap of Marble Rocks, I wou'd rather make it be devour'd and consum'd by its Inhabitants, than to place none at all in it.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P036: I do much regret that loss, said the Marquiese, for in my Opinion, the Inhabitants of the Moon are fully recompens'd for the want of the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light, since for the same Reason, they have neither Thunder nor Lightning, both which are produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations; they enjoy bright serene Days, and never lose the Sun by Day, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">nor the Stars by Night.</span></span> They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven.

The English translation reduces this to the general phrase \"in these hollow places,\" omitting specific comparative and locational details, thereby simplifying the text by reducing descriptive density.","The concise French \"Il ne faudroit qu'ôter celle-cy\" (It would only be necessary to remove the latter) is expanded into a more explicit conditional clause. This elaboration spells out the referent of \"celle-cy\" and the method of removal, simplifying the text by making implicit information explicit and reducing the reader's inferential load.","The original French employs a specific ironic argument (since we inhabit Earth's surface, Moon dwellers might not inhabit theirs). The English translation replaces this with a more general assertion about the difference in living ways, simplifying the original by omitting a nuanced piece of reasoning and substituting a less complex statement.","The Marquise's original reasoning in French is replaced. The English version introduces a rhetorical question and reframes part of the argument as a condition of the philosopher's view. This restructuring makes the argument more explicit and arguably easier to follow, simplifying the original's somewhat elliptical and ironic argumentative style.","The French uses litotes (\"un plaisir mediocre,\" meaning a great pleasure). The English translation simplifies this by stating the meaning directly (\"a great Pleasure and Satisfaction\"), removing the rhetorical figure for a more straightforward expression.","The French \"Je croy que non\" (I believe not) is a slightly more elaborate negation than the direct and simpler \"No\" used in the English translation. This simplification makes the dialogue more concise.","The French phrase \"tout ce qui êtoit de ma connoissance\" (all that was of my knowledge) is somewhat formal and periphrastic. The English \"all I know\" simplifies this to a more direct and common expression.","The concise French allusion \"je reprens le Saint-Denis\" (I resume the Saint-Denis) is clarified in English as \"I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis.\" This explicit clarification simplifies the reference for readers potentially unfamiliar with the earlier comparison.","The French \"comme la Lune\" (like the Moon) is ambiguous in its comparison. The English clarifies this by specifying Venus turns \"on her own Axis\" and orbits the Sun \"as the Moon does round the Earth,\" removing ambiguity and simplifying comprehension of the scientific comparison.","The specific French astronomical terms for moon phases (\"en Croissant, tantôt en Décours, tantôt pleine\") are replaced by the general English \"waxes and wanes\" and then described by visual appearance (\"sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened\"). This simplifies by using more common descriptive language instead of potentially unfamiliar technical terms.","The French phrase \"en disant toüjours Pourquoy non\" (by always saying Why not) is simplified into the concise and colloquial nominalization \"by your why nots\" in English, making the interjection punchier.","The French text lists three linked conceptions that would need to be believed if planets were uninhabited. The English translation omits the middle conception (\"que ce seroit là leur condition naturelle\"). This omission simplifies the argument by reducing the number of points being refuted, thereby decreasing textual density.","The French \"je ne m'y puis pas resoudre\" (I cannot bring myself to resolve/accept it) is a slightly more elaborate reflexive construction. The English \"I cannot [believe this]\" is more direct and simpler in its phrasing.","The French \"je vous les aurois soutenus\" (I would have maintained/supported them [the inhabitants/arguments] to you) is somewhat ambiguous. The English \"I wou'd not only have defended my opinion\" simplifies by making the object (\"my opinion\") explicit and less ambiguous.","The French phrase \"un peu plus de sens froid\" (literally \"a bit more of cold sense\") is simplified by using the more common and standard English idiom \"after cooler Thoughts.\"","The French \"je ne laisse pas de trouver\" (I do not fail to find / I still find) is simplified to the more direct \"I shou'd think.\" Additionally, the negated state \"ne le fussent point du tout\" (should not be [inhabited] at all) is replaced by the descriptive phrase \"shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted,\" simplifying the structure and using more common vocabulary.","The French \"tout ce qui habite la Terre\" (all that which inhabits Earth) is more abstract.

This simplifies the dense original imagery through elaboration.","The French \"il y a quelque apparence que\" (it appears somewhat likely that) is simplified to \"And it may be.\" The French syntax for causation is restructured into a more standard English sentence (\"the different tastes... proceed from... Animals\"), and \"piqueures\" (pricks/stings) is simplified to the more common verbs \"bite, and sting.\"","The French \"autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut\" (as much freedom as they need) for the creatures' movements is translated to \"as much room... for them to move in.\" \"Room\" is a more concrete and common term in this physical context than the abstract \"liberté\" (freedom), simplifying the vocabulary.","The French \"connaissent\" (know/are acquainted with) is simplified to \"find.\" The grander terms \"Montagnes & des Abîmes\" (Mountains & Abysses) are replaced by the more common and less dramatic \"Hills and Valleys,\" simplifying vocabulary and imagery.","The concise French rhetorical construction \"A plus forte raison, ce me semble, une grosse Planete sera-t-elle un Monde habité\" is unpacked into a more straightforward English sentence structure, with elements like \"A plus forte raison\" becoming \"there is more reason\" and the stylistic inversion replaced by a standard infinitive phrase, simplifying the original's dense phrasing.","The specific French verb \"rongeaient\" (gnawed) is replaced by the more general and simpler verb \"eat,\" simplifying the vocabulary."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P051: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë</span></span>, dit la Marquise, mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planètes, &amp; embarrassée de la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux; car je voy bien que la Nature, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions</span></span>, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Ce n'est pas à l'imagination à prétendre le représenter</span></span>, répondis-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">elle n'êst pas propre à aller plus loin que les yeux.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">On peut seulement apercevoir d'une certaine veuë universelle, la diversité que la Nature doit avoir mise entre tous ces Mondes.</span></span> Tous les visages sont en general sur un même modele; mais ceux de deux grandes Nations, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">comme des Européens, si vous voulez, &amp; des Africains</span></span>, paroissent être faits sur deux modeles particuliers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">&amp; il faudroit encore trouver le modele des visages de chaque Famille.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Quel secret doit avoir eu la Nature pour varier en tant de manieres une chose aussi simple qu'un visage?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Nous ne sommes dans l'Univers que comme une petite Famille</span></span>, dont tous les visages se ressemblent; dans une autre Planète, c'est une autre Famille dont les visages ont un autre air.. </p><p>P052: Apparemment les differences augmentent à mesure que l'on s'éloigne, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">&amp; qui verroit un Habitant de la Lune, &amp; un Habitant de la Terre, remarqueroit bien qu'ils seroient de deux Mondes plus voisins qu'un Habitant de la Terre &amp; un Habitant de Saturne.</span></span> Icy, par exemple, on a l'usage de la voix, ailleurs on ne parle que par signes; plus loin on ne parle point du tout.

The translation changes this into a practical admonition (\"let us be satisfied with our Eyes\"), simplifying the descriptive nuance into direct advice.","The French \"On peut seulement apercevoir\" (One can only perceive) with \"d'une certaine veuë\" (with a certain view) suggests a limited, specific way of perceiving. The English \"we may easily conceive\" is less restrictive (omitting \"seulement\" and \"certaine\") and uses \"conceive\" which is more abstract. The modal \"doit avoir mise\" (must have put) is simplified to \"has form'd,\" removing the nuance of inference.","The polite conversational filler \"si vous voulez\" (if you wish / if you will) is omitted, making the sentence more direct and less characteristic of Fontenelle's conversational style, thus simplifying the rhetorical texture.","The French \"il faudroit encore trouver\" (one would still need to find), implying ongoing inquiry, is simplified to the English assertion \"Nay, there is...\", presenting the idea as a settled observation rather than a continuing search for a \"model.\"","The French rhetorical question \"Quel secret doit avoir eu la Nature\" (What secret must Nature have had), inviting speculation, is simplified into an exclamatory statement \"Yet it is wonderful to observe how...\", focusing on the observable outcome rather than the speculative 'secret.'","The translator adds \"the Inhabitants of the Earth\" to specify \"Nous\" (We). This explicitation simplifies by removing the reader's need to infer the referent, making the text more direct.","The French \"remarqueroit bien qu'ils seroient de deux Mondes plus voisins\" (would indeed notice that they would be from two more neighboring Worlds) explains the *reason* for similarity. The English \"he wou'd perceive less difference between them\" states the observation more directly, simplifying the original's causal implication about their origin.","The French \"ailleurs... plus loin...\" (elsewhere... further away...) implies a progression or increasing distance. The English \"in another Planet... In another...\" treats these as separate, equivalent examples without the same sense of graduated difference, simplifying the implied continuum.","The French \"se tourmente de\" (torments oneself about) conveys strong emotional distress. The English \"trouble our selves more to know\" shifts the emphasis to cognitive effort, simplifying or reducing the intensity of the original emotional expression.","The adjective \"naturel\" (natural) qualifying \"Sens\" (Sense) is omitted in the translation, slightly reducing the descriptive detail of the original text.","The focus shifts from the abstract location of the \"sixiéme Sens\" to the \"Inhabitants\" possessing it as an \"advantage.\" This person-centric rephrasing simplifies the concept. Also, \"quelqu'un des cinq\" (one of the five) is generalized to \"some of those other five,\" reducing specificity. The term \"advantage\" is an interpretive addition simplifying the implication by making it explicit.","The French \"dans le partage que nous avons fait avec les Habitans des autres Planètes, il ne nous en est échu que cinq\" describes a complex process of division or 'sharing'. The English simplifies this by focusing only on the outcome of allotment, \"the five that are fal'n to our Share,\" and omitting the active, negotiated aspect of \"partage que nous avons fait\" (sharing that we have done).","The formal French \"faute d'en connoître d'autres\" (for lack of knowing others / due to not knowing others) is simplified to the more colloquial and blunt English idiom \"because we know no better,\" reducing the formality of the original.","The French \"Nos Sciences\" (Our Sciences), referring to specific disciplines, is translated to the more general term \"Our Knowledge,\" simplifying the scope from structured scientific inquiry to general human understanding.","The French \"où elles [les Sciences] nous manquent tout à coup\" (where they [Sciences] suddenly fail us) describes an abrupt cessation of scientific utility.

Additionally, \"les fureurs\" (the furies, plural) is reduced to the singular \"the fury,\" simplifying the temporal aspect and slightly lessening the depicted intensity of war's impact.","The French \"Paix éternelle\" (eternal Peace) with its strong, absolute connotation is rendered as \"constant Peace,\" which implies uninterrupted rather than necessarily everlasting, slightly simplifying the intensity of the original term.","The stark French statement \"on ne connoît point l'Amour\" (one does not know Love at all) is softened and rephrased to \"without the delights of Love.\" This shifts from a fundamental lack of acquaintance with love to the absence of its pleasant aspects, simplifying the profundity of the deprivation.","The concise French statement \"& on s'ennuye\" (and one gets bored) is expanded into an explicit interpretation of consequence: \"which must render their Lives very irksom.\" This explicitation simplifies by removing the need for the reader to infer the impact, spelling out the effect and adding modal certainty.","The French \"la distribution du bonheur où des talens\" (the distribution of happiness or talents), suggesting a nuanced allocation, is simplified to the more stark and less detailed binary \"by making some happy, others miserable,\" omitting the specific mention of \"talens\" (talents).","The French \"elle l'aura sans doute pratiqué\" (she will undoubtedly have practiced it), using a future perfect tense to express strong likelihood about Nature's actions, is simplified to the more direct past tense \"Nature has done.\" This removes the nuanced temporal and epistemic stance.","The evocative French \"secret merveilleux\" (marvellous secret) is translated as \"admirable Art.\" Replacing \"secret\" with \"Art\" reduces the sense of mystery and wonder associated with Nature's methods, simplifying its characterization.","The concise and somewhat abstract French \"& de les égaler en même temps que les compensations\" (and of equalizing them at the same time as/through compensations) is expanded into a more explicit and elaborated clause in English, spelling out the mechanism of compensation and making the meaning more readily accessible."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Vous ay-je dubité assez de chimeres?</span></span> Vrayment, répondit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">il me semble que j'ay presentement moins de peine à attraper les differences de tous ces Mondes.</span></span> Mon imagination travaille sur le plan que vous mavez donné. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Je me represente comme je puis des Caracteres &amp; des Coûtumes extraordinaire pour les Habitans des Planetes</span></span>, &amp; je leur compose même des figures tout-à-fait bizarres. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Je ne vous les pourrois pas décrire, mais je voy pourtant quelque chose.</span></span> Pour ces figures-là, répliquay-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">je vous conseille d'en laisser le soin aux Songes que vous aurez cette nuit.</span></span> Nous verrons demain s'ils vous auront bien servie, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">&amp; s'ils vous auront appris comment sont faits les Habitants de quelque Planete</span></span>.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P039: Are you satisfi'd, said I, Madam, very gravely; have not I told you Chimeras in abundance?

The English translation simplifies this by unpacking it into a comparison followed by an explicit, significantly expanded explanatory clause detailing the critics' supposed ignorance and preferences. This restructuring, while adding text, reduces the density of the original's implicit reasoning.","The direct French quote, with its interjection \"Bon,\" and somewhat literal phrasing \"cela est tout fait comme des hommes\" (that is entirely made like humans), is simplified by being converted into smoother indirect speech. The phrase \"cela est tout fait comme des hommes\" is rendered as the more common English idiom \"our Pictures are nothing but Men and Women,\" clarifying \"cela\" and using more familiar phrasing, while the interjection is omitted.","The French \"de toutes ces Planetes\" (of all these planets) implies a specific and complete set known to the interlocutors. The English \"several Planets\" simplifies this by reducing the specificity and definitiveness, thereby lessening the cognitive burden on the reader to track or recall a comprehensive list of planets.","The French phrase \"on ne sait pas bien\" (one does not know well / one is not quite sure) includes the nuance of \"bien\" (well). The English translation \"'tis not known\" offers a more direct and absolute statement of ignorance, simplifying the original expression by omitting this qualifier.","The highly concise French phrase \"de dedans Venus\" (literally \"from inside Venus,\" implying \"from the perspective of Venus\" or \"on Venus\") is expanded to the more explicit \"to the Inhabitants of Venus.\" This clarification simplifies interpretation for the reader by making the implied observer and location explicit.","Similar to a previous instance, the concise French \"dedans Venus\" (from within Venus / on Venus), indicating perspective, is expanded to the more explicit \"to the Inhabitants of Venus.\" This clarification simplifies interpretation by making the implied observer and location explicit.","The French word \"grandeur\" (size, magnitude, greatness) is translated as \"bigness.\" \"Bigness,\" while standard in the period, is a generally more common and less formal term than \"grandeur,\" which can carry more abstract or formal connotations, thus simplifying the vocabulary."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: Vous m'affligez, dit la Marquise.

This reduces the richness of imagery and specific cultural references, making the description more general and less evocative.","The original \"Mere des Amours\" (Mother of Loves) is altered to \"Source of their Amours,\" and \"Etoile du Berger\" (Shepherd's Star) is changed to \"the lucky Star of their Intrigues.\" This simplification changes the specific pastoral and mythological connotations of the original French terms to more generalized concepts (\"Source\") or shifts the meaning (\"Intrigues\" instead of a pastoral star), arguably making them more readily understandable while losing some of the original nuance and imagery.","The adjective \"brillante\" (shining, brilliant) is translated as \"twinkling,\" a more common and less formal word, simplifying vocabulary. Additionally, the formal phrasing within \"qui ait un air galant\" is rendered with the colloquial contraction \"in 'em\" (in \"which have in 'em a certain Air of Gallantry\"), simplifying the register.","The concise French idiom \"doivent nien entendre la galanterie\" (idiomatically, \"must really understand gallantry\" or \"be experts in gallantry\") is expanded into a more descriptive and explicit phrase: \"are very soft, and have the Art to please extreamly well.\" This simplifies by breaking down an idiomatic concept of deep understanding into more common descriptive characteristics and actions, making the meaning more overt and reducing density, though increasing length.","The phrase \"une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur\" (a more vivid/lively light & more heat) is translated to \"a brighter Light, and a more enlivening Heat.\" The addition of \"enlivening\" to \"Heat\" makes an implied effect explicit, simplifying the reader's task of interpreting the impact of \"more heat.\" The translator also adds \"from its Influence,\" further explicating the source, reducing the density of the original.","The descriptive phrase \"un petit Peuple noir, brûlé du Soleil\" (a little black People, burnt by the Sun) is translated as \"a sort of little Sun-burnt Gentlemen.\" This simplifies by replacing the direct racial descriptor \"noir\" (black) with \"Sun-burnt\" (which is already conveyed by \"brûlé du Soleil\") and by changing the general term \"Peuple\" (People) to the more specific and socially elevated \"Gentlemen,\" altering the original's directness and potentially simplifying its impact.","The French \"plein d'esprit\" (full of wit/spirit) is translated as \"full of Life.\" \"Life\" is a more common and general term than \"esprit,\" which can mean wit, intellect, or spirit. This substitution simplifies the vocabulary by reducing the semantic richness of \"esprit.\"","The original phrase \"inventant tous les jours des Fêtes, des Danses, & des Tournois\" (inventing every day Festivals, Dances, & Tournaments) is expanded by adding the clause \"to entertain their Mistresses.\" This explicitation simplifies the text by directly stating the purpose of these activities, reducing the inferential load on the reader. Replacing \"Tournois\" with \"Masquerades\" also uses a more contemporary (for the translator) and perhaps more common term.","The French uses the conditional past \"n'auroient été... que\" (would have been... only), indicating a hypothetical comparison.

Additionally, the French euphemism \"les Petites Maisons\" (literally \"the little houses,\" for asylums) is replaced by \"Bethlem\" (Bedlam), a specific and notorious asylum. This change simplifies the language by making the reference more direct and concrete, reducing the indirectness of the euphemism.","The French phrase \"qu'ils ne font jamais de reflexion sur rien\" (literally, \"that they never make any reflection on anything\"), which uses the noun \"reflexion,\" is simplified to \"they never think.\" The verb \"think\" is more common and direct than the construction \"faire de reflexion\" (to make reflection/to reflect).","The French adjective \"prodigieuse\" (prodigious), a relatively strong and somewhat formal term indicating immense speed, is translated as \"wonderful.\" While \"wonderful\" in older English could mean 'causing wonder,' in this context it serves as a more common and potentially less intense adjective than \"prodigieuse,\" thereby simplifying the vocabulary.","The concise and evocative French \"apparemment ils soûpirent après la nuit\" (apparently they sigh for/long for the night) is rephrased into a more analytical and explicit statement: \"which, no doubt, must be much more grateful to 'em than the Day\". This simplifies by making the reason for their preference for night explicit (the night being more pleasant or \"grateful\"), rather than relying on the reader to infer it from the more poetic \"soûpirent après\" (sigh for/long for). This reduces figurative language for a more straightforward explanation.","The French impersonal construction \"il doit y en avoir beaucoup qui disparoissent\" (literally, \"there must be many of them that disappear\") presents a slightly more complex sentence structure. The translation simplifies this to a more direct active voice construction with a personal subject: \"they lose the sight of some of 'em entirely.\" This shift from an impersonal existential statement to a direct statement of experience simplifies the syntax.","The French \"celles qui me resteroient\" (those that would remain to me) uses a conditional mood, which is simplified in the English translation to the more direct indicative mood \"those I do see.\" Furthermore, the more specific and somewhat literary phrase \"d'une couleur plus effacée\" (of a more faded/erased/muted color) is simplified to the more common and general \"not so bright.\" Both changes contribute to simpler phrasing and vocabulary."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P059: Je ne suis pas si touchée, dit la Marquise, de cette perte-là que sont les Habitans de Mercure, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">que de l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de chaleur.</span></span> Je voudrois bien que nous les soulageassions un peu.

The English translation simplifies this to a more direct gerund phrase 'their being so extreamly incommoded,' enhancing readability by using a more common and less complex syntactic structure.","The French 'comme on dit qu'il en tombe' (as one says that some falls / as it is said that some falls) uses an impersonal construction that includes an element of reported speech or hearsay. The English translation 'such as are' simplifies this by replacing it with a direct descriptive phrase, removing the indirection of the reported speech and making the statement more straightforward.","The French adverb 'justement' (precisely, exactly) adds a specific emphasis to the timing ('precisely in the hottest seasons'). Its omission in the English translation 'during the hottest Seasons' reduces the informational density of the phrase and simplifies it by removing this layer of specific nuance.","The French phrase 'C'est que...' (It is that... / The fact is that...) is a common way to introduce an explanation, but it is less direct than the English 'The Reason is,'. The translation makes the logical function of the clause more explicit from the outset, simplifying the way the cause-and-effect relationship is presented to the reader.","The French construction 'Ce qu'il y a de sûr, c'est que...' (literally, 'That which there is of certain, it is that...') is a somewhat periphrastic way to state certainty. The English translation 'This is certain, that...' simplifies this to a more concise and direct idiomatic expression, improving readability.","The French 'ne sauroit faire vivre les Gens qu'où ils peuvent vivre' (Nature would not know how to make People live except where they can live / Nature can only make people live where they can live) employs a nuanced modal verb ('savoir' in the conditional, suggesting capacity or inherent limitation) combined with the restrictive 'ne...que' (only) structure. The English translation 'Nature produces no Animal, but in places where they may live' uses a more standard and structurally simpler phrasing ('produces no... but...') to convey the restriction, making the statement more direct and easier to parse."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P061: Aprés Mercure vous savez qu'on trouve le Soleil.

The translation recasts this into a conditional structure ('if we judge...') followed by the consequence of that judgment being flawed ('we are mistaken') and an explanation ('for...'). This restructuring simplifies the argumentative flow by making the logical steps more explicit and arguably easier for the reader to follow.","The French parenthetical phrase 'pour ainsi dire' (so to speak), present in the source clause, is omitted in the English translation. This omission simplifies the sentence by removing a qualifying hedge, making the statement more direct and reducing its stylistic nuance.","The French 'revient à la rencontre de' (literally 'returns to meet' or 'is reflected by'), a somewhat periphrastic description of light's interaction with solid objects, is translated to 'is intercepted by.' The verb 'intercepted' is more common and direct, simplifying the original's more descriptive phrasing and reducing its phrasing length.","The metaphorical French 'tissus' (fabrics, weaves) is translated to the more common and less figurative 'Mixture.' This lexical choice simplifies the original's rich imagery by opting for a more straightforward term, reducing stylistic complexity.","The French impersonal construction 'On est bien embarrassé à le dire' (One is very perplexed/embarrassed to say it), which conveys a sense of human difficulty and uncertainty, is simplified to the more direct and abstract statement 'is all the difficulty:'. This rephrasing streamlines the expression by removing the human subject and the verb of speech, focusing instead on the nature of the problem itself.","The concise French reflexive and pronominal verb construction 'on s'en desabusa' (one was disabused of it / one realized one's error) is translated with the more explicit and analytical phrase 'the Error of this Opinion was found out.' This unpacks the meaning, simplifying the idiomatic French potentially for enhanced clarity for an English reader.","The original French uses a single, long complex sentence beginning with 'Comme' (As/Since) and featuring several subordinate 'que' clauses detailing the reasons that lead to the main concluding verb 'on jugea aussi-tôt' (one immediately judged). The English translation breaks this complex syntactic structure. It introduces the first reason with 'as,' then uses a colon, followed by a new main clause ('The learned part of the World were full...') and a consecutive 'that' clause ('that they believ'd...'). This restructuring simplifies the original's dense, multi-clausal sentence into more digestible segments, enhancing readability by reducing syntactic complexity.","The French term 'tout le Monde Philosophe' (the whole Philosophical World), referring to the intellectual or scientific community of the time, is translated to 'The learned part of the World.' This phrasing uses more common vocabulary and a less specialized term, simplifying it for a general English reader.","The initial French temporal adverb 'Déja' (Already) is omitted in the English translation of the sentence. This omission simplifies the text by removing a nuance that emphasized the promptness or existing state of the scholars' actions, reducing the density of information.","The French 'pretendües Planetes' (alleged/supposed Planets) carries a nuance of skepticism or reflects their (incorrect) identification as planets. The translation 'new discover'd Planets' removes this critical nuance, simplifying the description by presenting them more straightforwardly as if they were confirmed new planets, thereby losing some of the original's subtle commentary on the misinterpretation.","The elaborate French phrase 'à qui seroit demeuré le maître des taches pour les nommer comme il eût voulu...' (describing a potential dispute over who would have remained the master of the spots to name them as he would have wished) is drastically simplified to the English 'to whom they shou'd belong.' This reduces the length and complexity of the original phrasing, omitting the specific details about the power of naming and the ironic tone concerning 'mastery,' making the concept more general and easier to grasp."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

The English simplifies this by shifting to an active voice: 'and by the force of its Motion, throws upon the Surface its Scum and Dross'. This makes the action more direct and arguably simplifies the grammatical structure, with 'Scum and Dross' being a more concrete, though elaborated, depiction of the impurities on the surface.","The French pronominal verb 'Elles s'y consument' (They are consumed there / They consume themselves there) is translated into a simpler active voice construction 'as those consume'. Similarly, the impersonal pronominal passive 'il s'en produit d'autres' (others of them are produced) is simplified to 'new ones are produc'd,' which uses a more common subject ('new ones') and a standard passive voice, making it more straightforward for an English reader.","The French phrase 'D'autres disent' (Others say) is simplified to the more general pronoun 'They say.' While other parts of the sentence involve elaborations, this initial change in attribution uses a less specific subject, which is a form of simplification.","The French impersonal construction 's'il faut se défier des Lunettes même' (if one must mistrust the telescopes themselves), expressing an obligation, is transformed within the question. The English renders this part as 'when these very Glasses... deceive us,' shifting to a more direct phrasing where the 'Glasses' become the active agent of deception. This simplifies the expression of the problem by moving from an impersonal necessity to an active verb.","The French word 'pitoyable' (pitiful, lamentable, deplorable) is translated as 'hard.' 'Hard,' in this context meaning regrettable or difficult to accept, is a more common and less emotionally intense word than 'pitoyable.' This lexical choice simplifies the vocabulary and reduces the original's stronger emotional connotation.","The translation simplifies the French sentence in two main ways: first, by omitting the intensifier 'extremément' (extremely) from 'extrêmement facile' (extremely easy), rendering it merely as 'easie,' which reduces the descriptive force. Second, the phrase 'justement dans ce lieu-là, il n'y a personne' (and precisely in that place, there is no one) is altered to 'and that that place alone shou'd be uninhabitable?'. This changes a direct statement of fact (absence of people) into a statement about the inherent quality of the place, simplifying the implication.","The concise French rhetorical question 'Le Soleil n'efface-t-il pas tout?' (Does the Sun not erase/blot out everything?) is rephrased as a declarative statement: 'the brightness of the Sun wou'd render all things else invisible;'. This change simplifies by removing the rhetorical device and providing a more direct explanation of the phenomenon, making the meaning more explicit and less reliant on the reader's interpretation of rhetoric.","The translation simplifies the French sentence by altering its structure and lexical choices. The emphatic French cleft sentence 'Ce seroient ses Habitans qui...' (It would be its Inhabitants who...) is replaced by a more standard conditional structure: 'and if there were Inhabitants in the Sun, they...'. Additionally, the phrase 'seroient bien fondez à se croire' (would be well-founded/justified in believing) is rendered as 'wou'd be apt to believe.' 'Apt to' suggests a tendency, which is a more common term and a weaker, thus simpler, expression of justification than 'bien fondez à.'"]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P063: J'avoüe que je m'étois trompé, répondis-je, je ne songeois qu'à la situation où est le Soleil,&amp; non à l'effet de sa lumiere; mais vous qui me redressez si à propos, vous voulez bien que je vous dise que vous vous êtes trompée aussi; les Habitans du Soleil ne le verroient seulement pas.

So that, once for all, I conclude, the Sun cannot be inhabited; and if you please, Madam, we will continue our Journey to the other Worlds: We are now come to the Centre, which is the lowest Point in all Circular Figures; and therefore must return back again, and go upwards. In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited.</p> <p>P049: The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and his Inhabitants see the Sun neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or Guards: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light.

This is an explicit attempt to simplify a key scientific term by offering a more familiar synonym to the English reader.","The somewhat formal French expression 'vous ne parleriez pas comme vous faites' (you would not speak as you do) is translated using the more colloquial and common English idiom 'you wou'd not talk at that rate,' simplifying the register.","The Marquise's exclamation 'Achevez de me rendre folle... & donnons-nous aux Tourbillons' (Finish making me mad/crazy... and let's give ourselves to the Tourbillons), expressing intense eagerness, is simplified. 'Achevez de me rendre folle' becomes a more direct request 'make haste therefore to satisfie me,' and the figurative 'donnons-nous aux Tourbillons' becomes the literal 'but let me understand these Whirling's.' This reduces metaphorical language for clearer, more straightforward expression.","The French explicative structure 'Ce qu'on appelle un Tourbillon, c'est...' (That which one calls a Tourbillon, it is...) is simplified to the more direct English sentence structure 'a Tourbillion is...'. This enhances readability by reducing the complexity of the introductory phrase.","The abstract 'Tourbillon de vent' (whirlwind of air) is simplified by the translator adding concrete, familiar English examples: 'call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain.' This makes the concept more accessible by relating it to known phenomena.","The French phrase 'd'une agitation prodigieuse' (of a prodigious agitation/movement), describing celestial matter, is simplified. 'Agitation' is rendered as 'swift,' a more common and readily understandable adjective in this context, reducing lexical complexity.","The general French phrase 'les fait tourner toutes en un même sens' (makes them all turn in the same direction) is made more concrete and explicit by the addition of 'from East to West.' This provides specific directional information, simplifying the reader's task of visualizing the described celestial motion.","The somewhat formal and idiomatic French 'elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle- même' (it still could not do less than turn on itself) is simplified to the more direct phrasing 'she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that,' reducing stylistic complexity.","The idiomatic French 'ne laisse pas de tourner' (does not fail to turn / nevertheless turns) is simplified to the more straightforward 'yet every one of them turns,' removing the slightly more complex litotic construction for directness.","The French litotes '& le tout ensemble... n'en tourne pas moins autour du Soleil' (and the whole ensemble... turns no less/nevertheless still turns around the Sun) is simplified into the more direct negative statement 'but yet that does not hinder both... to turn round...,' making the meaning more explicit and less reliant on understanding the rhetorical figure.","The French reflexive causative 'nous nous fîmes suivre par la Lune' (we made ourselves be followed by the Moon / we got the Moon to follow us) is simplified to a direct active construction 'the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self,' reducing syntactic complexity and making the agent clearer.","The philosopher's rhetorical question to the Marquise, 'croyez-vous que nous l'eussions êté...?' (do you believe that we would have been so...?), is simplified into an assertive statement incorporating her perspective: 'you may easily believe...'. This makes the sentence mood more direct and less engaging of the interlocutor's direct response.","The clause 'il nous auroit engloutis sans peine dans son Tourbillon' (he would have swallowed us without difficulty in his Tourbillon) is omitted. This reduces textual density and removes a vivid image. The subsequent phrase 'tant il est vray que le seul hazard de la situation décide souvent de toute la fortune qu'on doit avoir' is condensed to 'So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune,' omitting 'souvent' (often) and simplifying 'le seul hazard' to 'Chance,' and 'toute la fortune qu'on doit avoir' to 'our Fortune'. This simplification reduces length and lexical density.","The idiomatic French 'que nous ne fassions la folie de nous approcher' (that we might not do the folly of approaching/be foolish enough to approach) is simplified to the more colloquial and less dramatic 'we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards'. Additionally, 'entreprenante' (enterprising, bold) describing Jupiter is simplified to 'dangerous,' a more common adjective in the context of potential cosmic threat.","The strong, active concept expressed in French 'peut être irions- nous soumettre à notre domination Mercure & Venus' (perhaps we would go and submit Mercury & Venus to our domination) is significantly simplified and weakened to the passive and less impactful 'for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury'. This reduces the complexity of the described action and its geopolitical implications.","The impersonal French constructions using 'Qu'on mette' (Let one put) and 'Qu'on y mette' (Let one put there) are simplified to more direct forms targeting the reader: 'if you throw' and 'Throw in'. The word 'Corps' (Body) is simplified to the more common 'thing'. The verb 'rencontre' (meets) in 'tombera jusqu'à ce qu'il rencontre l'eau' is part of a clause simplified to '’twill fall upon the Water, and swim'.","The French construction 'deux Corps inégalement pesants se mettent naturellement à deux places differentes' (two unequally heavy Bodies naturally place themselves in two different places) which focuses on the bodies' agency, is restructured. The English 'this Vessel... rests naturally in two different Positions' shifts the focus. Furthermore, the concise 'jamais l'un ne montera, ny l'autre ne descendra' (and never will one rise, nor the other descend) is simplified by making the subjects explicit: 'so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend,' enhancing readability.","The impersonal French 'Qu'on mette encore d'autres liqueurs... & qu'on y plonge d'autres corps' (Let one put again other liquids... and let one plunge other bodies into them) is simplified by using a conditional with direct address 'If you add other Liquors...' and the more common verb 'throw' instead of 'plonge' (plunge): 'and throw as many Bodies into 'em'.","The French 'à differentes couches' (has different layers) becomes 'is compos'd of different Coats'. More significantly, the abstract description of layers is simplified by the translator's addition of a concrete analogy, 'like an Onion,' which is not present in the source. This makes the concept more accessible and easier to visualize.","The French 'la couche qui a précisément la force necessaire pour la soûtenir' (the layer which has precisely the necessary force to support it) is expanded to 'that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it.' The addition of 'proportionable to its weight' simplifies the concept by explicitly stating the reason for the necessary force. Similarly, 'qui luy fait équilibre' (which makes equilibrium with it/balances it) is rendered more explicitly as 'keeping it in an equal Balance.'"]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P067: Je conçois, dit la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">que ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Plût à Dieu qu'il y eût quelque chose de pareil qui les reglât parmi nous, &amp; qui fixât les Gens dans les places qui leur sont naturellement convenables.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Me voilà fort en repos du côté de Jupiter.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Je suis bien aise qu'il nous laisse dans notre petit tourbillon avec notre Lune unique.

The translation simplifies by restructuring it into a passive-voice clause ('how these...are regulated') and adding the explanatory phrase 'according to their several degrees.' This unpacks the dense French statement, making the underlying mechanism more explicit and arguably easier for a non-scientific reader to understand.","The translator simplifies a complex French sentence structure. The original features 'quelque chose de pareil' (something similar) modified by two coordinated relative clauses ('qui les reglât...' and '& qui fixât...'). The translation uses a more concrete noun ('Order') and replaces the two clauses with a single, more direct infinitive phrase ('to confine...'). Vocabulary is also simplified: 'Gens' (People) and 'places qui leur sont naturellement convenables' (places naturally suitable for them) become 'every Man' and 'the Station that is fit for him,' using more common and specific terms.","The French phrase 'Me voilà fort en repos du côté de Jupiter' (Here I am, very much at ease regarding Jupiter) describes a nuanced state of being. The translation simplifies this by interpreting the *reason* for her ease—the cessation of a presumed prior fear—and states it more directly as 'I am now no longer in fear.' This uses more common emotional vocabulary and makes an implicit feeling more explicit.","The translation simplifies by condensing two nearly identical consecutive sentences from the source into a single sentence, reducing textual repetition and density. The phrase 'Je suis bien aise' (I am very glad) is rendered as 'I am satisfy'd,' a slightly less emphatic and perhaps more common term. The detail 'avec notre Lune unique' (with our unique Moon), present in both source sentences, is omitted from this specific consolidated clause in the target. The addition of 'Whirling' as an explanatory gloss for 'Tourbillion' also simplifies by clarifying a potentially unfamiliar term.","The French 'Je suis d'humeur à me borner aisément' (I am of a temperament to limit myself easily/be easily content) is an idiomatic and somewhat complex construction. The translation simplifies this significantly to the more direct and common English phrase 'I am easily pleas'd.' Furthermore, the pronominal phrase 'les quatre qu'il a' (the four that he has) is made more explicit in the translation as 'his four Moons,' clarifying the referent and simplifying comprehension."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P068: Vous auriez tort de les luy envier, repris-je, il n'en a point plus qu'il ne luy en faut.

The English translation breaks this down into a more linear sequence: 'his Nights are but four Hours long; and being so short,'. Additionally, the somewhat formal 'ne paroîtroient pas si necessaires' (would not seem so necessary) is rendered as the more common and accessible 'one wou'd think he had no great need'. Lastly, the impersonal 'mail il y a autre chose à considerer' (but there is something else to consider) is made more direct and conversational with 'But you must consider,'.","The French text introduces the topic with a short, detached phrase 'Les années.' (The years.), which is omitted in the English translation. This omission simplifies the rhetorical structure by creating a more continuous sentence flow. Furthermore, the French 'en valent douze des nôtre' (are worth/equivalent to twelve of ours) is simplified to the more common English phrasing 'is twelve of ours'.","The French uses an emphatic cleft construction 'aussi est ce principalement pour elles que...' (and so it is principally for them that...). The English translation opts for a more standard, direct sentence structure: 'and I believe these four Moons were chiefly created for that reason:', thereby simplifying the original's more complex emphatic phrasing.","The French 'elles sont toutes à leur Midy' (they are all at their Meridian/Midday) offers a precise astronomical description of the moons' positions. The English translation changes this to 'sometimes they see 'em over their Heads,' shifting to an observer's subjective viewpoint and using a more general, less technical phrase ('over their Heads' instead of 'at their Meridian'). This simplifies the concept by making it more readily accessible and experiential for the reader.","The French 'ce jeu perpétuel d'Eclipses' (this perpetual game of Eclipses) employs a metaphor ('jeu'/game). The English translation 'their constant Eclipsing' renders this more literally and directly, simplifying the figurative language. Additionally, the detailed explanatory clause 'qu'elles ne s'éclipsent les unes les autres, ou qu'elles n'éclipsent le Soleil' (that they do not eclipse each other, or that they do not eclipse the Sun) is significantly condensed to 'without one of the two', simplifying the sentence by reducing the explicitness of the dependent clause.","The French text connects a conditional clause starting with 'si les Habitans...' (if the Inhabitants...) and its consequence ('ils voyent aussi la Lune...') with a simple conjunction '&' (and), implying the logical sequence. The English translation makes this logical connection more explicit and prominent by using the structure 'So that if... it must follow, that...'.

Furthermore, the general 'une autre' (another [planet]) is made more explicit as 'the Inhabitants of a greater [planet],' enhancing readability by clarifying the reference, even if it increases length.","The French phrase 'auroient bien plus de sujet de craindre' (would have much more reason to fear) is simplified to 'have more Reason to fear.' The omission of the intensifier 'bien' (much) reduces the emphasis slightly, simplifying the expression. Also, the French 'En verité' (In truth/Indeed) is rendered as the less assertive 'And if it be true,' which can be a form of simplification by reducing the force of the statement for a smoother, more conversational tone.","Simplification is achieved through several changes: the phrase 'là aussi' (there also) is omitted, making the sentence more direct; 'assurée' (assured) is replaced by the more common 'told me'; 'exempts' (exempt) is replaced by the more common phrasal verb 'free from'; and the emphatic adverb 'bien' (indeed/well) is omitted before 'remplacer.' These alterations use more common vocabulary and reduce textual density, enhancing readability.","The emphatic French phrase 'Il le faut de necessité absolue' (It is necessary of absolute necessity) is simplified. The English translation uses the more common construction 'It must be so' and replaces the somewhat redundant emphatic noun phrase 'de necessité absolue' with the single adverb 'infallibly,' streamlining the sentence structure for easier comprehension.","The French sentence is simplified by translating the somewhat literary/formal idiom 'n'avoit garde de craindre' (was careful not to fear / had no inclination to fear) to the more common English idiom 'was far from fearing.' Additionally, the concluding clause 'il passoit sa vie avec elles' (he spent his life with them) is omitted, which reduces the length and density of the text, simplifying the overall statement.","The French text uses a rhetorical question, 'Mais croiriez-vous bien ce qu'il craignoit en leur place?' (But would you indeed believe what he feared in their place?), to engage the reader. The English translation simplifies this by converting it into a direct declarative statement, 'but instead of that, he fear'd,'. This change simplifies the sentence structure and narrative style by removing the interactive interrogative form, making the discourse more direct.","Simplification occurs through vocabulary choice: the somewhat more formal French 'logis' (dwelling, lodging) is translated to the more common 'House.' Additionally, the specific noun 'une Vieille' (an Old Woman) is rendered less specifically as the adjective 'old' (referring to the person encountered), reducing detail which can be a form of simplification. The parenthetical 'as he went out of his House in the Morning,' while an expansion, serves to clarify 'en sortant de son logis,' enhancing readability."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit- elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">après que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la</span></span>, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Nous ne leur ferons pas de quartier, ils subiront la Loy commune, &amp; donneront dans quelque autre erreur</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">mais comme je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner</span></span>, éclaircissez-moy, je vous prie, une autre difficulté qui m'occupe depuis quelques moments.

The English translation 'was not free from the Fear of Eclipses for nothing' uses the common idiom 'not for nothing' (meaning for a significant reason), simplifying the more precise legalistic term 'impunément' and restructuring the complex action-consequence dynamic into a state-reason dynamic, which is more common in English.","The French text describes future consequences for the Moon's inhabitants using future indicative verbs ('ils subiront,' 'ils donneront,' meaning 'they will undergo,' 'they will fall into'). The English translation converts this into a series of hortatory statements where the speaker actively imposes these consequences ('force 'em to submit,' 'oblige 'em to yield'). This structural shift simplifies the sentence's modality by making the Marquise's call for action more direct and less descriptive of a future state.","The somewhat formal and idiomatic French 'je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner' (I don't pride myself on being able to guess it / I don't claim to be able to guess it) is translated into the more straightforward and common English phrase 'I will not trouble my self to guess'. This simplifies the vocabulary and the more complex nuance of the original expression.","The French uses a complex impersonal subjunctive construction 'Il faudroit qu'il vît' (It would be necessary that he/it see / He/it would have to see), where 'il' ambiguously refers to Jupiter or a Jovian. The translation simplifies this by making the subject explicit ('the Inhabitants of Iupiter must see') and using a more direct modal verb ('must see'), enhancing clarity and readability.","The French 'en parle' (speaks of it) is a general statement about the journal's action. The English translation 'they set it down in' simplifies this by describing a more concrete and specific action (recording or writing it down), making the event more direct and less abstract for the reader.","The French repeatedly uses the impersonal pronoun 'On' (one/they). The translation simplifies this structure by using an explicit subject ('These Astronomers,' 'they'), making the sentences more direct and easier to follow. Additionally, the phrase 'ce n'est point une vision' (it is not a vision) is rendered as 'it is no Fancy but a real thing'; the addition of 'but a real thing' makes the implication of 'not a vision' more explicit, reducing the inferential step for the reader.","The French phrase '& la veüe à peine peut-elle encore l'attraper' (and sight can hardly still catch it) is somewhat figurative and employs a more complex stylistic inversion. The English translation 'tho 'tis so little, 'tis hardly discoverable' simplifies this by using a more direct, conventional sentence structure and less figurative language, making the meaning more immediately accessible."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P074: Si ce n'êtoit, dit la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">qu'il n'est point trop agreable de savoir qu'on ne nous peut découvrir de dedans Jupiter qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">je me représenterois avec plaisir ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, comme les nôtres le sont vers luy,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">&amp; cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considèrent &amp; demandent l'une de l'autre,</span></span> Quel monde est-ce là?

The English translation adds \"in that Planet,\" specifying what this remarkable thing pertains to. This explication reduces the reader's need for inference, simplifying comprehension by increasing explicitness.","The general French term \"des Pays\" (countries/lands/regions) is translated as \"Climates in that World.\" This lexical choice narrows the meaning to a concept more directly relevant to planetary science (\"Climates\") and makes the location explicit (\"in that World\"), simplifying by reducing the generality of the original term and enhancing contextual relevance for the popular science reader. The provided target text itself includes an editorial note \"[translates \\\"des Pays\\\"]\" immediately after this phrase, highlighting this lexical shift.","The translation changes \"inventé\" (invented) to \"intended,\" arguably using a more conventional term for Nature's purpose in this context. More clearly, \"si affreuses\" (so dreadful/frightful) is expanded to \"so long and dreadful.\" This latter addition explicitly links the dreadfulness of the nights to their previously mentioned length, simplifying comprehension by reiterating information and clarifying the cause of the dreadfulness.","The original French uses a single, long participial clause to describe both the ring's position and its reflective function. The translation simplifies this complex structure by effectively splitting it into two main ideas, with the reflective action becoming a new sentence (\"It reflects...\"). Furthermore, the concise French phrase \"refléchit perpetuellement la lumiere du Soleil dans les lieux qui ne le voyent point\" (perpetually reflects the sunlight in the places that do not see it [the Sun]) is significantly expanded and explicated in the English. The target specifies the beneficiaries (\"upon the Inhabitants of Saturn\") and elaborates on their situation (\"who have the Misfortune to live in that Climate, that is, so long a time depriv'd of the influence of his Beams\"). This structural simplification through sentence splitting, combined with extensive elaboration, makes the original denser statement more accessible by breaking it down and spelling out its implications for the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P078: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">En verité</span></span>, dit la Marquise, de l'air d'une personne qui rentroit en elle-même avec étonnement, tout cela est d'un grand ordre; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">il paroît bien que la Nature a eu en veüe les besoins de quelques Etres vivans</span></span>, &amp; que la distribution des Lunes n'a pas êté faite au hazard. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Il n'en est tombé en partage qu'aux Planetes éloignées du Soleil</span></span>, à la Terre, à Jupiter, à Saturne, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">car ce n'êtoit pas la peine d'en donner à Vénus &amp; à Mercure</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">qui ne reçoivent que trop de lumiere</span></span>, dont les nuits sont fort courtes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">&amp; qui les comptent apparemment pour de plus grands bienfaits de la Nature que leurs jours mêmes.</span></span> Mais attendez, il me semble que Mars, qui est encore plus éloigné du Soleil que la Terre, n'a point de Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">On ne peut pas vous le dissimuler</span></span>, répondis-je, il n'en a point, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; il faut qu'il ait pour ses nuits des ressources que nous ne savons pas.</span></span> Vous avez veu <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">des Phosphores, de ces matières liquides ou seches</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">qui en recevant la lumiere du Soleil, s'en imbibent, &amp; s'en penetrent</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">&amp; ensuite jettent un assez grand éclat dans l'obscurité.</span></span> Peut-être Mars a-t-il de grands Rochers fort élevés, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">qui sont des Phosphores naturels</span></span>, &amp; qui prennent pendant le jour une provision de lumière qu'ils rendent pendant la nuit. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Vous ne sauriez rier que ce ne fût un Spectacle assez agreable</span></span>, de voir tous ces Rochers <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">s'allumer de toutes parts dé que le Soleil seroit couché</span></span>, &amp; faire sans aucun art des illuminations magnifiques.

The translation adds 'as well to Mars' and 'absolutely necessary,' making the Marquise's underlying concern and the strength of her conviction clearer and more direct.","The French active construction with a causative nuance, 'venu faire une exception' (come to make an exception/become an exception), is simplified into a more direct passive construction 'might not have been so disagreeably excepted,' reducing structural complexity.","The complex French modal construction 'il faudroit bien que vous vous accoûtumassiez' (it would indeed be necessary that you accustom yourself) is simplified to the more direct 'you must accustom your self,' reducing the formal complexity of the obligation.","The dense French verbal phrase 'si on desespere d'en pouvoir venir à bout' (if one despairs of being able to overcome it/succeed with it) is simplified by using a noun phrase and infinitive, 'if there be no hopes to overcome the difficulty,' making the structure less convoluted.","The original declarative statement 'Nous serions bien étonnez' (We would be very astonished) is simplified by reframing it as a more direct, engaging question 'And tell me if it wou'd not be strangely surprizing'. Additionally, 'd'un bout à l'autre de l'Horizon' (from one end of the horizon to the other) is simplified by the more pictorially explicit 'going from opposite Points of the Horizon,' aiding visualization.","The French phrase 'à en envoyer par tout,' where 'en' is an anaphoric pronoun referring to inhabitants, is simplified by making the object explicit: 'to put Inhabitants every where.' This reduces the reader's cognitive load by not requiring them to track the referent of 'en'.","The concise French 'de les peupler' (to populate them) is simplified through explicitation. The translator adds the clause 'for they must have Inhabitants,' which clearly states the direct implication of 'populating them,' making the meaning more accessible.","The specific detail 'trois échappées' (three [that had] escaped) from the French source is simplified by omitting the number 'trois' (three). The English translation 'had only escaped' reduces the information load presented to the reader.","The general idiomatic French phrase 'Quoy qu'il en soit' (Be that as it may / Whatever the case may be) is simplified by the more explicit English 'and yet whatever is the Cause.' This interprets 'il en' as referring to the cause of the previously discussed phenomena, making the connection clearer for the reader.","The rhetorical question 'mais quelle lumiere!' (but what light!), which implies its poor quality, is simplified by making this implication explicit. The translator adds 'Sure a very feeble one,' directly stating the assessment of the light's quality.","The French verb 'expirer de chaud' (to expire from heat) is simplified by using the more common and vivid idiomatic English expression 'melt away with heat.' Additionally, the French pronoun 'les' (them) is made explicit as 'some of the Inhabitants of Saturn,' clarifying the referent and reducing ambiguity.","The figurative French expression 'qui me gele' (that freezes me) is simplified to the more common and less intense English phrase 'that makes me shiver with cold,' rendering the Marquise's physical reaction in more everyday terms.","The French phrase 'en me parlant de Mercure' (by speaking to me of Mercury) is simplified through explicitation to 'with the descriptions you gave me of Mercury.' This clarifies the means by which the philosopher had previously 'warmed' the Marquise, making the connection more direct.","The French impersonal construction 'on est bien sage' (one is very wise / people are very wise) is simplified by making the subject explicit ('the Inhabitants of Saturn'). Furthermore, changing 'est' (is) to 'must be' makes the deductive nature of the Marquise's statement (signaled by 'Ainsi') more explicit within the main verb.","The French impersonal pronoun 'on' (one/people), used twice, is consistently simplified by being replaced with the explicit 'the People of Saturn' and the anaphoric pronoun 'they.' This repetition of a clear subject makes the sentence easier to follow.","The French construction 'Ce sont Gens qui...' (These are People who...) is simplified to a more direct attributive statement 'they know not...'. This changes a somewhat formal definitional structure into a direct characterization of the previously mentioned 'People of Saturn.'","The reference to 'Caton d'Utique' is changed to 'the grave Cato the Censor.' This alteration could be a form of simplification if 'Cato the Censor' was a more readily recognized figure of 'gravity' for the contemporary English audience, thereby making the intended contrast with 'wild and youthful' (for 'badin & folâtre') more immediately striking. The addition of 'for their Conversation' further explicates the context of their judgment, simplifying the implicature."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P082: Il me vient une pensée, dit-elle.

The English translation simplifies by explicitly stating \"we have a mixture of both\" upfront, making the subsequent examples of 'airy' and 'insipid' people easier to contextualize as parts of this mixture, thus improving clarity and flow.","The abstract French phrase 'nous participons des extrémitez' (we partake of the extremities) is simplified by explication to 'we participate so of the Qualities of both these Extremes'. Adding 'so' and 'the Qualities of both' makes the nature of this participation more concrete and easier to understand.","The potentially technical or ambiguous term 'especes' (species) is simplified by translating it to the more common and contextually clearer phrase 'several kinds of People.' This uses more common vocabulary and clarifies that 'species' refers to types of intelligent beings, enhancing readability for a general audience.","The concise French 'tous les autres Mondes en abregé' (all the other worlds in abridged form) is simplified by expansion to 'an abridgement of all that can be seen in the other Worlds.' This explication clarifies what 'en abregé' means in this specific context, making the abstract idea more concrete and digestible.","The original French sentence structure, which presents 'une commodité fort réelle' and then defines it using a relative clause ('qu'a nôtre Monde') and a 'c'est que...' construction, is simplified in English. The translation uses a more direct Subject-Verb-Object structure ('Our World has...'), which streamlines the sentence and improves readability by presenting the information more straightforwardly.","The French phrase 'moi je veux luy rendre grâce' (I, I want to give thanks to her/it) includes an explicit expression of volition with 'veux' (want). The English translation 'for my Part, I thank her' simplifies this by omitting the modal of volition, making the statement of gratitude more direct and less mediated by intent.","The French uses a presentational construction 'Voila...' (There are...) followed by a clause 'que ceux que vous tirez de...' (than those that you draw from...). This is simplified in the English translation to a more direct and active statement, 'You have abundance of other Reasons...', which uses a simpler Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure, enhancing directness and readability.","The French presents two distinct clauses: a statement ('est assez petite') and a consecutive moral injunction ('il n'en faut rien perdre'). The English translation simplifies this by integrating the second idea into the first, forming a single, more concise clause: 'is too little to lose any part of it.' This structural simplification improves flow and reduces textual density.","The French 'un goût qui les mette à profit' (a taste that puts them to profit/makes good use of them) is relatively abstract. The English simplifies this by explication: 'as to turn all to our Advantage and Profit.' This expansion clarifies the practical outcome of 'un goût,' making the benefit more explicit and easier for the reader to grasp, thus enhancing readability.","The straightforward French 'J'ai des Etoiles fixes' (I have fixed stars) is rendered as 'I have the fixed Stars prepared for you.' The addition of 'prepared for you' simplifies the delivery by making it more personal and directly engaging in the conversational context. Furthermore, changing 'vu' (seen) to 'heard' simplifies by aligning the sensory verb with the established context of learning through discourse, making the reference clearer."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">CINQUIEME SOIR.

Can they be inhabited as the Planets are, said she to me? or are they not inhabited? what shall we make of 'em? If you wou'd take the Pains, you cou'd not fail to guess, said I, Madam, the fixt Stars cannot be less distant from the Earth, than fifty Millions of Leagues; nay, some Astronomers make the distance yet greater; that between the Sun and the remotest Planet is nothing if compared to the distance between the Sun or Earth, and the fix'd Stars; we do not trouble our selves to number 'em, their Lustre as you see is both clear and bright. If the fix'd Stars, receive their Light from the Sun, it must certainly be very weak and faint before it comes to 'em, having passed through a hundred and fifty Millions of Miles of the Celestial Substance, I spoke of before: Then consider, the fix'd Stars are oblig'd, to reflect this borrow'd Light upon us at the same distance, which Is every fixt Star the Center of a Tourbillion; and it may be full as big as our Sun? Is it possible, that all this Immense space, wherein our Sun and Planets have their Revolution, is nothing but an inconsiderable part of the Universe? And that every fix'd Star must comprehend and govern an equal space with our Sun? This confounds, afflicts, and frightens me. And for my part, said I, it pleases and rejoices me; when I believ'd the Universe to be nothing, but this great Azure Vault of the Heavens, wherein the Stars were placed, as it were so many golden Nails or Studs, the Universe seem'd to me too little and strait; I fansied my self to be confin'd and oppress'd: But now when I am perswaded, that this Azure Vault has a greater depth and a vaster Extent, and that 'tis divided into a thousand and a thousand different Tourbillions or Whirlings, I imagine I am at more Liberty, and breath a freer Air; and the Universe appears to me to be infinitely more Magnificent. Nature has spared nothing in her Production, and hath profusely bestow'd her Treasures upon a glorious Work worthy of her: You can represent nothing so august to your self, as this prodigious Number of Tourbillions, whose Center is possess'd by a Sun, that makes the Planets turn round him. The Inhabitants of the Planets of any of these infinite Tourbillions, see from all sides the enlightned Center of the Tourbillion with which they are inviron'd; but cannot discover the Planets of another, who enjoy but a faint Light, borrow'd from their own Sun, which it does not dart further than its own Sphere or Activity. You show me, said the Marquiese, so vast a Prospect, that my sight cannot reach to the end of it: I see clearly the Inhabitants of our World; and you have plainly presented to my Reason the Inhabitants of the Moon, and other Planets of our Tourbillion or Whirling: After this you tell me of the Inhabitants of the Planets of all the other Tourbillions. I confess, they seem to me to be sunk into so boundless a depth, that whatever force I put upon my Fancy, I cannot comprehend 'em; and indeed you have annihilated 'em by the Expressions you made use of in speaking of 'em and their Inhabitants.

As for me who know 'em, I am very sorry I can draw no advantage from that Knowledge, which can cure nothing but Ambition and Disquiet, and none of these Diseases trouble me. I confess a kind of Weakness in Love, a kind of frailty for what is delicate and handsom, this is my Distemper, wherein the Tourbillions are not concern'd at all.

Can they be inhabited as the Planets are, said she to me? or are they not inhabited? what shall we make of 'em? If you wou'd take the Pains, you cou'd not fail to guess, said I, Madam, the fixt Stars cannot be less distant from the Earth, than fifty Millions of Leagues; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">nay, some Astronomers make the distance yet greater;</span></span> that between the Sun and the remotest Planet is nothing if compared to the distance between the Sun or Earth, and the fix'd Stars; we do not trouble our selves to number 'em, their Lustre as you see is both clear and bright. If the fix'd Stars, receive their Light from the Sun, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">it must certainly be very weak and faint before it comes to 'em, having passed through a hundred and fifty Millions of Miles of the Celestial Substance, I spoke of before: Then consider, the fix'd Stars are oblig'd, to reflect this borrow'd Light upon us at the same distance,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">which Is every fixt Star the Center of a Tourbillion;</span></span> and it may be full as big as our Sun? Is it possible, that all this Immense space, wherein our Sun and Planets have their Revolution, is nothing but an inconsiderable part of the Universe? And that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">every fix'd Star must comprehend and govern an equal space with our Sun? This confounds, afflicts, and frightens me</span></span></span></span>. And for my part, said I, it pleases and rejoices me; when I believ'd the Universe to be nothing, but this great Azure Vault of the Heavens, wherein the Stars were placed, as it were so many golden Nails or Studs, the Universe seem'd to me too little and strait; I fansied my self to be confin'd and oppress'd: But now when I am perswaded, that this Azure Vault has a greater depth and a vaster Extent, and that 'tis divided into a thousand and a thousand different Tourbillions or Whirlings, I imagine I am at more Liberty, and breath a freer Air; and the Universe appears to me to be infinitely more Magnificent. Nature has spared nothing in her Production, and hath profusely bestow'd her Treasures upon a glorious Work worthy of her: You can represent nothing so august to your self, as this prodigious Number of Tourbillions, whose Center is possess'd by a Sun, that makes the Planets turn round him. The Inhabitants of the Planets of any of these infinite Tourbillions, see from all sides the enlightned Center of the Tourbillion with which they are inviron'd; but cannot discover the Planets of another, who enjoy but a faint Light, borrow'd from their own Sun, which it does not dart further than its own Sphere or Activity.

The English translation simplifies this by presenting it as a more direct statement of fact ('nay, some Astronomers make the distance yet greater'), reducing stylistic complexity and making the idea more straightforward.","The French uses a repeated 'il faudroit que' (it would be necessary that...) construction, creating a formal conditional sequence. The English translation simplifies this structure into more direct statements ('it must certainly be...') and an imperative ('Then consider...'), making the argument easier to follow. The detail about reflection further weakening the light ('qui l'affoibliroit encore beaucoup') is also less explicitly emphasized.","The French source provides the crucial two-sentence conclusion to the philosopher's argument that fixed stars must be self-luminous. The English translation omits this entire conclusion, simplifying the text by removing a key logical step in the scientific explanation, thereby reducing its density. The provided target segment shows the end of the philosopher's preceding sentence and the start of the Marquise's subsequent (unrelated) line, highlighting the point of omission.","The French original has the Marquise begin her excited realization with 'Ne me trompay-je point... ou si je vois où vous me voulez mener?' (Am I not mistaken... or do I see where you are leading me?). The English translation omits this engaging introductory phrase, simplifying the conversational flow and reducing the portrayal of the Marquise's thought process. The target segment is the beginning of her speech in English, which directly starts with her deduction.","The philosopher's witty and learned response in French, which includes a classical allusion to Racine's Phèdre ('C'est toi qui l'as nommé..'), is completely omitted in the English translation. This removal simplifies the text by stripping away a layer of erudition and cultural richness, making the dialogue more direct but less nuanced. The target text shows the end of the Marquise's speech and the beginning of her next lines, between which the philosopher's French response was omitted.","The French phrase 'jettez confusément les uns parmi les autres' offers a vivid image of vortices scattered chaotically. The English translation, while conveying the general idea of multiple tourbillons within the Marquise's speech, omits this specific descriptive element. This simplifies the text by reducing the richness of its imagery. The target segment shows part of the Marquise's speech in English where this imagery is absent.","The French text specifies a decreasing clarity in the Marquise's perception of inhabitants: Earth (clearest), then Moon and planets of our tourbillon ('assez clairement... mais moins que ceux de la Terre' - clearly enough... but less than those of Earth). The English translation simplifies this by stating the philosopher 'plainly presented to my Reason' these inhabitants, omitting the explicit qualification of lesser clarity compared to Earth's inhabitants, thereby removing a nuance of graded perception.","The French 'avoüez que vous ne sauriez presque plus nous déméler au milieu de tant de Mondes' expresses a nuanced concern about humanity losing its distinguishability in the vast cosmos. The English translation simplifies this to a more general and perhaps more conventional existential question, 'what shall become of us...?', losing the specific intellectual point about the difficulty of 'disentangling' or distinguishing humanity.","The French uses an impersonal and somewhat abstract construction: 'c'eût eté faire trop mal sa Cour que de luy en parler' (it would have been to pay one's court very badly to speak to him of them). The English translation simplifies this by using a more concrete structure with a personal subject: 'he wou'd have made his Court very ill... who shou'd but have mention'd 'em,' making the scenario more direct and easier to follow.","The French phrase 'Ils ne guerissent tout au plus, selon votre raisonnement, que de l'ambition & de l'inquietude' includes 'selon votre raisonnement' (according to your reasoning), linking the philosopher's statement directly to the Marquise's preceding thoughts. The English translation omits this qualifying clause, simplifying the sentence by removing the explicit inter-dialogue reference and making the philosopher's observation more self-contained and absolute."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle, en riant; il se sauve de tout, &amp; il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal.

The original French has the Marquise making two distinct statements: her doubt, then the reasoning she finds weak. The translation simplifies the dialogue structure by merging these two utterances. The Marquise's reasoning (this segment) is incorporated directly as an explanation of the \"small bottom\" mentioned in the previous English segment, making her overall point more compact and arguably easier to follow than the original two-step delivery.","The French phrase \"d'une necessité bien absoluë\" (of a very absolute necessity) uses a slightly more formal and periphrastic noun construction. The English translation \"absolutely necessary\" simplifies this to a more direct and common adjectival phrase.","The French \"folies de galanterie\" (follies/ extravagances of gallantry) is translated as \"some little Gallantries.\" The addition of \"little\" and the choice of \"Gallantries\" (even as a cognate) tones down the intensity and potential extravagance implied by \"folies,\" simplifying the original's somewhat stronger and more literary phrasing into a milder, more common expression.","The French \"Vous ne sauriez accorder\" (a polite conditional, lit. 'you would not know how to grant') is simplified to the more direct \"you cannot allow.\" More significantly, the complex subordinate clause \"que bien tôt aprés il ne faille luy en accorder davantage\" (that soon after it isn't necessary that one not grant him more, implying one must grant more, using impersonal 'falloir' + subjunctive) is greatly simplified to an active, direct statement: \"but he will soon perswade you to yield another,\" which avoids the impersonal verb, subjunctive mood, and double negation logic.","The French phrase \"qu'il faudra que vous luy accordiez aussi\" (that it will be necessary that you grant him also), which uses the future tense of the impersonal verb 'falloir' plus a subjunctive, is simplified to the more direct English modal construction \"which you must yield also.\" This change avoids the impersonal verb and subjunctive mood, making the sentence structure simpler and the obligation more direct.","The original French presents a conditional proviso: \"s'il n'y a rien d'ailleurs qui m'en empêche\" (if there is nothing, moreover, that prevents me from it). The translation replaces this with a rhetorical question, \"for where is the hindrance or difficulty?\", which asserts that no such hindrance exists. This simplifies the logical structure by removing the conditional aspect and making the argument's progression more assertive and less nuanced.","The concise French phrase \"je leur attribuë tout ce qu'il a\" (I attribute to them all that it [the Sun] has) is significantly expanded in the English translation. The target text spells out the implications of \"tout ce qu'il a\" by stating: \"they are Suns, and have Planets turning round about 'em; and every thing else we attribute to our Suns.\" This explicitation simplifies the reader's task of inference by making the philosopher's conclusions detailed and unambiguous.","The French \"il faut franchir le pas de bonne grâce\" (it is necessary to take the step/cross the threshold with good grace) uses the somewhat metaphorical phrase \"franchir le pas\" and the impersonal \"il faut.\" The English translation simplifies this to \"you must generously yield.\" This uses the more direct verb \"yield,\" fitting an argumentative context, and changes the impersonal \"il faut\" to the personal \"you must,\" making the injunction clearer and more straightforward.","The French uses the general term \"les Gens\" (the People) and a complex grammatical construction \"il faut que... ne le voyent que comme\" (it is necessary that... see it only as), involving the impersonal 'falloir que' + subjunctive + 'ne...que' for 'only'. The translation simplifies this by using the more specific \"the Inhabitants\" and the more direct modal construction \"must only see,\" which avoids the impersonal verb and subjunctive mood.","The French uses the pronoun \"que la leur\" (than theirs), referring back to 'lumiere' (light). The English translation \"than the Light of the other Suns\" simplifies comprehension by explicitly restating \"the Light\" instead of using a pronoun. This reduces the cognitive load on the reader by making the referent explicit.","The French \"Nous ne voyons donc que luy\" (We therefore see only it) is simplified to \"we see nothing else,\" a common and direct English equivalent for the 'ne...que' (only) construction; the logical connector \"donc\" (therefore) is also omitted, streamlining the sentence. Furthermore, the concise French \"il efface tout\" (it effaces/erases everything) is expanded to \"his brightness makes all other things disappear.\" This explicitation clarifies the cause (brightness) and the effect (disappear), simplifying comprehension by making the process more descriptive.","The single French verb \"efface\" (effaces/blots out/erases) is translated as the two-verb phrase \"removes and darkens.\" This expansion breaks down the general concept of \"effacing\" into two more specific and concrete actions, making the sun's effect on other celestial bodies more explicit and arguably easier to visualize, thus simplifying the original's more condensed expression.","The French uses an impersonal construction \"On l'attache\" (One attaches it) and the phrase \"il y fait partie de quelque Ourse...\" (it there makes part of some Bear...). The translation simplifies this by using a more direct and active description: \"our Sun appears to the Inhabitants of that Tourbillion... as a Star of some Constellation, such as the Bear...\" This clarifies the agent of perception (Inhabitants, added for clarity), changes the metaphorical \"attaches\" to the perceptual \"appears,\" and explicates \"fait partie de\" (makes part of) as being \"a Star of some Constellation,\" simplifying comprehension by making implicit meanings explicit.","The French text uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" twice: \"on ne les voit point\" (one does not see them at all) and \"on n'y songe seulement pas\" (one doesn't even think about it/them). The English translation simplifies these constructions by using the personal pronoun \"they\" (referring to the inhabitants of other worlds): \"they cannot see it\" and \"they do not so much as think of it.\" This makes the agent clearer and the sentence structure more direct.","The translation simplifies by explicitating key terms and merging sentence structures for clarity. Specifically, \"Soleils de nuit\" (Suns by night) is clarified to \"fix'd Stars by Night,\" preventing potential misinterpretation. The passive \"où ils sont placez\" (where they are placed) becomes the more active and descriptive \"which they govern.\" Most notably, the vague French phrase \"ils ne servent qu'à faire nombre\" (they only serve to make up numbers/fill out the count) is rendered as the much more explicit \"serve only to make up the Number of fix'd Stars for all the other Worlds.\" This makes the function of these distant suns significantly clearer. The two distinct French sentences are also woven into a single, more continuous English sentence.","The complex French interrogative \"Ne faut-il pas pourtant... que les Mondes... different\" (Must it not however be that the Worlds... differ), which employs the impersonal verb 'falloir que' and the subjunctive mood, is simplified to a more direct, personal expression of conviction: \"yet I cannot believe, but they differ.\" Additionally, the French \"differences infinies\" (infinite differences) is rendered as \"infinite little differences\"; the addition of \"little\" tones down the scale of \"infinies,\" arguably making the concept less abstract or overwhelming and thus simpler to grasp."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">de deviner.</span></span> Que say-je?

This effectively replaces the subtle meaning of \"guere\" (hardly/scarcely) with a more straightforward \"not\".

The English translation uses 'as you understand it;' followed by a more direct and separate assertion 'and unanswerable', simplifying the clausal dependency.","The translation simplifies by omitting the relative clause 'qui le terminent au dehors' (that bound it on the outside). This reduces textual density and makes the description more direct.","The English 'bigness' is a more common, everyday term for 'grandeur' (largeness, size), representing a vocabulary simplification.","The formal French 'chacune des quelles' (each of which) is simplified to the more colloquial and direct 'every one of 'em'. The use of ''em' for 'them' further reduces formality.","The translation uses 'big' and 'little,' which are common, elementary adjectives, for 'plus grandes' (larger/greater) and 'plus petites' (smaller/lesser), simplifying the vocabulary.","The French conditional structure beginning with 'Que...' (implying 'Suppose that X happens...') involves a subordinate clause describing the tourbillions. The English simplifies this complex sentence setup by using a more common and direct 'if...' clause for the condition. Additionally, the pronoun 'eux' (them) is rendered colloquially as ''em'.","The concise and somewhat metaphorical French phrase 'qui ménage bien le terrain' (who manages space well/economizes) is expanded into a more explicit explanation. While longer, this uses more common terms to break down the idea, simplifying the original's conceptual density for easier comprehension.","The French idiomatic phrase 'ne laissent pas d'être...' (they nevertheless are... / they don't fail to be...) makes an abstract assertion. The translation 'every one of these may have a World in it' rephrases this to be more concrete and arguably easier to grasp by focusing on capacity rather than state of being.","The French 'Ainsi nous pouvons voir' (Thus we can see/deduce) is simplified to 'so that there may be'. This removes the layer of human observation or deduction, stating the consequence more directly and impersonally.","The French idiomatic negative construction 'ils ne laissent pas d'être' (they don't fail to be / they are nonetheless) is simplified to the English emphatic assertion 'yet I doubt not but they are', which is more straightforward for an English reader of the period.","The translation simplifies by omitting 'sans doute' (without doubt), reducing modality. It also simplifies the 'dont on ne découvre...que...' (of which one only discovers...) construction to a more direct 'whose...we discover', removing the impersonal 'on' and the 'ne...que' (only) restrictive structure.","The descriptive French term 'Lunettes d'approche' (literally 'approach glasses') is replaced by 'Telescopes,' a more standard, common, and precise scientific term, simplifying vocabulary.","The French phrase 'sont en une quantité si prodigieuse' (are in such a prodigious quantity) is rephrased to the more concise and direct 'whose number is so prodigious,' simplifying sentence structure.","The French 'comme il faut que...' (as it is necessary that... / as each must...), indicating necessity, is integrated into a resultative construction in English ('so rightly adjusted... that...'). This simplifies the explicit statement of necessity into a more flowing consequence.","The somewhat verbose French phrase 'dans la situation où il est' (in the situation in which it is) is simplified to the more concise phrase 'to its place.'","The French 's'engrainent' (mesh, interlock like gears) and 'en quelque façon' (in some way) is simplified to 'They are fixed to one another'. This uses a more general and less precise term, omitting the nuance of interlocking and the qualifying phrase, significantly simplifying vocabulary and imagery.","The original French presents a full clause 'Il est pourtant vray qu'ils agissent...' (It is however true that they act...). The English translation reduces this to a participial phrase 'and yet moving...', which is a significant structural simplification, making the idea subordinate to the preceding statement.","The French 'il rentre en luy-même' (it re-enters itself / goes back into itself) is somewhat metaphorical. The English 'it shrinks to its first form' uses a more common verb ('shrinks') and provides a more direct, physical description, simplifying the original's abstractness.","The French 'ne...que parce que...' structure, meaning 'only because' and emphasizing the sole reason, is simplified to a straightforward 'because...' in English. This removes the emphasis conveyed by 'ne...que,' making the causal relationship simpler in structure."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort toutes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">ces Idées-là</span></span>, dit la Marquise.

This addition explicitly attributes the ideas to the philosopher, reducing ambiguity about their origin and thereby simplifying comprehension for the reader by making the reference more direct.","The French verb 'se desenflent' (meaning to deflate or shrink), within the phrase 's'enflent & se desenflent' (swell and deflate), is translated using the simpler and more common English verb 'fall' (in the parallel construction 'swell and fall'). This substitution simplifies the vocabulary, making the description more accessible.","The French adverb 'asseurément' (meaning 'assuredly' or 'certainly') is omitted in the translation of this clause.

The English translation simplifies by specifying the agents as \"Envoys.\" This concretizes the action, making it more specific and akin to human diplomatic missions, which is an easier concept to visualize than the more abstract original phrasing.","The French describes the comets' adornments using a disjunctive list \"ou...ou...ou\" (\"either...or...or\"), suggesting alternative features: \"ornées, ou d'une chevelure éclatante, ou d'une barbe venerable, ou d'une queüe majestueuse.\" (adorned with, either shining hair, or a venerable beard, or a majestic tail.). The English translation simplifies this structure into a conjunctive list: \"adorn'd with shining Hair, a venerable Beard, and a Royal Train.\" This change from alternatives to a cumulative list simplifies the descriptive logic. Furthermore, the specific translation of \"une queüe majestueuse\" (a majestic tail) as \"a Royal Train\" simplifies by substituting a general description with a more concrete, culturally specific, and vivid image evoking human royalty, enhancing accessibility."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P100: Ah! quels Deputez dit-elle en riant!

Ces Planetes étrangeres ont un air bien menaçant avec leurs queües &amp; leurs barbes, &amp; peut- être on nous les envoye pour nous insulter, au lieu que les nôtres, qui ne sont pas faites de la même manière, ne seroient pas si propres à se faire craindre, quand elles iroient dans les autres Mondes. </p><p>P103: Les queües &amp; les barbes, répondis-je, ne sont que de pures apparences.. Les Planetes étrangères ne diffèrent en rien des nôtres, mais en entrant dans nütre Tourbillon, elles prennent la queüe ou la barbe par une certaine sorte d'illumination qu'elles reçoivent du Soleil, &amp; qui entre nous n'a pas encore êté trop bien expliquée; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">mais toûjours on est sûr qu'il ne s'agit que d'une espèce d'illumination; on la devinera quand on pourra.</span></span> Je voudrois donc bien, reprit- elle, que nôtre Saturne allât prendre une queuë ou une barbe dans quelque autre Tourbillon, &amp; y répandre l'effroy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">&amp; qu'en suite ayant mis bas cet accompagnement terrible, il revint se ranger ici avec les autres Planetes à ses fonctions ordinaires.</span></span> Il vaut mieux pour luy, répondis-je, qu'il ne sorte point de nôtre Tourbillon. Je vous ay dit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">le choc qui se fait à l'endroit où deux Tourbillons se poussent &amp; se repoussent l'un l'autre; je croy que dans ce pas là une pauvre Planete est agitée assez rudement</span></span>, &amp; que ses Habitans ne s'en portent pas mieux. Nous croyons nous autres être bien malheureux quand il nous paroît une Comete elle-même qui est bien malheureuse. Je ne le crois point, dit la Marquise, elle nous apporte tous ses Habitans en bonne santé. Rien n'est si divertissant que de changer ainsi de Tourbillon. Nous qui ne sortons jamais du nôtre, nous menons une vie assez ennuyeuse. Si les Habitans d'une Comete ont assez d'esprit pour prévoir le temps de leur passage dans notre Monde, ceux qui ont déjà fait le voyage, annoncent aux autres par avance ce qu'ils y verront. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Vous découvrirez bien-tôt une Planete qui a un grand Anneau autour d'elle, disent-ils peut-être en parlant de Saturne.</span></span> Vous en verrez une autre qui en a quatre petites qui la suivent.

Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles Fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumière; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">car que faire sans Soleil?</span></span> Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? Je vous diray, si vous voulez, répondis je, ce que disent de fort habiles Gens, que les Etoiles Fixes qui ont disparu ne sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est-à-dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mêmes, tantôt ils nous présentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantôt la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion-là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoître, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mêmes? Vous êtes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur.</span></span> Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir.</span></span> En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles Fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantôt plus grandes tantôt plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus légers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile;</span></span> mais voicy un étrange malheur. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement,</span></span> des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoîtroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoître de longtemps. Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">&amp; adieu le Soleil.</span></span> Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">&amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet.</span></span> Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience?</span></span> Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">&amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé.</span></span> Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas.</span></span> Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration,</span></span> je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">On n'est pas si aisément éternel.</span></span> Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">il faut que l'espce se repare.</span></span> Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner.</span></span> Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">&amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage.</span></span> De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, répliquai-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au-delà, il faudroit être plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent être ou n'être pas si on veut, ou être tels que l'on veut,</span></span> il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P074: I understand you, said she, and am pleas'd with your Chamber of State; for we do not permit 'em to come directly in the middle of our Tourbillion, but receive 'em as the Grand Seignior does his Foreign Ministers; he does 'em not the Honour to lodge 'em in Constantinople, but sends 'em to the Suburbs. Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or false Light. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light? The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, and then farewell the Sun and all its Light. 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect. The Ancients were foolish to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience; but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener, but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is: Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever, yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? Eternity is not so easy a matter; and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish. Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them. If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other. Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie.

The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">and then farewell the Sun and all its Light.</span></span> 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect.</span></span> The Ancients were foolish to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience;</span></span> but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener,</span></span> but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is:</span></span> Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever,</span></span> yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">Eternity is not so easy a matter;</span></span> and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish.</span></span> Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them.</span></span> If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other.</span></span> Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie.</span></span> 'Tis sufficient for me to have carried your Understanding as far as your sight can penetrate.</p>","explanations":["The French \"A en juger par toutes ces choses là\" (Judging by all these things) is a somewhat complex and formal introductory phrase. The English \"At this rate\" simplifies this to a shorter, more idiomatic, and direct expression.","The English translation adds \"or false Light\" to explain \"Illumination.\" This explicitation simplifies the concept for the reader by providing a more common term. The French \"on la devinera quand on pourra\" (one will figure it out when one can) is also slightly more abstract than the more direct \"let this be found out when it can.\"","The French \"il revint se ranger ici avec les autres Planetes à ses fonctions ordinaires\" (he would return to take his place here with the other planets to his ordinary functions) is simplified. The English \"he wou'd return... to his own place\" omits the detail \"à ses fonctions ordinaires,\" reducing textual density.","The French \"le choc... se poussent & se repoussent l'un l'autre\" (the shock... push and repel each other) and the vivid spatial metaphor \"dans ce pas là\" (in that passage/strait) are simplified to the softer \"the Encounter... pushing against one another\" and the general \"upon that occasion,\" reducing descriptive intensity.","The French \"disent-ils peut-être\" (they say perhaps) includes \"peut-être\" (perhaps), a nuance of speculation. The English translation omits an equivalent of \"perhaps,\" presenting the identification of Saturn as more certain and streamlining the statement.","The English translation adds the clause \"after a long Sea-Voyage\" to the comparison with sailors. This addition provides context and clarifies the analogy, simplifying the original's more concise simile by making it more explicit.","The French construction \"Il ne faut donc plus songer... à vous donner de la pitié\" (One must therefore no longer think... to make you feel pity) is somewhat formal and impersonal. The English \"I hope you will no longer pity\" simplifies this into a more direct and personal expression.","The French \"car que faire sans Soleil?\" (for what to do without a Sun?) is a rhetorical question. The English \"for there is no living without a Sun\" translates this into a declarative statement, simplifying by providing a direct assertion rather than an evocative question.","The French \"je feray encore un effort en votre faveur\" (I will make another effort in your favour) is a general statement. The English \"I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way\" is more specific about the effort, simplifying by clarifying the speaker's intention.","The French presents two consecutive clauses linked by \"et\" (and). The English uses a relative clause \"which removes 'em from our sight,\" making the causal relationship more direct and syntactically integrated, simplifying comprehension.","The French \"demeure immobile\" (remains immobile/motionless) is a precise term. The English \"remain where they did before\" expresses stasis in more common, less absolute language, simplifying the concept.","The French \"viennent se montrer à nous\" (come to show themselves to us) is simplified to \"appear to us.\" Also, \"disparoisent entièrement\" (disappear entirely) is expanded to \"entirely vanish, and are lost,\" simplifying by reinforcing the meaning with added explicitness.","The French \"adieu le Soleil\" (farewell the Sun) is concise. The English expands this to \"farewell the Sun and all its Light,\" explicitly stating the consequence (loss of light), simplifying the implication by making it direct.","The French warning \"ne vous y fiez point\" (don't trust it) is omitted, simplifying the tone. Additionally, \"soit lents, soit prompts\" (be they slow, or quick) is rendered as the common idiom \"Changes must come sooner or later,\" simplifying the phrasing.","The French rhetorical question \"Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience?\" is transformed into an expanded declarative statement, making the argument more explicit and easier to follow, thus simplifying the suggestive questioning style.","The French \"de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose\" (more than fifteen thousand ages of Roses) is simplified by removing \"de plus de\" (more than). The clause detailing transmission, \"les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre,\" is condensed to \"the others that had follow'd 'em,\" reducing structural complexity.","The French \"il ne change seulement pas\" (he only does not change) is a concise statement. The English expands this to \"nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is,\" making the mistaken conclusion more explicit and emphatic, simplifying comprehension by elaborating.","The complex French construction \"quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration\" is significantly simplified to the more concise and direct English phrasing \"and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever,\" reducing structural complexity and length.","The French impersonal construction \"On n'est pas si aisément éternel\" (One is not so easily eternal) is simplified into a more direct statement, \"Eternity is not so easy a matter,\" using a common English idiom.","The concise French \"il faut que l'espce se repare\" (the species must be repaired/renewed) is expanded with the interpretative \"that Defect in Nature\" and the clarifying \"and no Species can totally perish,\" simplifying the original's brevity by making implications explicit.","The French verb \"se démêler de\" (to disentangle oneself from) implies a complex action. The English \"cast off\" is a more direct and common phrasal verb, simplifying the imagery of removing the crust.","The French \"qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage\" (that it costs her no more) is concise. The English expands this by specifying \"Pains and Expence,\" making the nature of the 'cost' more explicit and concrete, thus simplifying the abstract statement.","The French specifies two philosophical choices: existence (\"peuvent être ou n'être pas si on veut\") and nature (\"être tels que l'on veut\"). The English simplifies this by condensing both into the general act of \"as they themselves shall fansie,\" reducing the specificity of the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers!
