This subtitle explicitly states the scientific theme of the first conversation, immediately introducing the Copernican model, a central aspect of Fontenelle's popularization effort. Its omission in the target text means the reader is not provided with this direct framing, making the chapter's specific scientific content less immediately apparent and potentially obscuring the work's direct engagement with revolutionary astronomical ideas from the outset. This withholding of key contextual and thematic information present in the source constitutes an indirect manipulation by altering the reader's initial perception of the chapter's focus."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P002: Nous allâmes donc un Soir aprés Soupé, nous promener dans le Parc. Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description</span></span>, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante.</span></span> Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche.</span></span> Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je.</span></span> Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné.</span></span> Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface.</span></span> Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">mon imagination s'est échappée.</span></span> Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer</span></span>; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.</span></span> Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, répliquai-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"12\">la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.</span></span> Cherchez ailleurs des Philosophes </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day.

The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night.

Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self.

This lessens the intensity of the narrator's potential reverie.","The French 'Brune' (brunette/dark-featured), used to describe a type of beauty, is consistently translated as 'black.' This choice is starker and less nuanced than 'brune' (or the English 'brunette'), potentially altering the reader's perception of the aesthetic category and its connotations.","The original \"si elle ne touche\" (if it doesn't touch/move one emotionally) implies a need for deep emotional impact. The translation \"unless it charm\" lowers this standard to mere allure or captivation, altering the Marquise's expressed criterion for true beauty.","The original states that the night deserves or receives lovers' thanks. The translation replaces this with an explanation of *why* lovers address the night (\"because it most obliges them\"), thereby adding causal reasoning not present in the source and changing the statement's core meaning.","The French \"Apparemment\" (apparently, seemingly) conveys conjecture. The translation \"'tis certain\" converts this into a statement of definite fact, making the narrator's assertion more dogmatic and less nuanced than in the original.","The French \"efface\" (erases/wipes out) describes a neutral consequence of the sun's brightness. \"Robs us of them\" personifies the sun with negative intent, as if it were a thief, thus changing the connotation from a natural phenomenon to an act of deliberate deprivation.","The original \"mon imagination s'est échappée\" (my imagination escaped/got carried away) describes an involuntary flight of fancy. The translation \"I as soon discovered it [my folly]\" completely alters the meaning, shifting from the imaginative act itself to the narrator's subsequent awareness.","\"Helas!\" (Alas!), expressing gentle regret, is replaced by \"Faith,\" a more assertive interjection. \"Je suis bien fâché\" (I am very sorry/vexed), conveying personal emotion, becomes the formal \"I find my self necessitated.\" This combination changes the tone of the narrator's confession from playfully rueful to more abrupt and less personal.","\"Réjoüit\" (delights) is translated as the more informal and physical \"tickles,\" potentially trivializing the intellectual pleasure. \"S'est placée... d'une manière riante\" (settled... in a cheerful way) suggesting gentle inhabitation, becomes \"has... taken possession,\" implying a forceful, involuntary takeover. This alters the perceived nature and impact of the idea.","The original states that \"agrément\" (pleasantness/charm) is \"necessaire\" (necessary) even for Truths. The translation \"delight is not amiss\" (i.e., merely acceptable) significantly weakens this assertion, changing a claim of necessity to one of mere permissibility, thereby altering the philosophical weight of the statement.","The omission of \"bien viste\" (very quickly) removes a nuance of the narrator's manner. Furthermore, \"qui ne fait rire que l'esprit\" (which only makes the mind/intellect laugh) uses a specific metaphor of intellectual laughter, which is lost in the more general \"delights only the Mind.\" This combination flattens the character of the response and the description of the pleasure.","The original compliment \"la plus aimable personne que je connoisse\" (the most amiable person I know) is personal and grounded. The translation \"the most lovely person in the World\" changes this to a general, hyperbolic statement, altering the tone of the gallantry from specific appreciation to more conventional flattery."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière de Physique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; &amp; les Planètes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des mondes.</span></span> J'en revenois toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes: &amp; si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir, ce qui reviendrait au même. Mais on veut savoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyait bien, ce serait toujours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voient point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toujours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opéra. Du lieu où vous êtes à l'Opéra, vous ne voyez pas le Théâtre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à votre veue ces roues &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvements. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner comment tout cela joue. Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">on a été long-temps à deviner</span></span> ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers; car représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. Suposons qu'ils voyaient le Vol de Phaéton que les Vents enlèvent, qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton. L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre</span></span>; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">&amp; cent autres rêveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité.</span></span> A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenue bien mécanique? Si mécanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bientôt honte. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit</span></span>, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvements régléz qui dépendent de l'arrangement des parties.

Ils n'admirent la Nature que parce qu'ils la croyent une espece de Magie où l'on n'entend rien; &amp; il est seur qu'une chose est deshonorée auprès d'eux, dés qu'elle peut être conceüe. Mais, Madame, continuay-je, vous êtes si bien disposée à entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire, que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, &amp; à vous montrer le Monde.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World.</span></span> So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">it has been the study of many days to resolve</span></span>, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre</span></span>, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity</span></span>: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little</span></span>, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts.

This omission simplifies the presented thesis and reduces the radical scope of the plurality of worlds concept, shifting the reader's initial perception of Fontenelle's ideas.","The French 'long-temps' (a long time), indicating a vast historical period of inquiry, is rendered as 'the study of many days.' This drastic reduction in timescale minimizes the perceived difficulty and duration of scientific endeavor, altering the reader's understanding of the history of science described by Fontenelle.","The satirical French 'amitié' (friendship), used by Fontenelle to mock ancient teleological explanations, is translated as the more formal 'natural Propensity.' This lexical shift diminishes the original's satirical tone, making the ancient idea seem less absurd and more like a serious philosophical concept, thus changing the intended critique.","The translation intensifies Fontenelle's critique by changing 'cent autres rêveries' (a hundred other daydreams/fantasies) to 'a thousand other extravagancies,' and 'perdu de réputation' (discredited/caused to lose reputation) to the more violent 'blasted the Reputation.' This exaggeration and harsher imagery alter the tone from gentle mockery to strong dismissal.","The French impersonal 'On veut' (the tendency is / it is thought), suggesting a general philosophical trend towards a mechanistic universe, is translated as 'Some will have it.' This narrows the scope, presenting the mechanistic worldview as a minority opinion rather than a broader modern development. This subtly alters the perceived impact of this new philosophy, potentially to moderate its challenge within the English socio-religious context."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

The English translation \"with it\" (which would accurately translate \"avec soi,\" meaning \"with itself\") neutralizes this connotation, rendering the movement as purely mechanical. This omission of the qualitative aspect of \"foy\" subtly alters the original meaning by removing a layer of description that might hint at a designed or intrinsically regular system, a nuance potentially significant in a period of shifting cosmological and theological views.","The original French uses the vivid personification \"Astronomy is the daughter of Idleness,\" which contributes to Fontenelle's characteristic literary charm and accessible style. The translation \"Astronomy derives it self from Idleness\" replaces this with a more abstract, formal, and less engaging phrase. This shift lessens the original's wit and charm, subtly altering the reader's perception of Fontenelle's style by making it seem more academic and less engagingly literary.","Fontenelle's original \"Geometry is the daughter of Interest\" continues the pattern of charming personification. The English translation, through its elliptical construction \"and Geometry from Interest\" (which implies \"derives itself from Interest\" following the preceding clause \"Astronomy derives it self from Idleness\"), opts for a more formal and abstract connection. This choice consistently diminishes the literary vivacity of Fontenelle's original prose, presenting the ideas in a more detached and less allegorically rich manner.","The French \"qu'elle est fille de l'Amour\" (that she [Poetry] is the daughter of Love) maintains Fontenelle's engaging use of personification. The translation \"it draws its Original from Love\" substitutes this with a more formal and less direct expression. This consistent alteration of Fontenelle's stylistic choice to use personification subtly manipulates the reader's experience by reducing the literary charm and wit that characterized the original work's popularization of complex ideas."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie.</span></span> La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus intéressée que je ne l'ai, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe.</span></span> Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible.</span></span> Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">mais apparemment fort peu devot</span></span>, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus</span></span> qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux</span></span> par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere</span></span>, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là.</span></span> Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides</span></span> qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué</span></span>, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">that the ancient System is not at all tenable.</span></span> But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">World</span></span>, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry</span></span>, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye.</span></span> Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">it would have astonish'd you.</span></span> The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">but something irreligious</span></span>, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens</span></span> that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens</span></span>, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering</span></span>, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another;</span></span> yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me.

The translation incorrectly expands her commitment in the phrase \"I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry,\" altering the clarity of her singular focus, even though the subsequent part of the sentence explains why she wouldn't pursue Geometry and Poetry.","The French \"froidement\" (coldly, dispassionately) is translated as \"jejunely.\" While \"coldly\" can suggest a lack of engagement or a detached response, \"jejunely\" implies the philosophers' answer is intellectually weak, unsatisfying, or meager. This intensifies the criticism of the philosophers' traditional views, subtly aligning the reader more strongly with the new, critical perspective Fontenelle is promoting.","The original \"épouvante horrible\" (horrible fright/terror) implies a strong, almost visceral reaction to the complexity of the Ptolemaic system. The translation \"astonish'd you\" significantly weakens this, reducing the impact to mere surprise. This downplays the philosopher's intended emphasis on the overwhelming and frightening complexity of the older model.","The French \"apparemment fort peu devot\" (apparently very un-devout/not very pious) is translated as \"something irreligious.\" The word \"something\" softens the degree of the King of Aragon's impiety compared to the French \"fort peu\" (very little/not very). This slight moderation could be an attempt to make the anecdote less jarring to a contemporary English audience potentially sensitive to perceived attacks on religion, aligning with the religio-political context of the late 17th century.","The French \"Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus\" (Apparently/Presumably they also concerned two or three superfluous Heavens) indicates a speculative attribution to the king and an indefinite small number of superfluous heavens. The translation changes \"Apparemment\" (Apparently) to \"'tis most certain,\" making the narrator's assertion about the King's thoughts more definitive. It also changes the indefinite \"deux ou trois\" (two or three) to the specific \"those three,\" making the criticized ancient model seem more fixed in its error and the King's critique more precise than suggested by the original's speculative tone and indefinite number.","The French \"briseroient\" (would break), describing what comets would do to solid heavens, implies a more definite and direct consequence. The translation \"might hazard the cracking\" introduces an element of possibility or risk rather than certainty. This slightly softens the destructive potential attributed to comets in this hypothetical scenario, making the argument against solid heavens a tiny bit less forceful in its imagery of destruction.","The French \"Il sembleroit\" (It would seem/It would appear) expresses a tentative or hypothetical observation by the Marquise. The translation \"I see\" makes her statement more direct, assertive, and conclusive. This alters the Marquise's characterization slightly, making her sound more forthright and less speculative than in the original.","The original French \"qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien\" (which will cost her a little less, even if that 'less' were almost nothing) emphasizes Nature's extreme efficiency, highlighting its tendency to choose the method that is even infinitesimally less costly. The translation \"as may cost her little or nothing\" simplifies this, losing the specific nuance of striving for even the slightest reduction in \"cost\" or effort, thereby slightly diminishing the portrayal of Nature's meticulous parsimony.","The French idiom \"fait main basse sur\" (literally 'makes low hand on', meaning to make short work of, clear out, or make a clean sweep of) implies a more aggressive, sweeping, and decisive action. The translation \"pull'd down\" is more literal and less dynamic. It slightly diminishes the dramatic and iconoclastic force attributed to Copernicus's dismantling of ancient cosmological structures.","The French \"du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué\" means \"the long rest it (the Earth) had attributed to itself\" or \"claimed for itself.\" The translation \"for her long idle repose\" introduces the adjective \"idle,\" which carries a negative connotation of laziness or unproductive inactivity not explicitly present in \"s'estoit attribué.\" This subtly reinforces the idea of the Earth's previous stasis being undeserved or blameworthy, thus justifying Copernicus's \"chastisement\" more strongly."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient.

Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil.

The translation \"no great kindness\" is a significant understatement (litotes) that considerably softens the perceived malice attributed to Copernicus (the \"German\"). This alters the tone by reducing the intensity of the Marquise's criticism, making Copernicus seem less antagonistic.","\"Je luy sçay bon gré\" expresses clear gratitude or approval (\"I am grateful to him\" / \"I give him credit\"). The translation \"I know\" is a neutral acknowledgement, omitting the philosopher's explicit endorsement of Copernicus's humbling effect on humanity. This subtly changes the philosopher's expressed stance from active approval to mere awareness.","The French \"Je vous jure\" (I swear to you) is a strong, emphatic assertion. \"I profess\" is more formal and notably less forceful. This lexical choice tones down the Marquise's passionate conviction, subtly altering her character's expressive intensity and making her statement more reserved.","The common French interjection \"Mon Dieu\" (My God), which adds emotional emphasis, is omitted. This removal flattens the philosopher's dialogue, reducing its expressiveness. Given the religious sensitivities in England during James II's reign, this omission might also be a deliberate cultural adaptation to make the text less potentially controversial, thereby manipulating the original's familiar tone.","\"Bien aise\" (very pleased/glad) indicates a strong degree of satisfaction. The translation \"well enough pleas'd\" introduces a qualification that diminishes this intensity, suggesting only moderate contentment. This subtly understates the described self-satisfaction of geocentric thinkers.","The French verb \"s'intéresser\" (in the phrase \"son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire\") means \"to take an interest.\" The translation substitutes this with the noun phrase \"a self-interest\" (in \"his Heart cannot forbear a self-interest\"). This explicitly defines the nature of the heart's involvement as selfish, whereas the original is more general. This addition narrows the meaning and imposes a more cynical interpretation of the philosopher's inherent inclination.","The French \"humiliant\" (humiliating) describes something that causes humiliation. The English \"humble\" describes a state of modesty. This semantic shift is significant: the Marquise originally states Copernicus's system is demeaning to human pride. The translation reframes this by suggesting the system itself is merely modest, thereby altering the basis of her argument and lessening the perceived affront to humanity.","The direct and stark French statement \"Il mourut\" (He died) is altered by the addition of the English colloquial interjection \"Faith\". This addition changes the tone of the philosopher's impactful announcement about Copernicus, making it more conversational and less formal, subtly manipulating the dramatic effect of the original.","The French \"il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là\" suggests it is not fitting or appropriate for the Marquise's role or station to be seen making scientific drawings. The translation \"it is not for my credit\" shifts her motivation specifically towards concern for her reputation or social standing. This subtly alters the reader's perception of her character, emphasizing concern for public image over a sense of social propriety or role."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs.

The translation \"She is not easily movable\" changes this to an inherent characteristic of the Earth (its difficulty to be moved). This alters the Marquise's playful complaint from Earth being subjected to demanding tasks to Earth's inherent nature making these tasks seem more burdensome, subtly shifting the reader's understanding.","The French \"on luy demande bien de l'agilité\" (one demands much agility from it) uses an active construction suggesting an external agent or system is making a demand on Earth. The translation \"it will require a good proportion of Agility\" uses an impersonal phrasing, presenting agility as an inherent necessity or prerequisite for Earth's function. This shift diminishes the original's slight personification and the sense of an imposed burden, framing Earth's agility as a natural property of the situation rather than something actively demanded.","\"Astres\" in French is a general term for all celestial bodies (including planets, the Moon, comets, and fixed stars). The translation \"Stars\" typically refers more specifically to fixed stars. By translating \"tous les autres Astres\" as \"all the Stars,\" the translation narrows the scope of celestial bodies considered in Fontenelle's counter-argument against geocentrism. The original implies that *all* celestial bodies would have to make an immense daily tour.

The translation 'such a Shuttlecock or Whirligigg,' by adding 'Shuttlecock,' introduces a specific image of an object known for its light, potentially erratic and uncontrolled flight. This addition amplifies the perceived instability or triviality of the Earth's motion in the Copernican system more than the original, subtly shifting the perception of the Marquise's concern.","The French 'nous autres Coperniciens, nous sommes assez inconsideres' (we Copernicans are rather/quite reckless) is presented as a direct observation by the Marquise.

This addition subjectivizes her statement, making her sound more hesitant or merely expressing a personal view, rather than making a more assertive observation, subtly altering her characterization.","The French phrase 'vous tournerez avec plaisir, & vous vous ferez sur ce Systême des idées réjouissantes' describes two distinct sources of future enjoyment for the Marquise: first, the pleasure of 'turning' (experientially embracing the Copernican model) and second, forming joyful ideas about the system. The English translation 'and have delightful Idea's of this System' largely omits the first component ('vous tournerez avec plaisir'). This omission removes the emphasis on the experiential joy of adopting the new worldview, focusing instead only on the intellectual pleasure derived from its ideas, thereby shifting the perceived nature of engaging with the new science.","The French 'tous ces visages differens' (all these different faces) specifically refers to human faces, highlighting the human diversity seen in the philosopher's imagined global view. The translation 'all these different appearances' is more general and abstract. This change subtly depersonalizes the vision, shifting the focus from the direct observation of varied human individuals to a more detached catalogue of varied forms, potentially lessening the human-centric impact of the scene.","The French 'Têtes rases' translates to 'shaven heads,' indicating a deliberate cultural practice or personal choice. The English translation 'others bald' typically refers to natural hair loss.

The English translation \"who seems not much to heed it\" shifts this to an external observation of the prisoner's apparent state. This change diminishes the prisoner's agency and the deliberateness of their behavior, subtly altering the portrayal of their character from one of active defiance to one of passive appearance or genuine indifference.","The French \"un lieu obseur\" translates to \"an obscure/dark place,\" which is a relatively neutral description. The English translation \"a Hole\" carries a more specific and negative connotation, suggesting a place that is small, confined, squalid, or primitive. This alteration subtly denigrates the dwelling of the \"Grand Prêtre,\" potentially manipulating the reader's perception of this religious figure and their practices by making them seem more base or less dignified.","The original French \"au premier venu\" means \"to the first comer\" or \"to anyone who comes along,\" emphasizing a lack of discrimination in choosing partners. The English translation \"at first sight\" shifts the meaning to immediacy upon seeing someone. More significantly, the addition of a question mark at the end of the clause in the English translation, which is absent in Fontenelle's declarative statement, introduces a tone of incredulity, surprise, or authorial query. This editorial interjection manipulates the reader by casting doubt on or sensationalizing the described behavior of the Circassian women, altering the neutral, albeit exoticizing, tone of the original.","Fontenelle's \"debiterons ... des rêveries\" (literally \"we will perhaps still be recounting/uttering ... musings/daydreams\") modestly and charmingly characterizes the philosophical speculations as imaginative but light, whimsical thoughts. The English translation \"shall yet find other extravagant Inventions\" significantly alters this. \"Extravagant Inventions\" suggests elaborate fabrications or creations that are excessive and potentially untrue, rather than the more whimsical or speculative \"rêveries.\" This change in diction manipulates the reader's understanding of the nature and seriousness of the philosopher's discourse, potentially making it sound more far-fetched, deliberately fabricated, or less credible than Fontenelle intended."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P015: Il est assez plaisant, dit la Marquise, d'imaginer ce que vous venez de me dire; mais si je voyois tout cela d'en haut, je voudrais avoir la liberté de hâter ou d'arrêter le mouvement de la Terre, selon que les objets me plairont plus ou moins, &amp; je vous assure que je ferais passer bien vite ceux qui s'embarrassent de Politique, ou qui mangent leurs Ennemis; mais il y en a d'autres pour qui j'aurois de la curiosité.

This subtly alters the perception of the Circassian men's actions, making the custom seem less like neglect and more like a regulated practice, thereby shifting the reader's understanding of this social dynamic.","The original \"ne relâchent rien\" (do not release/give up anything) refers specifically to husbands not yielding their wives' favors. The translation \"give no liberty at all\" broadens this into a general denial of \"liberty.\" In the context of late 17th-century England, where \"liberty\" was a potent political and religious term (e.g., Declaration for Liberty of Conscience), this substitution introduces a contemporary socio-political resonance not present in Fontenelle's more specific, social-sexual comment, potentially manipulating the reader by framing the Marquise's observation in terms of a wider, highly charged contemporary debate.","The French states \"the entire silkworm cocoon turns at the same time,\" referring to the model in the analogy (or the Earth-system as a cocoon). The English \"This and all the other Cod of the Silkworm turns\" introduces confusing additional elements (\"all the other Cod\"). If \"This\" refers to the Earth-system, the phrase \"and all the other Cod\" is an unexplained and perplexing addition not found in the original. This modification obscures the clarity of Fontenelle's analogy, potentially manipulating the reader's understanding by creating unnecessary confusion or misdirection regarding the scientific explanation.","\"Bien méprisables\" directly translates to \"very contemptible\" or \"very despicable,\" conveying a strong negative judgment from the Marquise. The translation \"contemptible enough\" significantly softens this. The use of \"enough\" lessens the intensity of \"contemptible,\" making the Marquise's reaction seem milder and less forceful than in the original. This toning down of her expressed emotion subtly manipulates the reader's perception of her character's assertiveness and critical judgment.","The French \"une si grande agitation\" (such great agitation/turmoil) describes a state of widespread, significant unrest, fervent activity, or turmoil on Earth. The translation \"make such a noise on all hands\" trivializes this by reducing it to mere \"noise.\" This diminishes the perceived scale and seriousness of human endeavors (like \"grands Travaux\" and \"grandes Guerres\" mentioned just before), thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of Fontenelle's philosophical observation about humanity's preoccupations on the \"petite boule.\"","The French \"me sont suspectes\" indicates that the Marquise finds the philosopher's \"precautions\" (explanations for why the Earth's movement isn't felt) themselves suspicious, implying she doubts their validity or the philosopher's candor. The translation \"I am still very doubtful\" shifts her skepticism from the specific explanations to a more general doubt about the Earth's motion. This subtly manipulates the reader's perception of the Marquise's intellectual engagement, making her seem less critically focused on the arguments presented and more broadly uncertain.","\"Bâiller\" in French means \"to yawn,\" implying the Marquise finds the philosopher's moralizing during a physics discussion boring, irrelevant, or a diversion. \"Bantring\" (bantering) means light-hearted, playful teasing. This translation significantly alters the tone and meaning. Instead of expressing weariness or dismissal of an inappropriate digression, the Marquise is portrayed as engaging in or identifying playful teasing. This manipulates the reader's understanding of her character, softening her critical edge and potentially diminishing her intellectual seriousness in a way contrary to Fontenelle's aim of portraying women as capable scientific interlocutors."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: En retournant au Château je luy dis <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes</span></span>, qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Tycho Brahé qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fût immobile, la plaçoit au centre du Monde, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planètes, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planètes autour de la Terre.

The translation 'to carry on the business of Systems' changes this to suggest merely continuing with the topic, thereby omitting the sense of comprehensive treatment and subtly diminishing the intellectual rigor of the discussion.","The French 'quand on avoit bien envie de la soûtenir' conveys a strong desire or keen inclination to support the idea, possibly hinting at a stubborn or emotionally driven adherence. The translation 'when any one had a mind to maintain it' significantly weakens this to a casual inclination or whim. This alteration softens the critique of resistance to new scientific ideas, changing the reader's perception of the motivations behind clinging to older, less rational systems.","The French verb 'jugea' (judged) attributes a definitive, reasoned assessment to the Marquise, emphasizing her intellectual capacity and decisiveness, which aligns with Fontenelle's aim of showcasing female intellect. The translation 'was of opinion' softens this, portraying her contribution as a more subjective viewpoint or a less formal thought process, thereby subtly diminishing the perceived authority and intellectual agency of the Marquise.","The French 'vous persuade' (persuades you) directly engages the reader (or the Marquise, and by extension, the general reader), which is a key characteristic of Fontenelle's accessible and persuasive style. The English translation 'persuades' omits the direct address 'you,' rendering the statement impersonal and abstract. This change subtly reduces the direct persuasive force and personal engagement intended by Fontenelle, potentially altering the reader's connection with the text and its arguments.","Similar to the 'vous persuade' instance, the French 'sa hardiesse vous fait plaisir' (its boldness pleases you/gives you pleasure) creates a direct connection with the reader by referencing their personal experience. The English translation 'the Boldness delights' removes the pronoun 'vous' (you), making the statement general and impersonal. This shift lessens the immediacy of the reader's engagement and alters the tone from a shared, personal appreciation of the Copernican system's boldness to a more detached observation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">SECOND SOIR.

The focus is on their refraining from a greater imposition. The English translation \"but they were so honest as to be gone\" shifts this focus to the general act of their departure in the evening. While \"honest\" could mean \"decent\" in this period, the change from commending a specific act of forbearance (not overstaying) to praising the act of leaving slightly alters and simplifies Fontenelle's ironic social observation. It omits the specific context of what constituted the \"honnêteté\" (not staying overnight), thereby subtly diminishing the precision of the social commentary.","The French \"pourtant\" (however, yet) in \"Je n'ay pourtant jamais oüy parler...\" introduces the Marquise's statement as a polite contrast or gentle counterpoint to the philosopher's preceding remark that she would not be surprised by the idea of an inhabited Moon. It signals a qualification based on her prior experience. The English \"Truly\" primarily functions as an intensifier for her assertion (\"Indeed, I have never heard...\"), lacking the direct contrastive link to the philosopher's assumption. This subtly alters the dialogic flow, making the Marquise's response seem less like a direct, nuanced engagement with or qualification of the philosopher's point, and more like an independent declaration of her knowledge. This can slightly shift the perception of her active, critical role in the dialogue as intended by Fontenelle.","The French \"ménagemens\" in \"qu'on a des ménagemens avec ses Ennemis mêmes\" suggests cautious, diplomatic dealings, tact, or prudent handling of opponents, especially in a charged situation like a civil war. It implies a degree of finesse and careful self-preservation. The English translation \"and maintain an Intrigue with the very Enemy\" introduces a significantly stronger and more negative connotation of secret plotting, scheming, or duplicitous engagement. This substitution alters the tone of the philosopher's analogy, potentially recasting his intellectual caution from prudence and open-mindedness to something more calculating, manipulative, or morally ambiguous. In the context of late 17th-century England, with its history of civil war and contemporary political tensions (e.g., Jacobite plots), the word \"Intrigue\" would carry potent associations, potentially leading readers to view the philosopher's stance with more suspicion than Fontenelle's original phrasing suggests."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P022: Suposons qu'il n'y ait jamais eu nul commerce entre Paris &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Saint-Denis</span></span>, &amp; qu'un Bourgeois de Paris, qui ne sera jamais sorty de sa Ville, soit sur les Tours de Notre Dame, &amp; voye Saint-Denis de loin; on luy demandera s'il croit que Saint-Denis soit habité comme Paris.

The translation adds the parenthetical gloss '(a Town about three miles from Paris)' to 'St. Denis', providing explicit geographical information not present in the source. This addition, while potentially clarifying for a non-French audience, makes the analogy more concrete and specific than Fontenelle's more general framing. This shifts perception by removing the reliance on assumed knowledge and fixing a detail left open in the original.","The French 'quelqu'un' translates to 'someone,' an indefinite pronoun referring to any person who might offer a counter-argument. The English translation 'Some standerby' specifies this individual as a 'bystander,' implying someone physically present and observing the scene. This narrows the general nature of 'quelqu'un,' subtly altering the dynamic of the hypothetical debate by making the imagined interlocutor more specific than in the original text, thereby shifting the reader's perception of the scene.","The French 'mon Bourgeois' (my Bourgeois) uses a possessive as a narrative device to refer to the character in the analogy. The English translation 'my honest Burgess' introduces the adjective 'honest,' which is absent in the original. This addition attributes a specific character trait—such as sincerity, simplicity, or naivety—to the Bourgeois. This subtly alters the reader's perception of him from being primarily defined by his limited viewpoint and obstinacy to someone whose flawed reasoning might be seen as 'honest' but misguided, thereby changing the tone of his characterization."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P023: Ah! interrompit la Marquise, vous nous faites tort, nous ne sommes point si sots que votre Bourgeois.

This emphasizes humility born from realizing her prior unawareness. The translation \"of which I shall never make any doubt\" changes this into an assertion of her current and future firm conviction.

The English translation simplifies this to 'the solidity', omitting 'dureté' (hardness). This omission reduces the scientific-sounding precision or rhetorical emphasis of the original by removing one of the enumerated qualities, subtly altering the perceived thoroughness of the description of the Earth.","The French 'fournir de la pâture aux Animaux' (to provide pasture for Animals) is translated as the more specific 'to feed Cattel'. This substitution narrows the scope of Earth's perceived mundane function from benefiting animals in general to specifically benefiting cattle. This specificity could evoke a more particular agricultural image, potentially reflecting English rural concerns of the time, and subtly alters the generality of Fontenelle's statement, making Earth's utility seem more limited or tied to a particular form of animal husbandry.","The French 'Il faudroit être' (It would be necessary to be / One should be) expresses a condition required for objective observation. The English translation 'and better it would be' introduces a comparative judgment of desirability ('better' than the current state of being an inhabitant). This shifts the philosopher's tone from one emphasizing a methodological necessity for clear perspective to a more wistful or evaluative preference for detachment, subtly altering the nuance of the original statement.","The French source offers a very concise statement regarding the Moon's 'tremblement' (trembling/wavering) and its inhabitants' subsequent perception. The English translation significantly expands upon this by inserting a lengthy, detailed scientific explanation of synchronous rotation (why the Moon always shows the same face) and a more thorough description of libration ('wavering motion (motus libratorius)') before arriving at the inhabitants' likely interpretation. This substantial addition of scientific reasoning, largely absent in the provided French source segment at this specific juncture, manipulates the reader's understanding by presenting a text that appears more pedagogically complete and scientifically explicit than the source, potentially to cater to an audience keen on detailed scientific popularization."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P026: Toutes ces Planètes, dit la Marquise, sont faites comme nous, qui rejetons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mêmes.

In the context of the personified Moon denying a perceived physical motion, \"tremble\" is direct. \"Waver\" introduces an ambiguity, potentially subtly altering the Moon's denial by imbuing it with a psychological or moral dimension of lacking steadfastness not clearly present in the original physical sense.","The French \"erreur\" (error, mistake) is translated as \"faults.\" \"Faults\" often carries connotations of defect or moral failing, whereas \"erreur\" in this context refers to mistaken perceptions in astronomy. This subtly shifts the tone of the Marquise's observation from intellectual error to something with a potentially more judgmental or defect-based connotation, altering the reader's perception of the nature of these misapprehensions.","The French \"réformer\" generally means \"to reform\" or \"to correct.\" The English translation \"to attempt a Reformation\" (capitalized) in the late 17th-century English context strongly evokes the religious Protestant Reformation. This introduces a specific and potentially loaded religio-political connotation absent in Fontenelle's more general idea of correcting scientific misconceptions, significantly altering the tone by linking scientific correction to contemporary English religious and political debates.","The French phrase \"Il y a donc toûjours une moitié... qui est éclairée\" (So there is always one half... that is illuminated) describes a constant state. The translation \"Then the Sun daily enlightens one half\" changes \"toûjours\" (always) to \"daily,\" implying a recurring action by the Sun rather than a continuous state of illumination of a hemisphere. This shift subtly alters the scientific precision of the statement, focusing on cyclical experience rather than constant reality.","The French \"Nous n'avons garde de voir\" signifies \"We certainly do not see\" or \"We are far from seeing,\" indicating an observational impossibility or established fact. The translation \"We do not look to see\" alters this by implying a lack of human effort or intention (\"do not look\") rather than an objective constraint. This subtly shifts the reason for not seeing the unlit lunar half from natural phenomena to human choice or inaction.","The French \"en Décours\" refers to the astronomical phase of \"waning.\" The phrase \"nous sommes en Décours pour elles\" means \"we (the Earth) are in a waning phase for them (the Moon's inhabitants).\" The translation \"we are running from them\" completely changes this meaning. It replaces a scientific description of a celestial phase with an active, dynamic image of fleeing or moving away, which is not implied by the original and misrepresents the astronomical phenomenon being described, thus manipulating the reader's understanding of the science."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je saurai tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.

The English translation \"to have requir'd so minute an explication\" shifts the agency, implying she actively demanded or her understanding necessitated a very detailed (\"minute\") breakdown. This subtly alters the perception of her character and her engagement with the scientific explanation, potentially making her seem more demanding or perhaps suggesting a greater need for detailed instruction despite her claim that the topic is easy.","The French \"de le deviner\" (to guess it, to figure it out, to divine it) encourages an intuitive or deductive process, aligning with Fontenelle's aim to make science approachable and engaging. The English translation \"to judge\" implies a more formal, analytical cognitive act of assessment or forming a conclusion. This shift can alter the tone of the philosopher's interaction with the Marquise, making the invitation to reason seem more like a formal test of her intellectual capacity rather than a playful encouragement to deduce.","The French phrase \"noircit une partie de cette moitié lumineuse de la Terre\" (darkens a part of this luminous half of the Earth) accurately describes that the Moon's shadow covers only a portion of the Earth's sunlit side visible from the Moon during an eclipse. The English translation \"darkens all that luminous part of the Earth\" is a factual error, exaggerating the extent of the eclipse effect. This alteration misrepresents the scientific phenomenon being explained, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the astronomical concept.","The French phrase \"pendant le jour dont elle joüissait\" (during the day that it/she was enjoying) personifies the Moon and adds a literary charm by suggesting it experiences pleasure from its daytime. The English translation \"in her day\" is a neutral, factual rendering that completely omits the affective verb \"joüissait\" (was enjoying). This omission flattens Fontenelle's engaging popularizing style, which blends scientific explanation with literary appeal, and removes an element designed to make the cosmos feel more relatable and less abstract."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P028: Je suis fort étonnée, dit la Marquise, qu'il y ait si peu de mystere aux Eclipses, &amp; que tout le monde n'en devine pas la cause.

(a very suitable situation to obtain...) describes the perceived efficacy of the action neutrally from the practitioners' viewpoint. The translation 'as the most devout posture, in their opinion, to prevail...' introduces 'devout posture,' a specific religious characterization not explicit in the original, and 'in their opinion,' which adds a layer of overt subjectivity and distancing not present in Fontenelle's phrasing. This subtly manipulates the reader's perception by framing the indigenous practice through a more judgmental or externally categorized lens, potentially reflecting the translator's contemporary cultural or religious biases.","Fontenelle uses the specific feminine term 'Magiciennes' (female magicians/sorceresses). The translation uses the more general term 'Magicians,' which can be gender-neutral or imply males, thereby omitting the specific gender information present in the original. In a period where magic and witchcraft often had strong gender dimensions implicating women, and considering Fontenelle’s work was notably oriented towards a female audience, this generalization can subtly alter perception by neutralizing a potentially significant gender-specific element intended by the author.","The original French presents 'Une infinité de Gens ne se tinrent-ils pas enfermez dans des caves...' as a direct rhetorical question, reinforcing a point about widespread fear. The translation alters this to a subordinate clause 'When an infinite number of people shut themselves up in Caves...', changing the rhetorical structure and diminishing its independent emphatic force by making it a descriptive addition to the preceding question. Furthermore, the phrase 'pour nous rassurer' (to reassure us/alleviate our fears) is translated as 'to incourage us.' While related, 'reassure' is more specific to calming the fear of eclipses central to the context, whereas 'encourage' is broader. This combination of structural alteration and lexical shift subtly manipulates the emphasis and rhetorical style of Fontenelle's argument."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P029: En vérité, reprit-elle, tout cela est trop honteux pour les hommes, il devrait y avoir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">un Arrêt du Genre humain</span></span>, qui défendît qu'on parlât jamais d'Eclipses, de peur que l'on ne conserve la memoire des sotises qui ont été faites ou dites sur ce Chapitre là.

This subtly intensifies the critique of such adoration, making it seem more widespread and inherently irrational, thereby manipulating the reader's perception of these beliefs.","The French \"un peu d'esprit & d'habileté\" (a little wit and skill) is translated as \"but very little Wit and Ability.\" The addition of \"very\" intensifies the smallness of the amount of intelligence needed by the Moon's inhabitants to see through Earth's pretensions.

The translation \"in the World,\" while historically capable of meaning \"universe,\" is ambiguous and more commonly understood as referring to Earth. This potential narrowing of scope subtly alters the meaning by diminishing the cosmic scale of Fontenelle's speculation. Instead of suggesting foolishness is a trait found across the vast universe, the translation might imply it's merely widespread on Earth, thereby reducing the radical, speculative nature of the original statement.","The French phrase \"L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à être generalement répanduë\" translates to \"Ignorance is something very apt/suited/likely to be generally spread,\" which is an ironic observation on how easily ignorance proliferates. The English translation, \"Ignorance is a certain Good proper to be generally diffus'd,\" fundamentally changes this by asserting that ignorance itself is a \"Good\" (a positive entity or virtue). This introduces a moral valuation absent in the original text, distorting Fontenelle's Enlightenment perspective that championed knowledge over ignorance.

This subtly alters the portrayal of the Marquise's engagement in the dialogue. In Fontenelle's original, her interruptions often signify quick understanding, eagerness, or active participation. Removing this nuance makes her contribution in this instance appear less dynamic or assertive, potentially softening the depiction of her intellectual vivacity.","The French \"ces Savants\" (these/those learned men/scientists) uses a demonstrative pronoun (\"ces\") that points to a specific, identifiable group of contemporary observers making new astronomical discoveries. The translation \"the learned\" is more general and abstract. This change subtly depersonalizes the source of the \"certain news,\" shifting from information brought by specific, pioneering individuals to information brought by learned people as a category, potentially lessening the perception of the immediacy of the scientific claims.","The translation of \"de très hautes Montagnes\" (very high mountains) as \"mighty Mountains\" alters the tone and connotation. \"Très hautes\" is a relatively objective description of size. \"Mighty,\" while encompassing great size, also carries strong connotations of power, impressiveness, and grandeur not explicitly present in the French. This subtly shifts the characterization of the lunar mountains from a factual observation to a more awe-inspiring image, potentially enhancing their perceived extraordinariness beyond Fontenelle's more neutral description."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P033: Vous me surprenez, reprit-elle.

The English translation \"only too much Gayty\" functions as an idiomatic intensifier, meaning \"excessively much\" or \"very much\" gaiety. This change in phrasing exaggerates the degree of \"gaiety,\" subtly altering Fontenelle's more diplomatic and careful tone into a stronger, more emphatic characterization of the license's perceived flaw. This could be significant given the religious sensitivities of the period.","The translator adds \"Mountains\" to the list of geographical features found on the Moon as described by Astolphus from Ariosto's tale. The original French text lists \"d'autres fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts\" (other rivers, other lakes, other towns, other forests). This addition of \"Mountains\" is an unsolicited piece of information not present in the source, thereby subtly altering the reader's perception of the lunar landscape by making it appear more geographically diverse or rugged than Fontenelle conveyed.","The French term \"un Vallon\" translates to \"a vale\" or, more precisely, \"a small valley\" (as \"vallon\" is often a diminutive of \"val\"). The English translation renders this as \"a great Vale.\" The addition of the adjective \"great\" significantly changes the perceived scale of the valley where lost things are found on the Moon. This exaggeration transforms the original imagery from a potentially modest or normal-sized valley into a large, imposing one, an alteration unsupported by the source text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune.

Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie. Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres bien conservé.

Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, &amp; qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, &amp; sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune. Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà. Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut.

Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable.

Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable. When we go to some Lands newly discover'd, we find the Inhabitants scarce Men; they are a sort of Animals in humane shape, and sometime imperfect enough, but <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">almost wholly without reason</span></span>: therefore surely he that should go on to the Moon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">would not find them Men at all</span></span>.</p>","explanations":["The French 'ont prétendu être Maîtres' (claimed/professed/pretended to be Masters) is translated as 'pretended themselves Masters'. The English reflexive construction 'pretended themselves X' more strongly emphasizes a false or presumptuous self-representation than the French 'prétendu être' necessarily implies on its own. In the anti-Catholic socio-political context of England during James II's reign, this phrasing subtly intensifies Fontenelle's existing skepticism about the Donation of Constantine, potentially portraying Papal claims as more actively self-aggrandizing and deceitful to resonate with the English audience.","The original French 'presque sans aucune raison humaine' translates to 'almost without any human reason'. The English translation 'almost wholly without reason' manipulates this in two ways: firstly, by omitting 'humaine' (human), it removes the specific qualification that the reason lacking is *human* reason, thereby broadening the statement to a more general and absolute lack of reason. Secondly, the use of 'wholly' (in 'almost wholly') acts as an intensifier, making the lack of reason seem more complete or entire than 'presque sans aucune' (almost without any). This combined change subtly alters Fontenelle's description, making the inhabitants of newly discovered lands appear more primitive and further removed from normative humanity than depicted in the source text.","Fontenelle's French 'ce ne seroient plus des Hommes' means 'they would no longer be Men' or 'it would no longer be Men,' suggesting that beings found on the Moon would be so different they would have departed from or transcended the category of 'Man' as understood. The English translation, 'would not find them Men at all,' uses the strong intensifier 'at all.' This shifts the meaning from 'no longer Men' (implying a change or divergence from a category) to 'not Men whatsoever' (implying a complete absence of the characteristics defining 'Men'). This subtly hardens Fontenelle's assertion, portraying the alienness of lunar beings in more absolute terms."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience?

The omission of the adjective \"bizarre\" (bizarre/strange) significantly softens Fontenelle's critical and astonished tone when describing humanity's contradictory nature from a detached, hypothetical perspective. This change diminishes the satirical force of the observation and presents a less peculiar image of humankind to the reader.","The French \"incessamment\" (incessantly, constantly) indicates a continuous and relentless self-observation. The translation to \"daily\" reduces the frequency and intensity of this action. This alteration subtly changes the portrayal of humanity's self-contemplation from a perpetual, possibly obsessive, state to a more routine occurrence, thereby lessening the impact of Fontenelle's philosophical point about human self-scrutiny.","The French expression \"On a eté réduit à dire\" (One has been reduced to saying / People have been driven to say) suggests that the subsequent explanation (about Gods making Men while full of Nectar) is a conclusion reached out of necessity or as a last resort, implying a failure of other, more rational explanations for human nature. The English translation \"It made some say\" is more passive and anecdotal, removing the nuance of intellectual desperation or reluctant concession present in the original. This shift subtly alters the reader's perception of how such mythological explanations arise, downplaying the implied critique of their basis.","The French text states two distinct areas of ignorance regarding the inhabitants of the other end of the metaphorical ship: \"quelles Gens sont à l'autre\" (what/which people are at the other end) and \"ny ce qu'ils y font\" (nor what they are doing there). The English translation \"what sort of people are in the other\" addresses the nature or type of people but omits the second distinct element of ignorance concerning their actions (\"ny ce qu'ils y font\"). This omission narrows the scope of the confessed ignorance, making the analogy about the limits of human knowledge and understanding of distant 'others' (like lunar inhabitants) less comprehensive than in Fontenelle's original text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant.

Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">de Monstres qui courent sous eux</span></span>, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">vous êtes fou.</span></span> Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien.

Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune.

If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it. Ah! says the Marchioness, you now give me some comfort; your fallacious reasoning made me sick.

I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth.</span></span> I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">those Monsters that ran upon the Sea</span></span>, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">you are a Fool.</span></span> Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">said I, ready to laugh</span></span>, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">said the Marchioness</span></span> looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">and that even not without producing all its proofs,</span></span> it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it.

The English translation restructures this, making the parenthetical 'I know not how I got it' refer to the origin of the thought itself rather than its surprising plausibility. This subtly shifts the focus from the nature of the thought's plausibility to the origin of the thought, altering the introspective nuance of the philosopher's reflection.","The French 'Monstres qui courent sous eux' refers to the horses ridden by the conquistadors ('monsters running beneath them'). The translation 'Monsters that ran upon the Sea' incorrectly depicts these creatures as sea-faring, altering the visual and factual accuracy of the description of the arrival of Europeans in America. This distorts the image Fontenelle is creating.","The French 'vous êtes fou' implies 'you are mad/crazy,' often in the sense of being wildly imaginative or irrational, which fits the context of discussing far-fetched ideas. The English translation 'you are a Fool' shifts the connotation more towards being silly, unwise, or lacking judgement. This subtly alters the tone of the Marquise's exclamation, making it less about the extravagance of the philosopher's idea and more about a perceived lack of sense in him.","The French 'en éclatant de rire' means 'bursting out laughing,' indicating a strong, spontaneous display of amusement from the philosopher. The translation 'ready to laugh' significantly tones down this reaction to a mere preparedness or slight inclination to laugh. This alters the character's expressed emotion and the intensity of the dialogue, subtly changing the reader's perception of the philosopher's demeanor.","The translator has erroneously taken the phrase 'Sans mentir' (Truly / Without lying), which belongs to the Marquise's subsequent speech in the original French, and appended a translation of it ('without lying') to the end of the philosopher's sentence. This incorrectly attributes the phrase to the philosopher, alters his statement by adding a moral qualifier that was not originally there, and omits his original concluding words 'les Gens de la Lune' (the People of the Moon) at this specific point.","Consequent to the misplacement described in the previous point (where 'Sans mentir' was incorrectly added to the philosopher's line), the Marquise's emphatic opening phrase 'Sans mentir,' (meaning 'Truly,' or 'Without lying,' and indicating sincerity or emphasis) is omitted from the beginning of her dialogue in the English translation. The target segment 'said the Marchioness' reflects the start of her speech, now lacking this initial expressive phrase, thereby removing a characteristic element of her speech and slightly weakening the perceived force of her subsequent observation.","The French 'même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves' states that truth persuades 'even without needing to appear with all its proofs.' The English translation 'and that even not without producing all its proofs' reverses this meaning. It suggests that truth persuades 'not without' (i.e., by requiring) the production of all its proofs. This significantly alters a key philosophical assertion about the nature of truth and its inherent persuasiveness, a subtle but important shift in an Enlightenment text concerned with new ways of knowing."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">TROISIEME SOIR.

Translating this as \"Entertainments\" shifts the connotation towards amusement or light diversion. While \"entertainment\" historically had broader meanings, its choice here, over more direct terms like \"conversations\" or \"discourses,\" subtly downplays the serious scientific and philosophical substance of Fontenelle's dialogues. This change in tone could make the work seem less intellectually weighty, potentially reframing novel scientific ideas as a harmless pastime, especially in a socio-cultural context where such ideas could be controversial.","The French plural \"nos Conversations savantes\" (our learned conversations) suggests multiple distinct discussions or a variety of learned topics. The translation to the singular \"our learned Conversation\" could be interpreted as referring to the general activity of learned discussion rather than specific, numerous instances. This shift from plural to singular subtly diminishes the expressed multiplicity or extensiveness of these learned exchanges, potentially causing the reader to perceive the intellectual engagement as less frequent, less varied, or less substantial than the original French implies."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences êtoit habitée, pourroit bien ne l'être point; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril. Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">&amp; voilà le malheur.</span></span> A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur.</span></span> Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune; conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres</span></span>, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">ou produit par des causes étrangeres</span></span>, voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.

The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe.

Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud</span></span>. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her.

Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not.

The translation incorrectly makes the subsequent clause refer to \"it\" (the Moon – \"the more subtil parts of it\"), stating that the Moon's subtle parts easily disengage. This reversal fundamentally alters Fontenelle's scientific reasoning, which contrasts the Moon's supposed solidity with Earth's known properties (whose parts do disengage). The error manipulates the reader's understanding by presenting a flawed version of the scientific argument.","The French phrase \"les unes auprès des autres\" describes constituent parts of a mass as being \"next to each other\" or \"alongside each other,\" depicting a static spatial arrangement. The translation \"one after the other\" incorrectly suggests a sequential or linear arrangement. This mistranslation subtly alters the philosopher's description of the hypothetical static internal structure of the Moon he is arguing against, potentially confusing the reader about the physical nature of the hypothesis being refuted.","The French \"ou produit par des causes étrangeres\" means \"or produced by external/foreign causes,\" presenting one of two hypothetical causes of motion in the Moon. The English translation inserts the word \"found,\" resulting in the awkward phrase \"or produc'd found by foreign causes.\" If interpreted as \"produced by foreign causes [and this has been] found,\" it adds an unwarranted epistemic claim of discovery or verification to what Fontenelle presents as a mere possibility. This subtly manipulates the reader by potentially elevating the certainty or observational basis of this hypothetical cause beyond the original's intent."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P041: C'est-à-dire, me dit la Marquise, que vous savez seulement que tout est bien, sans savoir comment il est; c'est beaucoup d'ignorance sur bien peu de science; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">mais il faut s'en consoler;</span></span> je suis encore trop heureuse que vous ayez rendu à la Lune ses Habitans.

The English 'but we must be content;' implies a more passive acceptance or satisfaction. This subtly alters the tone, making the Marquise's reflection on the limits of knowledge seem less profound or less affected by her acknowledged ignorance.","The translation alters meaning and flow. French 'que vous luy donniez' (that you give/attribute to her) becomes 'that you allow,' a more passive term changing the philosopher's role. 'Un Air qui l'enveloppe en son particulier,' (an atmosphere that envelops it specifically,) is simplified to 'her Air to cover her;', weakening 'enveloppe' (envelops) to 'cover' and omitting the crucial specificity of 'en son particulier' (specifically for it).

This adds a layer of emphasis that could slightly shift the reader's perception of the factors involved.","In the phrase \"si on ne volera pas fort bien quelque jour\" (meaning \"if one day we will fly *very well*,\" with an expletive \"ne\"), the adverb \"fort bien\" (very well) is translated as \"well enough\" in the corresponding English phrase \"we may fly well enough.\" This change from \"very well\" to \"well enough\" subtly diminishes the degree of proficiency or success implied in Fontenelle's optimistic speculation about future flight, thereby altering the original nuance.","The French \"a pour prison\" (has for a prison), as in \"chacun a pour prison l'air qu'il respire\" (each has for a prison the air he breathes), employs a strong and evocative metaphor. The English translation \"is confin'd to,\" as in \"each of them is confin'd to his own Air,\" significantly weakens this metaphor by replacing the vivid image of entrapment with the more neutral and common term \"confin'd.\" This alters the tone, making it less dramatic and reducing the literary vividness of Fontenelle's original expression.","The original French \"tomber mort sur la Terre\" (fall dead on the Earth) is rendered as \"tumble down dead before us.\" The verb \"tumble down\" is more colloquial and graphic than the simpler \"tomber\" (fall). More significantly, the addition of \"before us\" is not present in the French text (which states \"sur la Terre,\" meaning \"on the Earth\"); this addition makes the imagined scene more immediate and personal to the observers (the narrator and the Marquise, and by extension, the reader), subtly shifting the narrative perspective and intensifying the dramatic impact beyond the original's phrasing."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P043: Oh, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">que j'aurois d'envie</span></span>, s'écria la Marquise, qu'il arrivât quelque grand naufrage qui <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">répandît icy</span></span> bon nombre de ces Gens- là, dont nous irions considérer à notre aise les figures extraordinaires!

The translation \"how I should rejoyce\" shifts this to a stronger, more overtly positive, and perhaps more certain future reaction of joy. \"Rejoyce\" (se réjouir) is a more intense and demonstrative emotion than the \"envie\" (desire, longing) expressed in the original. This subtly alters the tone of the Marquise's exclamation, making her reaction sound more emphatically joyful and potentially less whimsical than Fontenelle's phrasing might imply.","The French \"répandît icy\" (from répandre - to spread, scatter here), in the context of a shipwreck, suggests a chaotic and uncontrolled distribution of the imagined alien beings. The translation \"lay before us\" implies a more ordered, contained, and static presentation, as if the aliens are being exhibited for consideration. This subtly alters the imagery, softening the chaotic nature of the imagined event (\"grand naufrage\") and making the scene more akin to a curated observation rather than the immediate aftermath of a disaster.","The translator adds the specific fishing implements \"Nets and Hooks\" to the philosopher's dialogue. The original French, \"ils nous pêchassent comme des Poissons\" (they fished us like Fish), is more general. While the Marquise later mentions \"Filets\" (Nets) in the original (\"dans leurs Filets\"), by having the philosopher introduce \"Nets\" (and adding \"Hooks\" entirely), the translation pre-empts the Marquise's specific imagery. In the original, her mention of \"Nets\" can be seen as her own imaginative specification of the general concept of being \"fished.\" In the translation, she merely echoes a term (\"Nets\") already supplied by the philosopher, and the philosopher's speech is made more graphically detailed with the addition of \"Hooks.\" This subtly diminishes the Marquise's agency in contributing unique imagery to the conversation at this point and makes the philosopher's initial hypothetical scenario more concrete than in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P044: Songez, répliquai-je, que vous n'arriveriez que bien malade au haut de notre Air, il n'est pas respirable pour nous dans toute son étenduê, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">il s'en faut bien</span></span>, il ne l'est déjà presque plus au haut de certaines Montagnes, &amp; je m'étonne bien que ceux qui ont la folie de croire que des Genies corporels habitent l'air le plus pur, ne disent aussi que ce qui fait que ces Genies ne nous rendent que des visites &amp; tres-rares &amp; très-courtes, c'est qu'il y en a peu d'entre eux qui sachent plonger, &amp; que ceux-là même ne peuvent faire jusqu'au fond de cet air épais, où nous sommes, que des plongeons de très peu de durée.

The English \"it must needs be so\" shifts this to an affirmation of the truth of the statement \"we cannot breath in all its extent,\" rather than emphasizing the degree to which it is unbreathable. This alters the nuance from an emphasis on extent/degree to an emphasis on certainty of the fact.","The French \"bien des barrieres\" means \"many\" or \"a lot of\" natural barriers, indicating an unspecified number. The translation to \"three natural Barricades\" introduces a specific number not present in the original. This addition of unwarranted specificity makes the philosopher's argument seem more itemized or concretely defined than Fontenelle intended, potentially misleading the reader to search for exactly three points.","The French \"pour notre consolation\" suggests that guessing about the Moon serves as a comfort or solace for the inability to visit it, implying a slightly wistful or philosophical motive. The English \"for our satisfaction\" translates this into a more direct and less emotional motivation of fulfilling curiosity or a desire for knowledge, thereby changing the original tone and the perceived purpose of the speculation.","The French \"il faut que\" (it is necessary that, one must) expresses a strong likelihood or logical deduction. The English translation \"that we might see\" reduces this assertion to mere possibility. This significantly weakens the philosopher's claim about the differing appearance of celestial bodies from the Moon, changing the original's argumentative force from a reasoned conclusion to a more tentative speculation.","The French \"prétendent que\" translates to \"claim that\" or \"maintain that,\" a relatively neutral term for presenting a hypothesis. In English, \"pretend\" can carry a stronger connotation of falsehood or make-believe, especially for a general readership even in that period, beyond simply \"to assert a claim.\" This word choice can subtly cast more doubt on the scientific theories of the \"Moderns\" than Fontenelle's original term, potentially manipulating the reader's perception of these new ideas by suggesting they are less credible, particularly in a socio-cultural context of tension between emerging science and established orthodoxies.","The French \"qui nous doit alterer\" (which must alter for us / which is bound to alter for us) conveys a sense of logical necessity or an inevitable consequence derived from the preceding analogy (air as fog). The English translation \"that changes\" simplifies this to a factual statement, losing the original's emphasis on the alteration being a necessary outcome. This weakens the deductive or causal strength of the argument.","This entire French sentence, which means \"It would only belong to celestial matter to bring us light and colors in all their purity, and as they are,\" is omitted in the English translation. The target segment is empty as the corresponding text is absent. This omission removes a key philosophical counterpoint where Fontenelle posits an ideal medium for true perception (\"matière céleste\") against the reality of altered perception through Earth's (and potentially the Moon's) atmosphere. This significantly shifts the reader's understanding by removing a layer of Fontenelle's speculation on absolute versus relative perception.","The French \"une autre alteration\" means \"another alteration\" or \"a different alteration.\" This implies that the Moon's air, being of a different nature, would cause a qualitatively different kind of visual change. The English translation \"that change\" is more generic, referring simply to the phenomenon of color alteration previously discussed in the context of Earth's air. This erases the specific implication that the Moon's inhabitants would experience a *distinctly different* visual distortion, not just any distortion, thereby subtly altering the meaning."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau</span></span> qu'il l'est icy.

The English \"the Appearance of the celestial colours\" focuses on the superficial look, while \"so pleasant\" is a weaker aesthetic term. This combined shift subtly diminishes the Marquise's sophisticated engagement, altering her concern from one of artistry and profound beauty to a simpler preference for general pleasantness.","The French \"a bien de l'esprit\" personifies Nature with wit and creative ingenuity. The English \"Nature understands well enough what she does\" reduces this to mere competence, diminishing the original's literary charm and the vividness of Nature's personified creative force, thereby subtly altering the reader's perception of Nature's character from active brilliance to adequate understanding.","The French \"qu'il sera bien entendu\" implies Nature's creation will be intrinsically \"well-conceived\" or \"harmonious.\" The English \"it shall be well approved\" shifts the criterion for success from this inherent quality to external validation by observers. This subtly manipulates the reader by emphasizing human judgment over Nature's intrinsic artistry.","The French \"le Spectacle de l'Univers\" suggests a grand, unified, and artistically coherent display. The English \"variety of Prospects in the Universe\" fragments this into multiple, potentially less awe-inspiring views. This translation choice lessens the original's sense of grandeur, subtly altering the reader's perception of the universe from a singular, impressive whole to a collection of diverse scenes.","The original French \"& de le varier d'une manière toûjours agreable\" states that Nature varies the spectacle in an always agreeable manner, implying an inherent harmony. The translation \"and yet the variety is still pleasing\" introduces a concessive tone (\"and yet...still\"), suggesting the agreeableness is achieved despite the variation, a nuance absent in the original. This subtly alters the perception of Nature's design from effortlessly harmonious to conditionally pleasing."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P046: Je reconnois son <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">adresse</span></span>, interrompit la Marquise, elle s'est épargné la peine de changer les objets pour chaque point de veûe, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">elle n'a changé que les Lunettes</span></span>, &amp; elle a l'honneur de cette grande diversité, sans en avoir fait la dépense.

While 'artifice' can denote skill, its more common connotation, particularly in the 17th-18th century, also carried strong implications of cunning, trickery, or a man-made device intended to deceive. This shifts the tone, potentially portraying 'Nature' (the 'elle' referred to) as more of a cunning trickster rather than merely skillful or ingenious, subtly altering the reader's perception.","The French 'Lunettes' most commonly refers to 'spectacles' or 'eyeglasses,' providing a concrete and accessible metaphor for individual perceptual filters. The translation to 'Perspectives' (capitalized) likely refers either to 'perspective glasses' (an archaic term for optical instruments like telescopes/spyglasses) or more abstractly to 'viewpoints.' The former changes the type of instrument in the metaphor from an everyday item to a more specialized one; the latter makes the metaphor more abstract, losing the concrete imagery of an optical device. Both interpretations alter the specific character and familiarity of Fontenelle's original metaphor.","The French 'changent fort les objets' means 'strongly change' or 'change greatly.' The omission of the intensifier 'fort' (strongly, greatly) in the translation 'which change the Objects' significantly weakens the original statement. This downplays the asserted power of individual perception or imagination to alter the appearance of objects, thus shifting the reader's understanding of the extent of this transformation.","The French uses the imperfect tense 'voyoit' for Celadon, consistent with 'Alexandre voyoit,' grouping both as illustrative viewpoints rooted in past or established contexts, contrasting with the philosopher's present tense 'voit.' The translation changes Celadon's verb to the present tense 'sees,' aligning him with the philosopher. This alteration subtly shifts Celadon's romanticized literary perspective from being a somewhat historicized or archetypal example to an equally current mode of perception as the philosopher's, changing the dynamics of the comparison."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, répliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mêmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

The translation 'to beat down the Rays' introduces a more forceful, almost violent connotation not present in the original, subtly altering the tone of the scientific description.","The Marquise's original statement 'Je n'aurois pas grand regret' (I would not have much regret), expressed in a polite conditional tense suggesting a considered, hypothetical feeling, is translated to the more direct and emotionally detached 'I am not much concern'd.' This alters her expressed sentiment and tone from nuanced regret to a more assertive lack of interest, subtly changing her characterization.","The general French phrase 'sur la tête' (on one's head / on the head) is translated with the gender-specific 'over a mans head.' This addition of 'a mans' unnecessarily masculinizes a universal statement, which subtly manipulates perception, especially considering Fontenelle's known intention to make science accessible to women.","The original French makes a clear, declarative statement about lunar topography: 'car ce ne sont point des Vallées qui soient entre des Montagnes' (for they are not Valleys that are between Mountains). The translation 'for they are not mountains?' fundamentally alters this by (a) incorrectly changing the subject of the negation from 'Valleys' to 'mountains' and (b) turning a definitive statement into a question.

The translation \"We may then expect to see\" softens this to a more conditional possibility or a gentler expectation, subtly diminishing the forcefulness of her remark and her conviction.","The translation manipulates the original in two ways within this short clause: first, by changing \"apparemment\" (apparently/seemingly) to \"'tis certain,\" it removes the original's note of conjecture and presents the idea with an unmerited degree of certainty. Second, the phrase \"as to their Paradice\" is an addition by the translator, introducing a specific religious concept and interpretation of Earth's role for these souls that is not present in Fontenelle's original, more speculative wording.","The original \"ramper\" (to crawl) evokes a slow, laborious, and somewhat demeaning form of movement, emphasizing the baseness of earthly travel. The translation \"to run,\" while still implying effort (\"take the pains\"), changes this image to a more active and less pathetic one, thereby weakening Fontenelle's intended sharp contrast between mundane earth-bound exploration and the grander imaginative voyage to other worlds.","The French \"je reprens le Saint-Denis\" is likely a witty, metaphorical statement by the philosopher, alluding to the legend of Saint Denis carrying his own head, possibly meaning \"I pick up my train of thought with renewed vigor\" or \"I tackle this new subject with fresh impetus.\" The literal translation \"I return again to Saint Denis\" renders this probable allusion opaque or nonsensical to an English reader, as if the philosopher is referring to a literal return to a person or place named Saint Denis. This changes the philosopher's voice from sophisticated and playful to potentially obscure, altering the original tone.","The original French \"Ciron\" (an archaic term for a mite) is singular and marks a specific threshold in the scale of visibility. The translation changes this to \"the Mite and the Cicon,\" introducing an additional, possibly obscure or erroneous term (\"Cicon\") alongside \"Mite.\" This expansion alters Fontenelle's precise zoological reference. Furthermore, while the new multitude of animals is said to begin \"from the Mite and the Cicon,\" the subsequent analogy (\"to which the Mite is an Elephant\") only refers back to the Mite, creating an inconsistency not present in the original and potentially confusing the reader about Fontenelle's scale.","The French \"de nouvelles especes\" (new species, plural) emphasizes the emergence of multiple new kinds of microorganisms, aligning with Fontenelle's broader theme of the teeming, diverse nature of life, including the invisible. The translation \"a new species\" (singular) subtly reduces this sense of multiplicity and diversity, limiting the scope of the observation in a way not intended by the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut.

The English translation \"may be a World inhabited\" reduces this to a mere possibility, weakening the persuasive force of the philosopher's argument. This subtly alters the tone, making Fontenelle's proposition about inhabited planets seem more speculative and less confidently asserted than in the original, which could manipulate the reader's perception of the strength of this then-revolutionary idea.","The French \"qui y connaissent des Montagnes & des Abîmes\" (who know/are familiar with mountains and abysses there) implies that the microscopic \"Vermisseaux\" (worms) possess a level of awareness and established understanding of their environment. The English translation \"there they find Mountains and Abysses\" shifts the meaning to merely encountering or discovering these features. This change subtly lessens the implied cognitive complexity and the inhabitants' established relationship with their environment, which Fontenelle uses by analogy to argue for complex life on other planets, thereby slightly weakening the philosophical impact of his argument for sophisticated extraterrestrial life.","The French \"qu'elle ne s'est pas mise en peine que l'on en vît seulement la moitié\" (that she didn't trouble herself that one saw *only* half of them) uses \"seulement\" (only/merely) to emphasize the vastness of unseen nature. It suggests Nature's indifference even if a seemingly significant portion like \"half\" were perceived, implying the unperceived part is far greater. The English translation \"that she never took care that half of them should be seen\" omits the explicit restrictive emphasis of \"seulement\". This omission lessens the rhetorical impact of the original statement, subtly altering the reader's perception of the sheer scale of Nature's unseen fecundity that Fontenelle aims to convey, a concept central to the emerging Enlightenment view of an infinitely complex universe independent of human observation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P051: Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë, dit la Marquise, mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planètes, &amp; embarrassée de la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux; car je voy bien que la Nature, selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela?

The English translation \"we may yet find\" replaces this with a statement of mere possibility (\"may find\"). This shift in modality weakens the original implication, changing a perceived requirement or a further essential stage of inquiry into a more speculative or optional prospect, thereby subtly altering the certainty and force of the philosopher's reasoning about discovering Nature's patterns.","The French \"Quel secret doit avoir eu la Nature\" (What secret must Nature have had) uses \"doit avoir eu,\" expressing a strong inference or logical necessity about a secret that Nature possessed in the past to achieve variation. The English \"What secret should Nature have\" employs \"should,\" which typically suggests advisability, expectation, or a weaker probability, and lacks the same strong past-tense certainty.

The translation \"'Tis most certain\" transforms this into a statement of definite fact, altering Fontenelle's cautious tone to one of assertion and potentially manipulating the reader into accepting the idea with less critical distance.","The French 'On dit' (one says/it is said), introducing the idea of a missing sixth sense, suggests a general, possibly informal notion. The translation 'It has been thought' elevates this to a more formal or considered intellectual position, subtly changing the perceived origin and authority of the speculation.","In the phrase 'Ce sixiéme Sens est apparemment dans quelque autre Monde', the French 'apparemment' (apparently, seemingly, probably) again indicates likelihood or educated guess. The translation 'that sixth Sense is doubtless in some other World' uses 'doubtless', which conveys near certainty, strengthening the assertion beyond Fontenelle's more speculative phrasing and potentially leading the reader to perceive the idea as more established.","The French phrase 'que l'Esprit humain n'a jamais pû passer' (that the human mind has never been able to pass), describing the limits of human science/knowledge, is a statement about past experience (passé composé). The translation 'which the Mind of Man cannot exceed' implies a present or general inherent inability (present tense with modal 'can'). This shift alters the nature of the limitation from an observed historical boundary to a more definitive, possibly permanent, one.","In the clause 'elle est toûjours desolée en plusieurs de ses parties par les fureurs de la Guerre,' the French 'toûjours' (always) signifies the continuous or perpetual nature of war's desolation on Earth. This word is absent in the corresponding part of the translation 'but in many parts is laid desolate by the fury of War'. This omission downplays the constancy of war's impact as described by Fontenelle, shifting the reader's perception of this planet's condition.","The French 'on s'ennuye' (one becomes bored/experiences ennui) describes a specific state of listless dissatisfaction and weariness experienced by inhabitants of a planet with perpetual peace but no love. The translation 'are uneasie' (uneasy) suggests anxiety, discomfort, or general restlessness. This changes the nature of the inhabitants' dissatisfaction, replacing the specific concept of ennui with a more general negative feeling, thus altering the philosophical nuance of their condition.","In the phrase 'il y a un point où elles nous manquent tout à coup,' the French 'tout à coup' (suddenly, all at once) emphasizes the abruptness with which human sciences/knowledge fail. The translation 'there is a certain point where it wholly fails us' uses 'wholly,' which emphasizes the completeness or totality of the failure. This shift in emphasis alters the reader's understanding of how these limits of knowledge are encountered, from a sudden halt to a complete one at that point."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux?

This choice, likely invoking the more common meaning of 'plain' (simplicity, openness) over an archaic, rarer sense of 'plan' (scheme), subtly downplays the structured, intellectual nature of the conceptual framework provided by the philosopher, altering the perception of Fontenelle's method of popularizing complex scientific ideas.","The French 'tout-à-fait bizarres' (completely/entirely bizarre) is rendered as 'strange and extravagant.' The addition of 'extravagant,' which can imply exceeding reasonable limits or lacking foundation, intensifies the original. This subtly shifts the perception of the Marquise's imaginings towards potentially excessive fancy rather than just 'completely odd,' impacting the balance between imagination and reasoned speculation characteristic of Fontenelle's work.","The French 'comment sont faits les Habitants' (how the inhabitants are made/what they are like), which implies their overall constitution, nature, and characteristics, is translated as 'the Shape of the Inhabitants.' This significantly narrows the scope of imaginative speculation to mere physical form, omitting broader philosophical considerations about the nature of extraterrestrial beings, which is a key element of Fontenelle's explorations."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P054: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">QUATRIEME SOIR.

The translation 'what we had seen,' shifts this reference to the specific past experiences of the characters ('we'). This subtly alters the meaning by personalizing the standard of comparison and moving it from a general, present observation about the earthly environment ('here') to a specific, past recollection, thereby slightly changing the perceived nature of the limitation on imagination.","The French 'Voyage des Mondes' (Voyage/Journey of the Worlds) explicitly highlights the exploration of multiple planets, a central and revolutionary theme of Fontenelle's work, which is titled 'Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds.' The translation 'Voyage... about the World' (singular) omits the plural. This subtly diminishes the emphasis on the 'plurality' of worlds, potentially shifting the reader's perception away from the specific, radical idea of many other distinct worlds to a more general cosmological journey, thereby slightly altering the impact of this core concept."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Vous m'affligez</span></span>, dit la Marquise.

The English 'You vex me' is milder, suggesting annoyance or worry rather than deep distress. This subtly lessens the emotional intensity of the Marquise's reaction.","The French 'une Planete qui soit jolie' (a planet that is pretty/lovely) is translated as 'a little Planet that is brisk'. This manipulation occurs in two ways: 'jolie' (pretty) is effectively replaced by 'brisk' (energetic, lively), changing the primary attribute from aesthetic charm to dynamism. Concurrently, the adjective 'little' is inserted to describe the Planet, adding a dimension of size not explicitly present in the source phrase 'Planete qui soit jolie', thereby altering the reader's perception of the planet.","The French 'presider aux Amours' (to preside over the Loves) implies a role of authority, governance, or leading proceedings. The translation 'to influence the Loves' significantly weakens this, suggesting a more indirect, softer, and less authoritative effect of the Moon, thus altering the perceived agency of the Moon.","The French 'le menu Peuple' means 'the common people' or 'ordinary folk,' referring to social standing. The translation 'the little people,' while historically able to mean commoners, more strongly evokes physical smallness in modern understanding and even in some period usage, potentially shifting the reader's perception of Venusians towards being physically diminutive rather than simply socially common.","The French 'valent les plus belles' (are equal to the most beautiful/finest) is translated as 'is beyond the most polite.' This manipulates the meaning in two ways: 'valent' (are equal to) is changed to 'is beyond' (is superior to), exaggerating the quality of the conversations. Secondly, 'belles' (beautiful/finest), referring to overall quality and charm, is narrowed to 'polite,' changing the nature of the excellence attributed to the conversations.","The original French 'une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur' describes two distinct effects: 'a more lively light' AND 'more heat' (as a separate quantity). The translation 'a Light more lively and hot' conjoins 'hot' as an adjective directly modifying 'Light.' This subtly alters the description by implying the light itself possesses the quality of being hot, rather than there being an additional, separate increase in ambient heat from the Sun."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, interrompit la Marquise, comment sont faits les Habitans de Vénus.

This subtly diminishes the depiction of their ingenuity and the dynamic, ever-renewing nature of their social life as portrayed by Fontenelle.","The original French 'pour la froideur & pour la stupidité.' attributes these characteristics to the Moors of Granada in a comparative sense, implying these qualities are evident when contrasted with the hyper-vivacious Venusians. The English translation adds the phrase 'of their Temper,' which is absent in the source. This addition reframes these negative traits as inherent and dispositional to the Moors, rather than relative or observational.

This cultural substitution localizes a general concept to a specific, historically-charged English institution, potentially evoking stronger or different connotations for the English reader than the original French phrase, thereby manipulating perception by anchoring it to a well-known local reference.","The French \"toute l'adresse des Astronomes\" signifies that Mercury eludes \"all the skill/cleverness/ingenuity of Astronomers.\" The translation \"all observation of Astronomers\" simplifies this, implying the planet merely escapes being seen rather than actively thwarting skilled efforts. This subtly diminishes the challenge faced by astronomers and their active agency, altering the perception of their scientific endeavor.","The French \"apparemment\" (apparently, seemingly) indicates a deduction or likelihood based on the preceding arguments. The translation \"'tis certain\" converts this speculation into a definitive statement of fact. This change in epistemic modality manipulates the reader by presenting a hypothesis as an established truth, altering the perceived reliability and source of the information.","The French phrase \"il doit y en avoir beaucoup qui disparoissent entierement\" (there must be many that disappear entirely) uses the modal verb \"doit\" (must) to convey a logical inference or strong probability.

This changes the direct object of the action from the planet to its inhabitants, subtly shifting the focus of the Marquise's imaginative intervention from the environment to the beings within it, thereby altering the precise meaning of her statement.","The French phrase describing the inhabitants' experience as \"l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de chaleur\" (the inconvenience/discomfort they receive from the excess of heat) is translated with intensified meaning as \"the inconveniences they suffer by the extremity of Heat.\" The verb \"reçoivent\" (receive) is replaced by the stronger \"suffer,\" and \"l'excés de chaleur\" (excess of heat) is rendered as the more dramatic \"the extremity of Heat.\" This combination subtly alters the tone, making the inhabitants' situation seem more dire than conveyed in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P060: Cela se peut, repris-je, &amp; même nous pouvons rafraîchir encore Mercure d'une autre façon.

This shifts the source of the remedy from Mercury's inherent properties to the Sun's own action, subtly altering Fontenelle's scientific explanation of planetary self-regulation.","The French 'au mal qu'il luy pourroit faire' means 'for the harm that it (the Sun) could/might do to it (Mercury)', indicating a potential or hypothetical harm ('pourroit' is conditional). The English translation 'for the evil that it caused' changes this to a harm that the Sun has already definitively inflicted (past tense). This alters the nature of the threat from a possibility to a certainty, and from future/potential to past/actual.","The French phrase 'les y fait vivre agréablement' means 'makes them live there pleasantly/comfortably'. The English translation 'makes them live there well enough' significantly diminishes the quality of life, suggesting a merely adequate or tolerable existence rather than a pleasant one. This change in connotation manipulates the reader's perception of the conditions on other planets, making them seem less appealing or harsher than in the original text.","The French 'Ainsi on pourrait même se passer dans Mercure du Salpêtre & des pluies' means 'Thus one could even do without Saltpeter and rains in Mercury'. The English translation 'So in Mercury they may live well enough without Saltpeter or Rain' inserts the qualifying phrase 'live well enough'. This addition is not present in the original, which focuses on the capacity to 'do without'. By adding 'live well enough', the translation frames this capacity within a context of merely adequate survival, reinforcing the earlier shift from 'agréablement' (pleasantly) and subtly manipulating the reader's understanding of adaptability on Mercury."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P061: Aprés Mercure vous savez qu'on trouve le Soleil.

The English translation \"the cause is clear\" changes this to a direct assertion that the reason for the Sun's non-habitability is self-evident. This alters the original text's more nuanced point about the failure of a specific line of reasoning in this instance.","The original French distinguishes between the Sun distributing \"la\" (\"it\" – implicitly light or the sun's general emanation, previously described as \"précieuse substance\") equally, and separately animating everything \"par sa chaleur\" (by its heat). The English translation changes this to \"equally distribute his Heat and animate all things with it [Heat],\" thereby conflating these two distinct solar functions and making heat the sole element being distributed and the primary agent of animation. This narrows the original's broader description of solar influence.","The French text includes the clause \"& qu'enfin les nouvelles Planetes s'étoient mises à la mode\" (and that finally the new planets had come into fashion) as one of the reasons for the philosophers' hasty judgment about sunspots. This clause, which adds a layer of social commentary on the trendiness of scientific discoveries influencing judgment, is omitted in the English translation. This omission removes Fontenelle's subtle critique of how scientific attention can be swayed by fashion, simplifying the depicted motivation to mere intellectual preoccupation.","The French \"le maître des taches\" (the master of the spots), signifying secular control or authority over the naming of the sunspots, is translated as \"Godfather to the chief of those Spots.\" This introduces the term \"Godfather,\" which carries specific English cultural and potentially religious connotations not present in the original's more neutral \"maître\" (master). Additionally, it shifts the focus from a general contest over \"the spots\" to sponsorship of \"the chief of those Spots,\" altering both the tone and the specifics of the dispute described by Fontenelle."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

While \"virtuoso\" could refer to a scholar in the 17th century, it often carried implications of a collector or dilettante rather than a dedicated, systematic scientist, particularly in some English satirical contexts of the period. This change might slightly diminish the perceived seriousness or professional standing of the figures Fontenelle refers to, in a work aimed at popularizing rigorous science.","The original French \"mais ils n'en devroient point permettre l'entrée à d'autres\" means \"but they should not allow entry to others.\" The translation's phrasing \"and govern there without admitting any Rivals\" introduces the specific notion of \"Rivals,\" implying competition and potential antagonism not explicitly present in the more general term \"autres\" (others). This shifts the perception of the scientists' exclusivity from a general guarding of their domain to an active defense against competitors, adding a layer of contest.","The French \"quelque chose qui arrive dans les Lunettes\" (literally \"something that happens in the telescopes/lenses,\" referring to optical artifacts) is rendered as \"some accident in the Telescope.\" The term \"accident\" implies a chance, unforeseen, or random mishap, which is a more specific interpretation than the neutral \"quelque chose qui arrive.\" This subtly frames the observational issue as potentially due to a flaw or random event rather than an inherent characteristic or limitation of early telescopic optics, which could slightly alter the reader's perception of the reliability of these new scientific instruments.","The French \"Vous n'y songez pas,\" a gentle expression meaning \"You are not thinking of that\" or \"You haven't considered that [specific point],\" is translated as \"You never consider.\" The addition of \"never\" intensifies the statement, changing it from a comment on a momentary oversight regarding a particular detail to a more general remark, possibly implying a habitual lack of consideration.

The English translation 'he is less than the Earth,' omits the specific quantifier 'cinq fois' (five times), reducing the scientific precision and making the description of Mars's relative size vaguer, thus altering the reader's perception of the information's detail.","The French 'un peu moins grand & moins vif' (a little less big and less bright) conveys a nuanced, slight degree of difference. The English translation 'neither so big nor so bright as we' removes the qualifier 'un peu' (a little) and uses a more categorical 'neither...nor' construction. This subtly exaggerates the difference, altering the precise meaning by making the Sun's appearance from Mars seem significantly diminished rather than slightly so.","The French 'Mais la jolie chose que Jupiter avec ses quatre Lunes ou Satellites!' is an exclamation of wonder, meaning 'But what a pretty/fine thing Jupiter is with its four Moons or Satellites!'. The English translation 'But the jolly Iupiter with his four Moons or Satellits is worth a Visit.' adds the phrase 'is worth a Visit,' which changes the nature of the utterance from an expression of awe at a natural phenomenon to a practical recommendation or valuation of Jupiter as a destination. This subtly shifts the tone and the focus of the philosopher's remark."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P064: Ah!

The translation 'pray make an end of fooling me' changes this to a suspicion of being deceived, altering her portrayal from an active, curious learner to a passive figure who feels tricked, and shifting the tone of her engagement.","The French 'je ne connois plus de retenuë sur la Philosophie' (I no longer know any restraint regarding Philosophy) signifies the Marquise's unreserved immersion in the subject. The translation 'nor muse longer upon Philosophy' incorrectly implies she will cease philosophical reflection, misrepresenting her enthusiastic, unrestrained engagement as disengagement.","The phrase 'laissons parler le monde' (let the world/people talk) within the larger utterance signifies defiance against societal judgment of her intellectual pursuits. The translation 'let us leave talking of the World' (as a topic) replaces this social rebellion with a mere change of conversational subject, omitting the Marquise's boldness and the social commentary.","The philosopher's original remark, 'c'est dommage qu'ils [ses emportements] n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet,' (it's a pity her passions/transports are only for Vortices as their object) carries a flirtatious undertone, implying he wishes her passion might be directed elsewhere. The translation ''tis pity there is any other Objects than Vortices' reverses this, suggesting it is regrettable that anything *besides* Vortices commands passion. This eliminates the original's gallantry and alters the interpersonal dynamic.","The French 'se meuvent toutes en un même sens' clearly states that the parts 'all move in the same direction,' a crucial detail for Descartes' vortex theory. The translation 'move all in conformity to themselves' is vague and obscure, failing to convey this specific directional aspect and potentially misleading the reader about the scientific mechanics being explained.","The original 'en un même sens' specifies that the planets turn 'in the same direction' around the Sun. The translation 'uniformly' introduces a concept of regularity or constant manner of motion, which, while possibly implied by the broader theory, is not a direct translation of 'in the same direction.' This subtly shifts the emphasis from the specific detail of shared directionality to a more general quality of uniformity, potentially altering the reader's understanding of the precise astronomical mechanics described."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P065: Voilà quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme le Maître; mais en même temps les Planetes se composent de petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de celuy du Soleil.

The English translation \"do incroach\" (encroach) implies an active, gradual, and potentially unauthorized intrusion or transgression by the smaller planet. This subtly alters the original meaning by changing the perceived agency and nature of the planet's movement from a neutral occurrence to an active imposition.","The French \"à notre bienséance\" translates to \"at our convenience,\" \"suitability,\" or \"what is fitting,\" indicating a practical or opportune arrangement. The English translation \"wholly at our devotion\" introduces a strong connotation of subservience, loyalty, or worshipful dedication from the Moon to the Earth. This significantly alters the tone and meaning, personifying the astronomical relationship with an emotional and hierarchical charge not present in the original.","The French \"il se les assujettit\" means \"he made them subject to him\" or \"he subordinated them,\" describing a state of being under Jupiter's influence due to its greater force. The English translation \"he subdu'd them all\" implies a more forceful action of conquering or overpowering, potentially after overcoming resistance. This changes the tone, portraying Jupiter's gravitational dominance as a more active and combative conquest, rather than a natural consequence of its properties within the vortex theory.","The French \"une Lune de sa dépendance\" means \"a moon dependent on him\" or \"a moon in a state of subordination to him,\" emphasizing a condition of reliance. The English translation \"a Moon attending on him\" suggests active service or waiting upon, like a courtier serving a monarch. This personifies the potential relationship of Earth to Jupiter, shifting the meaning from a state of dependency to one of active servitude, thereby altering the reader's perception of the astronomical hierarchy.","The French \"qu'on\" is an indefinite pronoun meaning \"one\" or \"people\" in general, making the concluding philosophical reflection universal. The English translation \"of a man\" restricts this universal observation specifically to males. Given that Fontenelle's work was notably aimed at a female audience (the Marquise) and sought to make science accessible to women, this alteration manipulates the reader's perception by excluding women from this general truth, thereby undermining the inclusive intent of the original text and reinforcing contemporary patriarchal norms."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes?

This subtly alters the reader's perception of the light conditions on Jupiter, potentially overstating the weakness of the light compared to the more nuanced original.","The French \"sont faites\" (are made/exist) is translated as \"were design'd.\" This introduces a strong teleological implication of an intentional creator or divine plan, which is less explicit in Fontenelle's more neutral phrasing. In the historical context of burgeoning scientific thought and religious sensitivities in late 17th-century England, this shift could manipulate the reader by aligning Fontenelle's work more closely with prevailing deistic or creationist views, subtly altering its philosophical undertone.","The source text states Jupiter's fourth moon completes its orbit in \"quarante-deux heures\" (forty-two hours). The translation incorrectly changes this to \"forty hours.\" This factual error misinforms the reader about the astronomical data presented, thereby manipulating their understanding of the specifics of Jupiter's moon system as described by Fontenelle.","The phrase \"ce jeu perpétuel d'Eclipses\" (this perpetual game/play of Eclipses) is reduced to \"their Eclipses.\" This omission removes Fontenelle's vivid and playful metaphor that characterizes the eclipses as a dynamic, entertaining spectacle. This manipulation alters the tone of the description, making it more sterile and less evocative, and diminishes the literary charm that was a key feature of Fontenelle's popular science writing.","The French phrase \"au mois\" literally means \"in the month\" or \"to the month,\" which, in the context of a short timeframe (\"vingt & heures\", translated as 21 hours), is nonsensical. The translation \"at least\" makes the sentence coherent, likely by correcting a typographical error in the source text (assuming an original \"au moins\"). However, by deviating from the literal meaning of the provided French segment \"au mois,\" the translation significantly alters the meaning conveyed by that specific part of the given source text. It replaces a confusing (and likely erroneous) temporal reference with a logical quantifier of quantity, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of what the provided source text segment actually states."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P070: Et vous ne manquerez pas, dit la Marquise, à faire habiter ces quatre Lunes, quoy que ce ne foient que de petites Planetes subalternes, destinées seulement à en éclairer une autre pendant ces nuits?

The translation 'for being subjected' omits 'le malheur' (the misfortune) and uses a more neutral term than 'asservies,' subtly altering the tone by reducing the expressed empathy.","The translator significantly expands the Marquise's statement. The original French expresses her imagining the inhabitants of Jupiter's moons constantly under the visual imposition of the 'monstrous Planet.' The English translation replaces this with entirely new concepts of them being 'Colonies,' receiving 'Laws and Customs,' rendering 'Homage,' and showing 'Respect,' introducing a hierarchical, colonial, and political dimension absent in the original.","The translator inserts a lengthy speech attributed to the philosopher, which has no counterpart in the original French text at this point. This addition introduces new political concepts like 'Deputies' and 'Oath of Fidelity,' emphasizing governance and hierarchy, and has the philosopher discuss Jupiter's frightening aspect and size, altering conversational flow and idea attribution.","The translator adds the phrase 'They have then that monstrous Planet daily hanging over their heads at a very little distance' at the beginning of the Marquise's statement about the Gauls.

The translation 'that Man could not deliver himself from the fear of Eclipses, without paying for it by some folly' manipulates this in two ways: 1) It specifies 'de la' (from that) as 'from the fear of Eclipses,' adding concrete information that might narrow an intentionally general reference. 2) More significantly, 'impunément' (with impunity/without consequence) is rendered as 'without paying for it by some folly.' This introduces the notion of a direct 'payment' and uses the stronger, more judgmental term 'folly,' whereas Fontenelle later uses the more neutral 'erreur' (error) for similar concepts. This shift alters the philosophical nuance from an inescapable consequence of error to a transactional cost, subtly heightening the negative judgment on human fallibility.","The original French 'mais comme je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner' translates to 'but as I do not pride myself on being able to guess it' or 'I don't claim to be able to guess it,' expressing the Marquise's intellectual humility regarding predicting the errors of Jupiter's moon's inhabitants. The English translation 'but-how, I trouble not my head to guess' changes her tone significantly. It suggests a dismissive attitude or a deliberate refusal to engage mentally ('I trouble not my head'), rather than a modest acknowledgment of her limitations. This alters the reader's perception of the Marquise's character, making her seem less thoughtfully engaged.","The French phrase 'une autre difficulté qui m'occupe depuis quelques moments' means 'another difficulty that has been occupying my mind for a few moments,' indicating a question or problem the Marquise has been calmly considering. The translation 'another difficulty has possess'd me within this little while' uses the verb 'possess'd,' which is far more intense. This implies an overwhelming, almost involuntary obsession with the difficulty, rather than thoughtful contemplation. This alters the tone, making the Marquise seem more emotionally overwrought or less rationally composed than in the original, subtly changing her characterization."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P073: De bonne foy, je croy que cela est, répondis-je.

This alteration makes Nature's providence appear universally meticulous and all-encompassing, rather than selective. This subtly manipulates the reader's perception of the extent of Nature's design as argued by Fontenelle, potentially making the argument for a perfectly ordered universe seem stronger or more absolute than in the original.","The translation omits the phrase \"qui rentroit en elle-même\" (who was recollecting herself / becoming introspective), reducing the Marquise's reaction solely to astonishment. This simplification subtly alters the portrayal of the Marquise by removing an indication of her thoughtful internal reflection. It potentially diminishes the perception of her intellectual engagement with the complex ideas being discussed, which is significant given Fontenelle's aim to present women as capable participants in scientific discourse.","The French \"Vous ne sauriez rier que ce ne fût un Spectacle assez agreable\" (literally closer to \"You could not laugh [scoff] at it not being a quite agreeable spectacle,\" or \"You couldn't help but find it quite agreeable...\") is translated as \"You cannot deny that it would be a delightful spectacle.\" This translation changes the original's playful, subtly challenging tone, implied by \"rier\" (to laugh, jest, or scoff), into a more formal and assertive \"You cannot deny.\" Additionally, \"assez agreable\" (quite pleasant/agreeable) is intensified to \"delightful.\" This combined shift alters Fontenelle's characteristic light and witty style, presenting the philosopher's speculation with a stronger, less nuanced conviction.","The French \"répandre un nouveau jour\" (to spread a new day/light) is translated as \"create a new day.\" The verb \"répandre\" means to spread or diffuse, suggesting the dissemination or extension of light. \"Create\" is a more potent verb, implying origination or bringing something into existence. This change subtly manipulates the reader's perception by exaggerating the imagined capability of the luminous birds on Mars, shifting the description from a fantastical spreading of light to a more powerful, almost generative act.

The English translation changes this crucial part to \"there is occasion for them,\" softening necessity to mere utility or reason. This alters the meaning by diminishing the sense of natural law implied in the Marquise's observation, thereby subtly changing the reader's perception of the strength of her reasoning.","The French \"on ne peut pas se dispenser de les peupler\" is an impersonal and assertive statement, implying a generally accepted step in the thought experiment (\"one cannot avoid peopling them\"). The English translation introduces \"I think,\" personalizing the assertion to the philosopher-narrator and adding a degree of subjectivity. This change in tone weakens the statement's force, subtly manipulating the reader's perception by making the peopling of moons seem more like a personal conjecture of the narrator rather than a logical consequence within the dialogue's framework.","The original French hypothesis includes the specific detail \"trois échappées\" (three escaped ones) within the clause \"que les cinq petites Lunes fussent trois échappées de ce grand Cercle\". The English translation in the corresponding clause \"that the five little Moons are such as have made their escape from the great Circle\" omits the specific number \"trois\" (three). This omission of information makes the scientific speculation less precise, altering the reader's understanding by removing a concrete detail of a contemporary astronomical idea.","The French phrase \"une chaleur bien foible\" translates to \"a very feeble heat,\" with \"bien\" acting as an intensifier. The English translation \"a feeble heat\" omits this intensifier.

The translation \"for making him a Man\" introduces \"Nature\" (personified) as an active creator. This shift subtly imbues Nature with more direct agency, potentially aligning with a more traditional, providential view of Nature's role, which could be significant in the context of emerging Enlightenment ideas about a universe governed by natural laws rather than continuous divine intervention.","Similar to the previous instance, the original French \"d'être sur la Planete\" (for being on the Planet) describes a state of being. The translation \"for placing me in the most temperate Planet\" changes this to an act of \"placing\" by Nature. This again attributes active agency to Nature, subtly shifting the reader's perception from a simple state of existence to an act of deliberate placement, potentially reinforcing a view of a designed or divinely arranged world.","The French \"vous luy rendrez grâce\" (you will give her thanks, or you shall give her thanks) uses the future indicative, carrying a tone of confident assertion or prescription by the philosopher. The English translation \"you may give her thanks\" shifts this to a permissive or potential mood. This alteration softens the philosopher's didactic tone, making his statement sound more like a suggestion than a firm declaration of what constitutes true reasons for gratitude.","The French \"sujets de reconnoissance\" (subjects/reasons for gratitude) is translated as \"things to be acknowledg'd as advantages.\" This changes the emphasis from an emotional or moral act of thankfulness (\"reconnoissance\") to a more pragmatic recognition of beneficial circumstances (\"advantages\"). Furthermore, the comparative conjunction \"que\" (than), which implies \"other... than those,\" is replaced by \"as well as.\" This alters the structure from a comparison (potentially highlighting the personal reasons as more significant) to a simple addition, thereby flattening the nuance and potential hierarchy of importance in the philosopher's argument."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P084: Mon Dieu! répliqua-t-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">laissez-moy avoir de la reconnaissance sur tout</span></span>, jusque sur le Tourbillon où je suis placée.

The translation \"stay long\" is ambiguous; it could imply having to remain in a certain state or place for a long duration to obtain these pleasures, but it omits the direct meaning of \"waiting for\" them. This subtly alters the original sense of the effort or patience required to obtain these pleasures.","The original French \"si on vous proposoit\" uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" (one/someone), indicating that any source might offer \"lively pleasures.\" The translation shifts \"on\" to \"I,\" making the philosopher the specific hypothetical proposer. This personalizes the scenario, changing the test from the Marquise's general steadfastness against any temptation to her loyalty concerning the philosopher's own potential offerings, thereby subtly altering the dynamic of their dialogue.","The French \"que vous vous borneriez à nous\" means \"that you would limit/confine yourself to us\" or \"be content with us,\" implying a personal commitment to find sufficiency with the philosopher and his intellectual offerings. The translation \"and will be of our side.\" fundamentally alters this to an act of taking partisan allegiance. This reframes the Marquise's commitment in terms of choosing a faction rather than personal philosophical contentment, significantly changing the original meaning and potentially reflecting the divisive socio-political climate of contemporary England."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">CINQUIEME SOIR.

This omission removes a key scientific and philosophical assertion that explicitly frames the chapter's content in the original.

The English addition of \"why\" subtly shifts the tone of the Marquise's exclamation. It can be interpreted as an interjection of surprise (\"Why, look at that!\") or a slightly querulous question (\"Why is it so big?\"), adding a layer to her expression of awe that is not as prominent in the original statement.","The French text includes the clause 'Autant d'espaces pareils que d'Etoiles Fixes?' ('As many such spaces as there are Fixed Stars?') immediately following 'l'Univers?'. This concluding part of the Marquise's series of rhetorical questions, which further emphasizes the vastness of the cosmos, is omitted in the English translation after 'the Universe?'. This omission curtails the full expression of her dawning comprehension and reduces the impact of this realization.","The French 'me trouble' (disturbs/worries me) and 'm'épouvante' (terrifies/horrifies me) convey strong emotional distress and fear in the Marquise. The English translation 'perplexes and astonishes me' significantly tones down this emotional intensity. 'Perplexes' shifts the meaning from emotional disturbance to intellectual confusion, and 'astonishes' replaces terror with mere surprise or amazement, thereby altering the portrayal of the Marquise's reaction to the new cosmology.","The French 'le ciel' translates directly to 'the sky.' The English translation uses 'Heaven.' While 'Heaven' can mean sky, it predominantly carries strong religious connotations (the abode of God), especially in 17th-century England. Given Fontenelle's secular popularization of science and the era's religious tensions, this choice over the more neutral 'sky' subtly infuses a religious coloring or framing that 'le ciel' alone does not, potentially manipulating the reader's perception of the philosopher's scientifically-oriented statement.","The French 'qu'on a donné' (that one/we/people have given) implies that human understanding or scientific discovery has actively re-conceptualized the 'voûte' (vault of the sky). The English translation 'that this Vault is of...' presents the new, vast dimensions as an inherent quality of the Vault itself. This removes the element of human agency in this re-perception, subtly downplaying the role of human intellectual endeavor and the process of scientific enlightenment in 'expanding' the universe conceptually.","The French 'mille & mille' (thousands upon thousands) is an idiomatic and somewhat poetic expression for a vast, indefinite large number. The English 'a thousand thousand' translates to the specific quantity of 'one million.' This change replaces a general sense of immense multiplicity with a concrete, arithmetically larger number, altering the perceived scale and making the description more numerically definite than evocatively vast.","The French 'dont le milieu est occupé par un Soleil' (whose middle is occupied by a Sun) is a neutral description of the Sun's position within a vortex. The English translation 'in the Center whereof is seated the Sun' uses the verb 'seated.' This verb can connote enthronement or a position of authority and majesty, subtly elevating the Sun's status to that of a ruler in its domain, a more regal depiction than the original's simpler, more objective 'occupied.'"]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P089: Vous m'offrez, dit-elle, une espece de Perspective si longue, que la veuë n'en peut attraper le bout.

Furthermore, \"dans l'enfoncement\" (literally 'in the recess/sinking,' meaning in the distant background, indistinct) is rendered as \"wholly drown'd.\" This powerful metaphor of drowning is an intensification not present in the original, which uses a more visual and less dramatic term for distance and obscurity, thus altering the perceived state of these distant inhabitants and manipulating the reader's understanding of their condition.","The original \"ne croy pas avoir desormais d'empressement pour aucune chose\" (I don't think I'll henceforth have eagerness/keenness for anything) describes a loss of personal motivation or enthusiasm. The translation \"I shall have no value for any thing in it\" shifts this to a declaration about the objective (or perceived objective) worthlessness of things, rather than a subjective change in the speaker's feelings or drive. This alters the philosophical nuance of the Marquise's reaction, manipulating the reader's understanding of her internal change.","The French uses the indefinite pronoun \"on\" (one/people/we) in \"si on a tant d'ardeur de s'agrandir\" (if one has such an ardor to aggrandize oneself), making a general observation about human nature. The translation renders the subject of this ambition as \"men\" (\"men are so earnest in the pursuit of Greatness\"), narrowing the scope of this universal trait. Given Fontenelle's explicit aim to include women in scientific and philosophical discourse, this change subtly reasserts a male-centric perspective that the original text avoids, thereby shifting the reader's perception of whom the critique applies to.","The French \"c'eût eté faire trop mal sa Cour que de luy en parler\" (it would have been currying favor very badly/a serious misstep at Court to speak to him of it) implies a significant political miscalculation with potentially severe consequences in navigating courtly power dynamics. The translation \"it had been an ill Complement to have told him of them\" drastically softens this, reducing a dangerous error in judgment to merely giving an inappropriate or poorly received remark. This alters the tone and downplays the original's astute observation on the precarity of court politics, manipulating the reader's sense of the stakes involved.","The French \"Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau\" (A little weakness for what is beautiful) is translated as \"a little foolish inclination for the thing that's fair.\" The addition of \"foolish\" is an interpretive judgment not present in the original \"foiblesse\" (weakness, slight flaw, penchant). It changes the connotation of the Marquise's self-description, making her admitted \"malady\" (her susceptibility to beauty) sound more trivial and less like a gentle, humanizing trait, thereby subtly manipulating the reader's perception of her character."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle, en riant; il se sauve de tout, &amp; il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal.

(truly/really absolute?) contains the intensifier 'bien,' which emphasizes the Marquise's specific doubt about the *degree* of the argument's necessity. The translation 'of absolute necessity?' omits this intensifier, thereby reducing the force of her skepticism. The original expresses a doubt about whether the necessity is *truly* absolute, while the translation asks about 'absolute necessity' in a more general way, subtly altering the critical edge of her question.","The French '& à la fin cela va loin.' (and in the end, that goes far/leads to significant consequences) is a general observation about the far-reaching implications of yielding a point. The translation 'and so to the Worlds end.' replaces this with a dramatic, hyperbolic idiom. This intensification makes the power of logical deduction (and, by analogy, of yielding in love) seem more extreme and absolute than in the original, potentially manipulating the reader's perception of the inexorability of such progressions.","The French 'il faut franchir le pas de bonne grâce.' translates to 'one must take the step/plunge willingly' or 'with good grace.' The English 'you must e'en go on.' conveys the necessity ('must') and inevitability ('e'en') of proceeding but omits the crucial aspect of doing so 'de bonne grâce' (willingly, gracefully). This omission changes the philosopher's tone from encouraging a willing or gracious acceptance to a more blunt directive, subtly altering the perceived dynamic between the characters and the nature of intellectual assent."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P091: Cela est hors de doute, répondis-je.

The translation 'no body dreams of them' introduces a more figurative and intensified tone. 'Songer à' here implies 'to think of,' not primarily 'to dream of.' This shift subtly manipulates the reader by exaggerating the indifference towards these planets, changing it from a practical lack of consideration due to invisibility to a more profound, almost imaginative, disregard.","The French 'ne laisse de porter' (does not fail to bear/nevertheless bears) in the clause 'car un fond de ressemblance ne laisse de porter des differences infinies?' expresses a strong assertion that fundamental similarity inherently leads to infinite differences.

The English translation \"where we usually reckon\" (present tense, using 'we' which can include the speaker, listener, and reader) shifts this action to a current, habitual practice or estimation. This alteration subtly manipulates the reader's understanding by framing the smaller, pre-telescopic count of stars not as a definitively superseded historical understanding that highlights the revolutionary impact of the telescope, but as a common, possibly ongoing, baseline reckoning.

The translation \"Grainery of Worlds\" changes this to an image of a storehouse for already existing worlds. This alters the original's dynamic and generative metaphor to a more static one, subtly shifting the perception of the cosmos from a place of ongoing creation to a filled repository.","The French \"apparemment\" (apparently, seemingly) suggests a degree of observation-based inference or cautious assertion. The translation \"evidently\" implies a much stronger level of certainty and obviousness. This shift makes the philosopher's statement about the \"little Worlds\" departing from a general rule more dogmatic and less speculative than in the original, potentially altering the reader's perception of the scientific claims' certainty in a work popularizing new and debated ideas.","The original French \"un Soleil\" (a Sun / one Sun) is part of a declarative statement describing a general rule in Cartesian vortex theory: \"par laquelle un Soleil dans son Tourbillon efface dés qu'il paroît tous les Soleils étrangers.\" The English translation \"one Sun?\" in the phrase \"by which one Sun? when he appears in his Vortex, extinguishes all forreign Suns\" introduces a question mark directly after \"Sun\". If this punctuation is authentic to the historical translation, it injects an interrogative or exclamatory tone not present in the source. This could make the reader pause to question or marvel at the concept of \"one Sun\" having this effect, thereby subtly altering the straightforward, explanatory nature of Fontenelle's text and potentially the perceived nature of the scientific rule being described.","The French \"Etres disgraciez de la Nature\" means beings disfavored or disadvantaged by Nature, implying a lack of privilege or fortune within the natural order. The translation \"Beings curs'd by Nature\" is a significant intensification, suggesting a malediction or a deliberate infliction of suffering. This changes the tone from one of naturalistic variation to one of harsh judgment or doom, potentially imbuing Earth's condition (having night and only one sun) with more severe, almost moral or fatalistic connotations absent in Fontenelle's original, which was moving towards a more rational and less judgmental view of the universe."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P096: Je ne vous demande pas, dit la Marquise, s'il y a des Lunes dans les Mondes de la Voie de Lait; je voy bien qu'elles n'y seroient de nul usage aux Planetes principales qui n'ont point de nuit, &amp; qui d'ailleurs marchent dans des espaces trop étroits pour s'embarrasser de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">cet attirail de Planetes subalternes</span></span>.

While an archaic sense of \"attirail\" could refer to a \"retinue\" or \"train\" of a great personage, translating it as \"attendance\" (in the sense of a retinue) shifts the primary imagery. Instead of subordinate planets being like cumbersome physical baggage or equipment for the principal planets, they are portrayed as a \"following\" or \"entourage.\" This subtly changes the nature of the encumbrance described by \"s'embarrasser de\" (to be encumbered with) from dealing with inanimate, burdensome objects to managing a group of followers. This alteration in imagery and connotation manipulates the reader's perception, lending a more courtly or personified tone to the astronomical discussion rather than a purely physical or mechanical one, which might subtly shift the understanding of the scientific analogy.","The French word \"Boules,\" in the context of \"Tourbillons\" (Vortices) which the Marquise understands to be \"ronds\" (round, implying spherical in a three-dimensional astronomical context), clearly means \"spheres\" or \"balls.\" The translation \"Bowls\" (referring to concave vessels) is a significant mistranslation of the geometric shape. This error fundamentally alters the imagery of the Marquise's conceptual difficulty. Her question \"comment tant de Boules en peuvent-elles toucher une seule?\" concerns a problem of sphere packing (how many spheres can touch a central sphere). By translating \"Boules\" as \"Bowls,\" the reader is presented with a confusing and different problem about arranging concave \"bowls,\" which manipulates their understanding of the scientific or geometric puzzle Fontenelle is presenting. It makes the Marquise's intellectual challenge seem based on an absurd premise rather than a genuine, albeit complex, geometric visualization."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P097: Il y a beaucoup d'esprit, répondis-je, à avoir cette difficulté-là, &amp; même à ne la pouvoir résoudre; car elle est tres-bonne en soy, &amp; de la maniere dont vous la concevez, elle est sans réponse, &amp; c'est avoir bien peu d'esprit que de trouver des réponses à ce qui n'en a point.

Its absence means that the subsequent English phrase \"Nature, in that case,\" describes Nature's intervention without Fontenelle's explicit emphasis on the high frequency and inevitability of such voids, subtly altering the reader's perception of this cosmic process.","The French \"on prétend que\" translates to \"it is claimed/asserted that\" or \"they (some) claim that,\" indicating a specific assertion or theory being reported, likely from Cartesian philosophy. The English translation \"'tis thought that\" softens this to a more general or vague \"it is believed/supposed that.\" This shift lessens the forcefulness of the reported claim about the cause of stars twinkling, making it sound more like a common speculation rather than a distinct tenet of a particular philosophical system, which could subtly distance the text from Cartesian certainty in a period marked by the rise of Newtonian physics.","The French construction \"ne paroissent briller à reprises, que parce que...\" means they \"only appear to shine intermittently because...\" or \"appear to shine intermittently only because...\", indicating that the *sole reason* for the stars' twinkling is the interaction of vortices. The English translation \"seem to twinkle only, because...\" strongly suggests, by its syntax, that \"only\" modifies \"twinkle\" (i.e., the only thing stars do is twinkle, or they only *seem* to twinkle). This alters the logical emphasis of Fontenelle's statement from the exclusivity of the *cause* of twinkling to an exclusivity of the *act* or *appearance* of twinkling, thereby manipulating the reader's understanding of the scientific explanation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">J'aime fort</span></span> toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

The English translation 'I have a great kindness' is a significantly milder and more formal expression, suggesting a detached benevolence or polite approval rather than genuine passion. This alteration tones down the Marquise's intellectual vivacity and her active engagement with the scientific ideas, potentially manipulating the reader's perception of her character to be more reserved and less intellectually fervent than Fontenelle's original, which was progressive in portraying an intellectually curious woman.","The French 'sur tout j'aime à voir' (above all I love to see/I greatly enjoy seeing) again indicates the Marquise's strong, active enjoyment and intellectual curiosity. The translation 'above all, I am pleas'd to see' renders this enthusiasm as a more passive and subdued form of appreciation ('pleas'd').

The English translation \"with a bright shining Perriwig\" replaces \"chevelure\" (head of hair) with \"Perriwig\" (a wig). This substitution constitutes indirect manipulation because: 1. It introduces artificiality: \"Chevelure\" in this context implies natural hair, whereas a \"Perriwig\" is an explicitly man-made, artificial item. This shifts the perception of the comet's adornment from natural to artificial. 2. It adds cultural specificity and potentially alters tone: A \"Perriwig\" was a distinct fashion item of the late 17th and 18th centuries. Introducing this specific human accessory makes the celestial description more grounded in contemporary (to the translator) human fashion, potentially adding a layer of whimsy, comicality, or even triviality not necessarily present in Fontenelle's more general and elegant \"chevelure éclatante.\" This alters the connotation and might not fully align with Fontenelle's blend of scientific popularization and literary charm, which tended towards more timeless metaphors."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P100: Ah! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">quels Deputez</span></span> dit-elle en riant!

What deputies!\"). The translation changes this to a question, \"what kind of Embassadours are those?\". This shift to an interrogative form, combined with upgrading \"Deputez\" (deputies/envoys) to the more formal and potentially politically resonant \"Embassadours\" (ambassadors), subtly alters the Marquise's tone. Instead of simple amusement at the metaphor, it introduces a more skeptical or questioning stance towards these celestial \"visitors.\" In the context of 1680s England, with heightened suspicion of foreign influences, portraying comets as questionable \"ambassadors\" from other \"worlds\" could subtly manipulate the reader's perception towards wariness, contrasting with Fontenelle's aim of scientific popularization and demystification.","The French verb phrase \"entrent dans\" translates to \"enter into\" or \"go into,\" which is a neutral description of movement dictated by Cartesian physics. The English translation \"incroach upon\" introduces a strong negative connotation, implying that the comets are trespassing or wrongfully intruding into \"our\" vortex. This choice of word alters the original's purely mechanistic explanation, framing the \"foreign planets\" not just as outsiders, but as transgressive entities. This subtly manipulates the reader's understanding by injecting a sense of violation or threat, potentially resonating with contemporary English anxieties about foreign encroachment and undermining Fontenelle's aim to present a rational, non-frightening view of comets."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P101: J'entends, dit-elle..

This suggests the planets are part of the domain or company in which this reception occurs. The English translation `and with our own Planets; but we receive them` alters this structure. The phrase 'and with our own Planets;' followed by a semicolon and the contrasting conjunction 'but' tends to disassociate 'with our own Planets' from the act of receiving. Instead, it aligns 'with our own Planets' more closely with the preceding prohibition ('we suffer them not to enter...'), implying that the planets might also be part of what the visitors are kept from. This subtly shifts the described cosmic geography, potentially moving the planets from being part of the reception area to being part of a restricted zone, thereby altering the reader's understanding of the analogy.","The French phrase `Ambassadeurs qu'on luy envoye` translates to 'Ambassadors whom one sends to him' or 'Ambassadors that are sent to him,' explicitly emphasizing that these are envoys arriving from an external source and clarifying their status. The English translation truncates this to simply `Embassadours`, omitting the relative clause `qu'on luy envoye`. This omission removes the direct textual confirmation of the ambassadors' origin as being *sent to* the Grand Seigneur. While the term 'ambassadors' inherently implies being sent, the loss of this explicit reinforcement makes the description slightly less precise and subtly weakens the analogy to comets, which are characterized by their arrival from outside the solar system."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P102: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">A en juger par toutes ces choses là, répliqua-t-elle,.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">nous sommes bien fiers</span></span>.

This subtly alters the scientific description by attributing an intensity to the phenomenon that Fontenelle did not specify, potentially making the philosopher's explanation seem more forceful or definitive.","The French 'on la devinera' (one will guess it / one will figure it out) implies a future discovery process that may involve speculation or hypothesis. The translation 'we'l judge more certainly of it' shifts the tone to a more definitive, reasoned, and assured future assessment. This alters the perception of the scientific endeavor, portraying it as leading to more certain judgment rather than the more open-ended inquiry implied by Fontenelle.","The translation omits 'se repoussent' (repel each other) from the original French description of the vortices' interaction. This simplification alters the reader's understanding of the forces at play by removing the aspect of mutual repulsion, presenting a less complex and potentially less violent image of the cosmic event.","The translation omits the colloquial phrase 'nous autres' (we humans/us folk), which in French adds a nuance of shared, perhaps common, human belief. Additionally, the intensifier 'bien' (very) is dropped from 'bien malheureux' (very unhappy). These omissions lessen the colloquial tone and the expressed degree of unhappiness, subtly altering the original emphasis.","The translation introduces the conjunction 'whereas' and alters the clause structure, lending a more formal, argumentative tone than the original French relative clause 'elle-même qui est bien malheureuse' (itself which is very unhappy). The intensifier 'bien' (very) is also omitted, reducing the stated unhappiness of the comet. This combination subtly shifts the rhetorical balance and emphasis of the statement.","The French 'ennuyeuse' (boring, tedious) is translated as 'uneasie enough' (sufficiently uncomfortable or anxious). This represents a significant semantic shift, fundamentally changing the Marquise's expressed feeling about her current life from one of boredom to one of discomfort or anxiety, thereby misrepresenting her sentiment and altering the reader's understanding of her perspective.","The adverb 'aussi-tôt' (immediately, at once), present in the French phrase 'crient aussi-tôt._Nouveau Soleil, Nouveau Soleil' (cry out immediately 'New Sun, New Sun'), is omitted in the English translation 'cry A new Sun, a new Sun'. This omission removes the explicit sense of immediacy in the comet dwellers' reaction, thereby reducing the vividness and urgency of the scene described."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P104: Il ne faut donc plus songer, luy dis-je, à vous donner de la pitié pour les Habitans d'une Comète, mais j'espère du moins que vous plaindrez ceux qui vivent dans <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">un Tourbillon dont le Soleil vient à s'éteindre, &amp; qui demeurent dans une nuit éternelle.</span></span> Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent?

Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer</span></span> que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé.

Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, il faut que l'espce se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage.

How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say.

Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it.

The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever?

This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World?

Place Worlds there, or place them not, 'twill depend upon your self.

Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">said he</span></span>, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">the mischief,</span></span> there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">a Source and Spring of Light?</span></span> The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense</span></span>, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun.

This omission lessens the dramatic impact and the grimness of the scenario presented in the original, subtly altering the reader's perception of the consequences.","Translating \"reprit-elle\" (she replied/said) as \"said he\" erroneously attributes the Marquise's speech to a male speaker. This error disrupts the dialogue, potentially confuses the reader about the speaker's identity, and misrepresents the interactive nature of the conversation which is central to Fontenelle's method of popularizing science, particularly for a female audience.","The French \"êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer\" (were amusing/comical to imagine) carries a slightly mocking or dismissive tone towards the Ancients' naivety, reflecting an early Enlightenment critique of past authorities. The English \"had a pleasant fancy\" softens this critique, making the Ancients' idea sound more quaint or whimsical rather than comically misguided. This alters the critical tone of the original text.","\"Un étrange malheur\" (a strange misfortune/calamity) suggests a significant and unfortunate event. \"The mischief,\" often implies trouble that is less severe, sometimes even playful. This translation lessens the gravity of the \"strange misfortune\" Fontenelle describes regarding stellar phenomena, altering the tone and the perceived seriousness of the astronomical problem.","The original \"une source de lumière\" (a source of light) is translated as \"a Source and Spring of Light\". The addition of \"and Spring\" is an embellishment not present in the French text. While \"spring\" can be synonymous with \"source\", its inclusion as a coordinate term (\"Source and Spring\") makes the description more emphatic and slightly more ornate, subtly intensifying the original statement.","The French text first states \"notre Soleil a des tâches\" (our Sun has spots) and then speculates on their nature with \"Que ce soient ou...\" (Whether they be...). The English translation restructures this to \"Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists...\", directly defining the spots with these speculative qualities rather than presenting them as hypotheses about their composition. This alters the epistemic stance from speculative to more assertive, changing how the information about sunspots is framed.","The original \"de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy\" (in the memory of a rose, only he has been seen/one has only seen him) uses a charming personification implying knowledge from limited, direct experience. The translation \"our History tells us of no other\" shifts this to a more formal, second-hand, recorded knowledge. This alters the character of the roses' understanding, diminishing the immediacy and the personified nature of their perspective as crafted by Fontenelle.","The French idiom \"être revenu de quelque chose\" (here, \"m'en voila tout à fait revenuë\") means to be completely disabused of an idea or to have thoroughly changed one's mind. The Marquise is stating she no longer holds her previous views on the immutability of celestial bodies. The English translation \"that I have e'en left them\" (implying she has abandoned them or the topic) misinterprets this idiom, significantly altering the Marquise's expressed realization and her intellectual development in the dialogue.","The French \"si on veut\" and \"que l'on veut\" use the impersonal pronoun \"on\" (one), suggesting a general agency that could include the reader or the Marquise in imagining these unknown worlds, aligning with Fontenelle's popularizing intent. The translation \"according as they please\" and \"as they please to make them\" restricts this agency specifically to \"Philosophers\" (implied \"they\" from context). This shift subtly reasserts an exclusive authority for philosophers in speculative thought, contrasting with Fontenelle's more inclusive \"on\" and potentially undermining the work's democratizing approach to knowledge."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">Quoi, s'écria-t-elle</span></span>, j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Je suis savante!</span></span> Oüy, répliquay-je, vous l'êtes assez raisonnablement, &amp; vous l'êtes avec la commodité de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra.

This alters the reader's perception of her reaction to her intellectual achievement.","The French 'Je suis savante!' (I am learned!) declares a significant intellectual, scientific accomplishment for a woman in that era. The English 'I am now a knowing Woman.' is a potentially misleading translation. In the period context, 'knowing woman' could connote shrewdness or worldly wisdom rather than the formal, scientific learning implied by 'savante'.
