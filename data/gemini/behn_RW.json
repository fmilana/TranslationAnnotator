Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir.</span></span> Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">Ce spectacle me fit resver</span></span>, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">une si aimable Dame</span></span>, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante.</span></span> Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination</span></span>, sont presque toûjours blondes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Ce n'est rien que la beauté</span></span>, repliqua-t'elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">si elle ne touche.</span></span> Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">resverie aussi douce</span></span> que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">me feroit encore mieux resver</span></span> que la plus belle nuit du monde <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">avec toute sa beauté brune.</span></span> Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">ce qui touche</span></span>, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements</span></span>, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences</span></span>; d'où cela vient-il? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">&amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver.</span></span> Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe</span></span>, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"20\">Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée.</span></span> Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle. Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"21\">je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde.</span></span> Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"22\">qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante.</span></span> Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"23\">Veritez</span></span> à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"24\">qui ne fait rire que l'esprit.</span></span> Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"25\">des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison?</span></span> Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, répliquai-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"26\">il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"27\">à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.</span></span> Cherchez ailleurs des Philosophes </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description, which I cannot well avoid, the fineness of it leading me so necessarily to it.</p> <p>P003: The Moon was about an hour high, which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, and checker'd the Paths beneath with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light; there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed: These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation; but the Presence of a Person of her Wit and Beauty hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars. Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day? I confess, said she, the Day must yield to such a Night; the day which resembles a fair Beauty, which though more sparkling, is not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night. You are very generous, Madam, said I, to give the advantage to the brown, you who are so admirably fair your self: Yet without dispute, day is the most beautiful thing in Nature; and most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair. But, said she, Beauty is insipid, if it want the pleasure and power of charming; and you must acknowledge that the brightest day that ever you saw could never have engaged you in so agreeable an Ecstasie, as you were just now like to have faln into by the powerful attractions of this Night.</p> <p>P004: I agree to what you say, Madam, said I, but I must own at the same time, that a Beauty of your complexion would give me another sort of transport than the finest Night with all the advantages obscurity can give it.</p> <p>P005: Though that were true, said she, I should not be satisfied; since those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other. How comes it, that Lovers who are the best Judges of what is pleasing and touching, do always address themselves to the Night, in all their Songs and Elegies? I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that? The silence and gloom of the Night, said I, inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing. Besides, the Scene of the Universe by day-light appears too Uniform, we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts. Sir, replied Madam la Marqueise, I have always felt those effects of Night you tell me of, I love the Stars, and could be heartily angry with the Sun for taking them from my sight. Ah, cry'd I, I cannot forgive his taking from me the sight of all those Worlds that are there. Worlds, said she, what Worlds? And looking earnestly upon me, asked me again, what I meant? I ask your Pardon, Madam, said I, I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness. What weakness, said she, more earnestly than before? Alass, said I, I am sorry that I must confess I have imagined to my self, that every Star may perchance be another World, yet I would not swear that it is so; but I will believe it to be true, because that Opinion is so pleasant to me, and gives me very diverting Idea's, which have fixed themselves delightfully in my Imaginations, and 'tis necessary that even solid Truth should have it's agreeableness. Well, said she, since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it; I will believe whatever you please concerning the Stars, if I find it pleasant. Ah, Madam, said I, hastily, it is not such a Pleasure as you find in one of Mullier's Plays; it is a Pleasure that is-I know not where, in our Reason, and which only transports the Mind. What, replied she, do you think me then incapable of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind? I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars. Ah, Madam, cry'd I, I shall never indure to be reproach'd with that neglect of my own happiness, that in a Grove at ten a Clock of the Night, I talk'd of nothing but Philosophy, to the greatest Beauty in the World; no, Madam, search for Philosophy some where else.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description, which I cannot well avoid, the fineness of it leading me so necessarily to it. </p><p>P003: The Moon was about an hour high, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, and checker'd the Paths beneath with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light;</span></span> there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation</span></span>; but the Presence of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">a Person of her Wit and Beauty</span></span> hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars.

It also expands 'fond bleu' (blue background) to 'deep Azure Field,' adding 'deep' to describe the shade and 'Field' to characterize the background as a vast expanse, thereby making visual details more explicit.","The French 'resver' (to daydream, to muse) is translated as 'silent Contemplation'. The addition of 'silent' and the choice of 'Contemplation' make explicit the specific, quiet nature of the narrator's mental state, which is only implied by the more general term 'resver'.","The French 'une si aimable Dame' (such a lovely/amiable lady) is rendered as 'a Person of her Wit and Beauty.' The translator explicitly states the qualities (wit and beauty) that contribute to the Marquise being 'aimable,' whereas the source leaves these qualities implied by the general adjective.","The translator adds the clause 'who is a true Emblem of the Night,' explicitly stating a symbolic relationship between the brunette beauty and the night that was only metaphorically implied in the source's direct comparison.","The phrase 'qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination' (who are what is most beautiful in the imagination) is significantly expanded to 'which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind.' This addition explicitly details the perceived creative process and superlative nature attributed to these heroines, going beyond the simpler French phrasing.","The French 'Ce n'est rien que la beauté' (Beauty is nothing) is rendered as 'Beauty is insipid.' The word 'insipid' explicitly describes a specific lack of vital quality in beauty, whereas 'nothing' is a more general negation of value.","The concise French 'si elle ne touche' (if it does not touch/move) is expanded to 'if it want the pleasure and power of charming.' This spells out the specific qualities or effects ('pleasure,' 'power of charming') that 'touching' beauty possesses, making the abstract concept more concrete and explicit.","The French 'resverie aussi douce' (such a sweet reverie/daydream) is translated as 'so agreeable an Ecstasie.' 'Ecstasie' describes a more intense and specific state of rapturous emotion than the general 'resverie,' thereby making the narrator's potential state more explicit and heightened.","The phrase 'à la veuë de cette belle nuit' (at the sight of this beautiful night) is rendered as 'by the powerful attractions of this Night.' The translation explicitly states 'powerful attractions' as the cause of the effect on the narrator, a causal link that was only implied by the mere sight of the 'belle nuit.'","The French 'me feroit encore mieux resver' (would make me daydream/muse even better) is translated as 'would give me another sort of transport.' 'Transport' denotes a more specific and intense emotional state than 'resver,' making the potential effect of the blonde beauty on the narrator more explicit.","The French 'avec toute sa beauté brune' (with all its brunette beauty), referring to the night, is translated as 'with all the advantages obscurity can give it.' The translator explicitly interprets the metaphorical 'beauté brune' of the night as the 'advantages of obscurity,' spelling out a connection and characteristic only suggested in the source.","The French 'ce qui touche' (that which touches/moves) is translated as 'what is pleasing and touching.' The addition of 'pleasing' explicitly broadens and clarifies the criteria by which lovers judge, making the nature of 'what touches' more defined.","The source states 'Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements' (The night must indeed have their thanks). The translation expands this with an explicit reason: 'for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs,' clarifying why lovers thank the night.","The source implies the night is a confidante: 'elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences' (she also has all their complaints; the day does not attract their confidences). The target makes this role explicit by stating the night is 'as a true Confident of all their Entrigues,' clearly defining its function.","The source implies the night inspires 'quelque chose de triste & de passionné' by stating the day does not. The target makes this explicit: 'The silence and gloom of the Night...inspires...thoughts very passionate and languishing,' and further adds the character 'the restless Sigher' and specifies 'silence and gloom' as causal agents of this inspiration.","The translator adds a substantial elaboration comparing day and night: 'which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self;'. This extended contrast and detailing of the day's nature versus the night's is an explicit addition not present in the more concise source.","The French 'on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver' (one is so mad that one dreams/muses better, because one flatters oneself to be then in all of Nature the only person busy dreaming/musing) is rephrased as 'we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing.' The translation explicitly details the nature of these thoughts ('extravagant and easing') and the psychological state ('vain enough'), offering a more specific interpretation of the source's 'si fou' (so mad) and 'resve mieux' (dreams/muses better).","The French 'un Soleil, & une voûte bleüe' (a Sun, and a blue vault) is rendered as 'one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent.' The translation explicitly adds descriptive details: 'Great Luminary' emphasizes the sun's importance, 'Arched Vault' specifies the sky's shape, 'Azure' defines the blue's quality, and 'of a Vast Extent' highlights its scale.","The French 'favorise la resverie, & un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir' (favors reverie, and a certain disorder of thoughts into which one does not fall without pleasure) is translated as 'which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts.' The target explicitly names 'roving Fancies' as the mental faculty involved and specifies 'silent thoughts' as the outcome, a more concrete interpretation of the source's general 'resverie' and 'desordre de pensées'.","The direct French 'Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, & aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée' (You set me on my folly, and my imagination immediately escaped/ran off) is rephrased more elaborately as 'I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness.' This translation makes explicit the involuntary nature ('insensibly led') of the admission and offers a gentler framing ('fond discovery') for his 'folie,' which is also softened to 'weakness.'","The colloquial French idiom 'je me suis mis dans la teste' (literally, I've put into my head, meaning I've got it into my head) is translated as 'I have imagined to my self.' The target explicitly names the cognitive process ('imagined'), which is implied by the French idiom, thus making the act of forming the idea more formal and specific.","The French 'qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante' (which has settled/placed itself in my mind in a cheerful/laughing manner) is rendered as 'which have fixed themselves delightfully in my Imaginations.' The target uses 'fixed themselves' to suggest a more permanent establishment and 'delightfully' to make the pleasant quality more explicit and intense.","The French 'Veritez' (Truths) is translated as 'solid Truth.' The addition of the adjective 'solid' explicitly qualifies the nature of Truth, emphasizing its substantiality and reliability, an aspect implied but not overtly stated in the original.","The French 'qui ne fait rire que l'esprit' (which only makes the mind/intellect laugh) is translated as 'which only transports the Mind.' The target replaces the metaphorical 'makes laugh' with 'transports,' explicitly describing a more profound, elevating, or ecstatic intellectual effect rather than simple mental amusement.","The concise French 'des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison' (pleasures that are only in reason) is expanded to 'of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind.' This addition explicitly describes the function and effect of these pleasures (to entertain reason, to treat the mind), details that were only implied by their location 'in reason' in the source.","The source states 'il ne me sera point reproché que... j'aye parlé de Philosophie' (I will not be reproached for having spoken of Philosophy). The translation adds 'with that neglect of my own happiness,' explicitly stating the underlying reason why talking philosophy in that romantic setting would be reproachable from a personal, gallant perspective – it implies neglecting a potential romantic opportunity for happiness.","The French 'à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse' (to the most amiable/lovable person I know) is translated as 'to the greatest Beauty in the World.' The target shifts the description from general 'amiability' (loveliness of character) to a superlative and specific physical attribute ('greatest Beauty'), making the compliment more explicit in its focus on appearance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">il fallut ceder.</span></span> Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">de Physique</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin</span></span>, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; &amp; les Planètes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des mondes.

This explicitly details the intensity ('passionate thirst') and the domain ('of the Mind') of the curiosity, which was only implied in the original.","The French 'les yeux mauvais' (bad eyes) is translated as 'the weakness of the Organs of the Body.' This generalizes from the specific 'eyes' to 'Organs of the Body' and specifies the defect as 'weakness,' making the physiological limitation more explicit and philosophical.","The French 'un grand Spectacle' (a grand spectacle/show) is rendered as 'a great Scene, or Representation.' The addition of 'or Representation' explicitly clarifies that 'Spectacle' refers to a theatrical presentation, making the nature of the analogy more precise.","The French 'comment tout cela joue' (how all that works/plays out) is translated as 'how all those Motions that we see there, are performed.' This spells out that 'cela' (that) refers to 'those Motions that we see there' and clarifies that 'joue' (plays/works) means how they 'are performed,' making the reference more concrete.","The French 's'inquiète d'un Vol... & qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté' (is concerned about/by a flight... and who absolutely wants to figure out how this flight was executed) is expanded to 'troubles himself with the consideration how those flights are managed... and who resolves at any rate to find out the contrivance of them'. This explicates the nature of the concern ('consideration how...managed') and rephrases 'démêler comment' (figure out how) with the more specific 'find out the contrivance', detailing the engineer's analytical process.","The French 'les cordes' (the ropes), used metonymically for hidden mechanisms, is expanded into the list 'the Ropes, Pullies, Wheels and Weights.' This makes the implied complexity of the stage machinery explicit by itemizing its components.","The French 'les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux' (the Machines that Nature presents to our eyes) is translated as 'the different Scenes represented to us by Nature.' This explicitly links Nature's workings to observable phenomena ('Scenes represented'), reinforcing the spectacle metaphor and clarifying that these 'Machines' are the effects we see, not just hidden causes.","The French 'sont parfaitement bien cachées' (are perfectly well hidden) is expanded to 'are so well hid both from our sight and understanding.' The addition 'both from our sight and understanding' explicitly states the two distinct ways (perceptual and conceptual) in which the mechanisms are concealed.","The French 'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers' (one/people spent a long time guessing what caused the movements of the Universe) is rendered as 'it was a long time before mankind could so much as guess at the Causes that moved the vast Frame of the Universe.' The translation specifies 'on' as 'mankind,' elevates 'ce qui causoit' to 'the Causes' (capitalized), and describes 'l'Univers' as 'the vast Frame of the Universe,' making the statement more grandiose and the entities involved more explicit.","The French 'tous les Sages' (all the Wise Men) is translated as 'the Ancient Philosophers.' This explicitly identifies the 'Sages' as philosophers and specifies their historical period ('Ancient'), which was contextually implied in the original.","The French 'les cordes' (the ropes), referring to stage mechanisms, is translated as 'the Ropes and Pullies.' The addition of 'Pullies' makes the type of machinery more explicit than the general term 'ropes' alone would convey.","The French 'comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé' (how the back of the stage was set up/arranged) is rendered as 'of the contrivance of the Machine behind the Scenes,'. The translation introduces 'contrivance' and 'Machine,' explicitly characterizing the backstage setup as a deliberately engineered mechanical system, an idea merely implied by 'disposé' (arranged).","The French 'perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité' (discredited all of Antiquity / caused Antiquity to lose its reputation) is translated as 'intirely ruined the Reputation of the Ancients.' The adverb 'intirely' is added, explicitly stating the totality of the ruin to Antiquity's reputation, making the implied degree of damage explicit.","The French 'A la fin Descartes, & quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit' (At last/Finally Descartes, & some other Moderns came, who said) is translated as 'In our Age Des Cartes, and some other Moderns would say'. The addition of 'In our Age' explicitly situates the modern philosophers' contribution within a contemporary timeframe relative to the new science, making the historical shift from ancient thought more direct.","The French 'Phaéton monte' (Phaeton goes up/ascends) is translated as 'Phaetons's flight upward.' The addition of 'flight' explicitly characterizes the method of ascent, making the description more vivid and consistent with earlier mentions of Phaeton's 'Vol' (flight).","The French 'un corps' (a body) is translated as 'any corporeal being.' The adjective 'corporeal' explicitly clarifies that 'corps' refers to a physical, material entity, in line with the philosophical and scientific language of the period.","The French 'qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps' (that a body moves [itself], if it is not pushed by another body) is rendered as 'that any corporeal being moves it self, unless it be set on Motion, or pusht by another Body'. The addition of 'unless it be set on Motion' before 'or pusht' explicitly clarifies the new mechanical principle that a body is inert and moves only when acted upon by an external force.","The French pronoun 'il' in 'qu'il monte ou qu'il descende' (that it ascends or descends), referring to 'un corps' (a body), is translated as 'that any heavy thing ascends or descends.' This makes explicit the relevant property of the body ('heavy') in the context of movement influenced by counterweights or springs.","The French 'par l'effet d'un contrepoids' (by the effect of a counterweight) is significantly expanded to 'without a counter-poise equal with it in weight to balance it.' This addition explicitly explains the functional mechanism of a counterweight (its equal weight and balancing action), which was only implied by 'l'effet de' (the effect of).","The French idiomatic phrase 'A ce compte' (literally 'by this count,' meaning 'in that case' or 'by that reckoning') is translated as 'By what you say.' This makes explicit that the Marquise's deduction is a direct consequence of the philosopher's immediately preceding statements, clarifying the conversational link.","The French 'l'arrangement des parties' (the arrangement of the parts) is translated as 'the just and equal disposal of its Parts.' The adjectives 'just and equal' are added, explicitly detailing the presumed qualities (precision, balance, order) of this arrangement necessary for the universe to function like a clock, a core idea of the mechanical philosophy.","The French 'depuis qu'ils l'avoient connu' (since they had known it / gotten to know it) is translated as 'since they believed they knew it better.' The translator adds 'believed' and 'better,' which explicitly introduces a subjective element to their knowledge and specifies a comparative degree, subtly questioning the certainty or accuracy of their understanding.","The French 'un faux Merveilleux' (a false Marvelous/Wonder) is translated as 'some false Principle or other of Admiration.' This interprets and expands the concise noun phrase by explicitly identifying the 'faux Merveilleux' as a cognitive 'Principle' and specifying its nature as one 'of Admiration,' thus clarifying the psychological basis of this misguided awe.","The French 'une espece de Magie' (a kind of Magic) is translated as 'a kind of Miracle.' This choice explicitly categorizes the misunderstood aspects of Nature as 'Miracles,' which, in the context of respecting obscurity, implies something divinely incomprehensible rather than mere trickery ('Magie'), aligning with a resistance to rational explanation.","The French 'entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire' (literally 'to enter into all that I want to tell you') is translated as 'to comprehend all I have to say to you.' The verb 'comprehend' makes explicit the implied intellectual engagement and goal of understanding that 'entrer dans' suggests in this context.","The French 'que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, & à vous montrer le Monde.' (that I believe I only have to draw the curtain, and show you the World) is translated as 'that without further Preface, I need only draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.' The addition of 'without further Preface' makes explicit the implication that drawing the curtain signifies the conclusion of introductory remarks and the beginning of the main scientific exposition."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

The translation \"their proper Sphere\" makes this specific cosmological concept explicit, clarifying the model implied by \"Ciel\" in this context.","Similarly to the previous instance, \"Ciel\" (Heaven/Sky) in the phrase \"attachées à un même Ciel\" (attached to the same Heaven/Sky) implicitly refers to a celestial sphere in the traditional astronomical models. The translation \"fixt to any one Sphere\" makes this underlying cosmological framework explicit.","The French \"elles se regardent diversement\" (literally \"they look at each other differently\" or \"are in different positions relative to each other\") is rendered as \"they are in different Aspects, one to another.\" The term \"Aspects\" is a specific astronomical term (e.g., conjunction, opposition, trine, square) for the angular relationships between celestial bodies, making the technical implication of the French phrase explicit.","The French \"figurent diversement ensemble\" (they form different configurations together) is expanded to \"according as they are in conjunction, or at distance, they make different Figures.\" The translation makes explicit the *manner* in which planets form different figures by providing examples of astronomical configurations (conjunction, distance), which were only implied by the general statement in the source.","The French \"Le Chariot\" (The Wain/Cart) is a common name for a well-known asterism (the Big Dipper/Plough). The translation \"Charles's-Wain, or the Constellation of the Great Bear\" first provides an equivalent English vernacular name (\"Charles's-Wain\") and then adds the formal astronomical designation (\"the Constellation of the Great Bear\"). This explicitly identifies the asterism for an English audience who might not recognize \"Le Chariot\" or even \"Charles's-Wain\" alone, and clarifies its astronomical identity, which is implied by Fontenelle's use of a known celestial object as an example.","The French \"les choses\" (the things), in a context where the discussion revolves around astronomical observations of the sky, implicitly refers to the objects being observed (stars, planets, etc.). The translation \"the Celestial Bodies\" makes this reference explicit, specifying the nature of \"the things\" being discussed.","The French verb \"confondoient\" (confounded, muddled), describing the effect of Nile floods on field boundaries, implies that these boundaries became indistinct and their integrity lost. The translation \"confounded and removed\" makes explicit the consequence of physical displacement or obliteration (\"removed\") of these boundaries, a strong potential outcome implied by \"confondoient\" in this destructive natural context.","The French phrase \"les bornes des tous les champs\" (the boundaries/limits of all the fields) is translated as \"the Limits and the Land-marks of the several Possessions of the Inhabitants.\" The translator makes implicit details explicit: \"bornes\" (boundaries) are specified further as including physical \"Land-marks\" (which floods would affect), and \"champs\" (fields) are described more fully as \"Possessions of the Inhabitants,\" clarifying their socio-economic status (privately owned land), which was implied by the context of needing exact measures to distinguish one's field from a neighbor's."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P007: Je suis bien aise, dit la Marquise, d'avoir appris cette genealogie des Sciences, &amp; je voy bien qu'il faut que je m'en tienne à l'Astronomie. La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus intéressée que je ne l'ai, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes.</span></span> La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">toutes ces bizarreries</span></span>. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil</span></span>, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation. Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire.</span></span> Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles</span></span>, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy. </p><p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il? Avez-vous remarqué, lui répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? Elle va vers le but où elle est envoyée, &amp; en même temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-même, en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut. La Terre fait la même chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre</span></span>, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le côté où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse. Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la même cause. Les Planètes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nôtre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planètes marchent aussi; cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard, &amp; nous fait paroître dans leur cours des bizarreries dont il n'est pas nécessaire que je vous parle. Il suffit que vous sachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irrégulier dans les Planètes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont notre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fond elles sont toutes très-reglées. Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, on ne l'a guere ménagée, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité.. Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures. </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'un gros Navire monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises? Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes. Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fût cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matière céleste, &amp; ne pas s'y laisser emporter? C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature</span></span>. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">saving</span></span>, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</p> <p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">(which is not near the South or North-Poles)</span></span> loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy.

Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun</span></span>: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","explanations":["The French 'elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures.' (it turns on itself in twenty-four hours.) is translated as 'it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis;'. The translator makes the implicit astronomical concept explicit by adding 'upon its own Axis,' clarifying the nature of Earth's rotation. The phrase 'once every' also specifies the frequency more precisely.","The French 'toutes ces bizarreries' (all these oddities/peculiarities) is translated as 'all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature.' The translator expands the general term 'bizarreries' into more formal, scientific language ('Phaenomena's') and then clarifies it ('Appearances in Nature'), making explicit that these refer to observable natural events, reflecting the Scientific Revolution's emphasis on empirical observation.","The French 'que Venus & Mercure tournent autour du Soleil' (that Venus & Mercury turn around the Sun) is translated as 'that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth.' The translator adds the clause 'and not round the Earth,' making explicit the crucial contrast with the geocentric Ptolemaic system. This addition reinforces the core argument of the Copernican model being popularized.","The French source first states Copernicus died, then separately mentions his desire to avoid contradictions ('Il ne voulut point essuyer...') and how he 'skilfully got out of the affair' ('se tira habilement d'affaire'). The English translation rephrases this by explicitly stating the *reason* for his death immediately before mentioning it: 'That he might not be troubled to answer... he wisely left the World, and died.' This makes Copernicus's motive for the timing of his death explicit, framing it as a deliberate strategy to avoid debate, an interpretation that is less direct in the source.","The French 'Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, & le recouvre' (Thus in twenty-four hours each part of the Earth loses the Sun, & recovers it) is expanded to 'so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun'. The translator adds '(which is not near the South or North-Poles),' introducing a scientific precision about Earth's polar regions not in the source. Additionally, 'one natural Day' clarifies 'vingt-quatre heures,' and 'sight of the Sun' specifies what is lost and recovered.","The French 'Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes.' (Above all that was the Heaven of the fixed Stars.) is translated as 'and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars:'. By changing 'Ciel' (Heaven) to 'Sphere,' the translator makes explicit the geometric conceptualization of the celestial realm in the Ptolemaic system, where fixed stars were thought to be embedded in a solid, rotating sphere, a detail pertinent to the historical cosmological model being discussed.","The French 'S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles' (If it [the Sun] did not erase/blot out the Stars) is translated as 'if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight'. The translator explicitly adds the mechanism 'the brightness of his Rays' to explain *how* the Sun causes the stars to become invisible during the day, clarifying a physical phenomenon that was only implied by the verb 'effaçoit'."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P011: Mais, répliqua-t-elle encore, comment la Terre avec tout <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">son poids</span></span> se soûtient- elle sur votre matiere celeste qui doit être bien legere, puisqu'elle est si fluide?

The translator adds the adjective 'vast' to make explicit the implied great magnitude of the Earth's weight, which Fontenelle leaves to the reader's understanding.","The simple reporting clause 'répondis-je' (I replied) is rendered as 'answered I, Madam'. The translator adds the vocative 'Madam,' making the formal address to the Marquise explicit within the philosopher's speech, whereas the French implies the addressee from the dialogue context.","The French 'notre gros Vaisseau' (our big ship) is translated as 'the First-Rate Ship, I spoke of'. 'First-Rate Ship' specifies the type and importance of the ship, making 'gros' more concrete and technically specific. The clause 'I spoke of' explicitly clarifies a previous reference implied by 'notre' (our).","Referring to the ship, 'avec tout son poids' (with all its weight) is translated as 'with all its Lading'. The translator specifies 'Lading' (cargo), making explicit the assumption that the ship's significant weight includes its cargo, rather than just the vessel itself.","The phrase 'le gros Vaisseau' (the big ship) is rendered as 'your First-Rate Frigat'. 'First-Rate' again specifies quality, and 'Frigat' names a specific type of warship, making the general term 'Vaisseau' more concrete. The use of 'your' also makes explicit the idea that this is the philosopher's example directed at the Marquise.","The French 'comme font les Indiens' (as the Indians do/make it) is translated as 'as the Indians fansie it is'. The addition of 'fansie it is' explicitly frames the Indian belief as imaginative or unreal, thereby making the philosopher's (and likely Fontenelle's) rationalist, dismissive stance more overt than the original, more neutral phrasing.","The French 's'écria-t-elle' (she cried out) is translated as 'cry'd Madam la Marquiese'. The translator explicitly names 'Madam la Marquiese', clarifying the identity of 'elle' (she), which is only implied by the narrative context in the source.","The phrase 'fait de bons fondemens' (made good foundations) is translated as 'by resting upon a solid Foundation'. The addition 'by resting upon' explicitly states the function or mechanism of these foundations. 'Solid' also makes 'bons' (good) more specific in the context of structural support.","The French 'en peril de se mouvoir' (in peril of moving) is rendered as 'in any danger of falling'. The translator specifies 'falling' as the type of movement feared for the Earth, making the general threat implied by 'se mouvoir' more concrete and directly related to the need for support.","The French 'ils doubleroient les Elephans' (they would double the elephants) is translated as 'they wou'd quickly double the number of their Elephants'. The addition of 'quickly' makes explicit the implied urgency and immediacy of the Indians' hypothetical reaction to perceived danger.","The concise French expression 'Cela le meriteroit bien' (That would well deserve it) is significantly expanded to 'They wou'd have all the reason in the World to do so'. This expansion explicitly spells out and emphasizes the strength of justification for the action, which is more understated in the original.","The phrase 'pour dormir en assurance' (to sleep in security/assurance) is translated as 'to sleep in quiet, without fear of falling'. The addition 'without fear of falling' explicitly states the specific threat (the Earth falling) from which they would be secured, a detail implied by 'assurance' in this context.","The French 'des idées réjouissantes' (joyful/cheering ideas) is translated as 'very pleasant and agreeable Idea's'. The doublet 'very pleasant and agreeable' expands on 'réjouissantes,' explicitly detailing the qualities of the ideas rather than relying on a single, more general adjective.","The phrase 'des Villes à longues aiguilles qui ont des Croissants' (cities with long needles that have Crescents) is translated as 'some with their long small-pointed Pyramids, and Half-moons on their tops'. 'Longues aiguilles' (long needles, referring to minarets) is made more descriptively explicit as 'long small-pointed Pyramids'. Additionally, 'on their tops' explicitly states the location of the crescents, which was implied for such architectural features.","The phrase 'de grands Païs qui n'ont que des Cabanes' (large countries/lands that only have cabins/huts) is rendered as 'spacious Fields, without Towns, only Tents and Huts'. 'Grands Païs' is interpreted as 'spacious Fields,' and the clarifying detail 'without Towns' is added, explicitly describing these lands as sparsely populated and non-urban, an idea only implied by them having 'only Cabanes.' 'Tents and Huts' also slightly expands and specifies 'Cabanes'.","The French 'dans ce même lieu, à le prendre dans l'air' (in this same place, taking it/considering it in the air) is made more explicit as 'that space of Air which our Bodies fill'. The translator concretizes the abstract notion of a fixed point in absolute space by linking it to the physical volume occupied by the speakers' bodies.","The simple French 'nous y revenons' (we return there) is expanded to 'we return hither, ... to our own place again'. The additions 'hither' and 'to our own place again' make the return to the specific original location more explicit and emphatic than the concise pronoun 'y' (there)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: Copernic, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">luy</span></span> répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.

The translation explicitly identifies her by adding the direct address \"Madam\" within \"said I, Madam.\"","The French \"moins de gayeté\" (less gaiety), part of \"avec moins de gayeté\" (with less gaiety), implies a more serious disposition. The translation makes this explicit by specifying \"more Gravity\" and further clarifies the emotional tone by adding \"but less Pleasure,\" expanding the original condensed meaning.","The French phrase \"il se pourra trouver en ce lieu-là quelque Vaisseau\" means a vessel might be found there, implying its presence. The translation \"there will be sailing some Ships\" makes explicit the activity of \"sailing,\" which was only implied for a vessel in the ocean.","The source refers to a specific indigenous group, \"des Iroquois.\" The translation changes this to \"the Canibals,\" explicitly labeling them by a practice (cannibalism, which Fontenelle then describes them performing). This makes an implied or associated characteristic the primary identifier, thus re-writing the reference.","The French pronominal adverb \"s'en\" in \"ne s'en pas soucier\" (literally 'not to care about it') is vague. The translation replaces \"s'en\" with the explicit phrase \"at what they suffer\" (in \"unconcern'd at what they suffer\"), clarifying that 'it' refers to the prisoners' suffering.","The French \"tout\" (everything), in the phrase \"accorder tout au premier venu\" (to grant everything to the first comer), is general. The translation specifies this as \"any Favour\" (in \"granting any Favour to the first Comer\"), making explicit the implied nature of what is granted, likely amorous or social favours in context.","The French \"de petits Tartares\" (Little Tartars) is a historical term that could be somewhat general. The translation \"the Crim, or Little Tartars\" adds \"the Crim\" (Crimean), providing an explicit geographical and ethnic specification that clarifies information potentially only implied or assumed as known by the original audience.","The French verb phrase \"iront voler\" (will go to steal / will be stealing), from \"qui iront voler des Femmes,\" describes an action. The translation \"live by stealing\" (from \"who live by stealing of Wives\") makes explicit the interpretation that this theft is a habitual activity or means of livelihood.","The French \"des Femmes\" (women), from \"qui iront voler des Femmes,\" is a general term. The translation \"of Wives\" (in \"stealing of Wives\") specifies an implied future status or role for the stolen women, making an outcome explicit.","The French term \"des rêveries\" (daydreams/fantasies), from \"debiterons ... des rêveries\" (will utter/recount ... daydreams/fantasies), is open to interpretation. The translation \"talking as we do now\" (in \"perhaps talking as we do now\") explicitly connects these \"rêveries\" to the specific nature of the ongoing philosophical dialogue between the characters, clarifying the term by linking it to their immediate activity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P015: Il est assez plaisant, dit la Marquise, d'imaginer ce que vous venez de me dire; mais si je voyois tout cela d'en haut, je voudrais avoir la liberté de hâter ou d'arrêter le mouvement de la Terre, selon que les objets me plairont plus ou moins, &amp; je vous assure que je ferais passer bien vite ceux qui s'embarrassent de Politique, ou qui mangent leurs Ennemis; mais il y en a d'autres pour qui j'aurois de la curiosité.

This explicitation provides a more detailed account of the cocoon's texture and composition by specifying that the silk is \"compact\" and \"wrought together,\" thus spelling out the characteristics of the \"soye fort serrée.\"","The French text uses an analogy: the Earth is covered by air, and states, \"& toute la Coque de Ver à soye tourne en même temps\" (AND the whole silkworm cocoon turns at the same time), implying the Earth and its air also turn.

This explicates a social convention of polite address to the Marquise that is absent in the French original, adding a layer of formality or courtesy typical of English dialogue of the period.","The French \"tous ces petits mouvements particuliers\" (all these small particular movements) is general. The English \"these Troubles and Commotions\" explicitly links these \"movements\" to the \"grandes Guerres\" and \"grande agitation\" (terrible Wars, strange Commotions) mentioned by the Marquise in the preceding lines, thus making the referent of the \"movements\" explicit.","The French \"à ne vous rien celer\" (to hide nothing from you) is translated with an expansion. While \"to be plain with you\" is an idiomatic equivalent for the general idea of not concealing, the additional clause \"and that I may keep none of my Doubts from you\" explicitly specifies *what* is not being concealed (her doubts), whereas the French \"rien\" (nothing) is more general.","The French \"qu'il ne laissera pas\" (that it will not leave [a mark]) implies an impersonal agent (\"il\" - it) related to the Earth's movement or general circumstances. The English translation \"but Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us\" explicitly introduces \"Nature\" as a personified agent that would act deliberately, a specification not present in the source.","The French pronoun \"le\" (it) in \"à laquelle on le reconnaisse?\" (by which one recognizes it?) anaphorically refers to \"le mouvement de la Terre\" (the Earth's movement) from the preceding context. The English translation \"the turning round of so vast a Body\" explicitly spells out this referent with a descriptive noun phrase, replacing the pronoun to enhance clarity.","The French \"vous moralisez\" (you are moralizing) is made more specific by translating it as \"do you begin to speak of Moral Philosophy.\" This explicitation specifies the domain of the \"moralizing\" as the formal discipline or area of \"Moral Philosophy,\" expanding on the general act of moralizing.","The French \"Physique\" (Physics), in Fontenelle's time, referred to Natural Philosophy or the study of nature. The translation \"of that which is altogether natural?\" explicates this broader historical meaning of \"Physique,\" clarifying that it refers to the natural world in general, rather than solely modern, more restricted physics.","The French \"cela s'appelle bâiller\" (literally \"that is called yawning\") is an impersonal, metaphorical expression suggesting that the preceding topic (moralizing about physics) is boring or out of place. The English translation \"But I perceive you are sleepy, and begin to yawn;\" reinterprets this by making it a direct, personal observation about the philosopher (the \"you\" addressed by the Marquise), explicitly attributing sleepiness and yawning to him, rather than a general comment on the discussion.","The French \"pour la premiere fois\" (for the first time/occasion) is rendered as \"for the first Night.\" Given the established literary convention of the \"Entretiens\" (Conversations) as evening dialogues, the translator makes the implied temporal setting of this \"first occasion\" explicit by specifying \"Night.\"","The French \"Monde\" (World), particularly in astronomical or cosmological contexts of Fontenelle's era, often carried the meaning of the \"Universe.\" The translation \"Universe\" makes this broader, cosmographical scope explicit, removing potential ambiguity with \"world\" as just Earth.","The French \"autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planètes\" (around which all the other Planets turned) is a descriptive clause stating a feature of Tycho Brahe's model. The English translation \"as he did the other Planets to turn round the Sun\" explicitly attributes the design or proposition of this planetary motion around the Sun to Tycho Brahe's agency (\"he did\"), information about direct agency that is less prominent in the French phrasing.","The French \"la Marquise\" simply uses the title and implies the character. The English translation \"my Lady Marquiese\" adds the honorific \"my Lady,\" which explicates a level of social deference or formal address common in English of that period, a nuance not overtly expressed in the French.","The French anaphoric pronoun \"en\" (from it/them) in \"on n'en pouvait pas exempter\" (one could not exempt from it) refers implicitly to the act of turning around the Sun. The English translation replaces \"from it\" with \"from that Labour,\" explicitly naming the implied action (\"turning\") and characterizing it as \"Labour,\" thus adding specificity and a connotation of toil.","The French \"quand on avoit bien envie de la soûtenir\" (when one had a strong desire to support it [the Earth's immobility]) describes a strong inclination. The English translation \"if one had a mind to undertake that Argument\" makes explicit the *manner* or *action* of such support, specifying it as \"to undertake that Argument,\" which is an implied method of intellectual support in such a discussion.","The French \"celuy de Copernic\" (that of Copernicus) uses a demonstrative pronoun \"celuy\" (that one), which implicitly refers to Copernicus's system or model. The English translation \"the Opinion of Copernicus\" makes this referent explicit by adding the noun \"Opinion\" (in the sense of a viewpoint or system), thereby clarifying what \"that [one]\" signifies.","The French \"la simplicité dont il est\" (its simplicity / the simplicity it has) focuses on one quality. The English translation \"its Simplicity and Easiness\" adds \"Easiness.\" In the context of scientific models, simplicity often implies easiness of understanding or use. The translator makes this associated quality, \"Easiness,\" explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: SECOND SOIR.

Il y aura quelqu'un qui luy representera qu'à la vérité quand on est sur les Tours de Notre-Dame, on ne voit pas les Habitans de Saint-Denis, mais que l'éloignement en est cause; que tout ce qu'on peut voir de Saint-Denis ressemble fort à Paris, que Saint Denis a des Clochers, des Maisons, des Murailles, &amp; qu'il pourrait bien encore ressembler à Paris pour ce qui est d'être habité. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Tout cela ne gagnera rien sur mon Bourgeois</span></span>, il s'obstinera toûjours à soûtenir que Saint-Denis n'est point habité, puisqu'il n'y voit personne.

She sent me word, that now she was pretty well accustom'd to the Motion of the Earth, and that Copernicus himself cou'd not have rested better that Night than she did. A little after this, there came Company to visit my Lady, which, according to the nauseous Country-fashion, stay'd till the Evening, and yet we thought our selves happy that we were so easily rid of 'em then, since, according to the custom of the Country, they might have prolong'd their Visit till the next Day; but they were so civil, as not to do it; so that Madam the Marquiese and I found our selves at liberty. In the Evening we went again to the Park, and the Conversation began as it ended before, of our System: My Lady Marquiese had comprehended 'em so well, that she wou'd not be at the pains to re-assume any thing of what had pass'd, but press'd me to lead her to something that was new. Well, said I, since the Sun, which is now immoveable, and no longer a Planet; and that the Earth, that moves round the Sun, is now one, be not surpriz'd if I tell you, the Moon is another Earth, and is, by all appearance, inhabited. Said she, I never heard of the Moon's being inhabited, but as a Fable. So it may be still, said I; I concern my self no further in these Matters, than Men use to do in Civil Wars; where the Uncertainty of what may be, makes People still entertain a Correspondence with the adverse Party: As for me, tho' I see the Moon inhabited, I live very civilly with those that do not believe it; and I carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, upon occasion, with Honour go over to their side who have the better; but still they gain some considerable Advantage over us.

It may be, some body standing by, wou'd represent to him, That it was true, one cou'd not see the Inhabitants of St. Denis from our Lady's Church, but that the distance was the cause of it; yet that all we cou'd see of St. Denis, was very like to Paris; for St. Denis had Steeples, Houses and Walls; and that it might resemble Paris in every thing else, and be inhabited as well as it. All these Arguments wou'd not prevail upon my Citizen; who wou'd continue still obstinate in maintaining, that St. Denis was not inhabited, because he saw none of the People. The Moon is our St. Denis, and we the Citizens of Paris, that never went out of our own Town. Ah, interrupted the Marquiese, you do us wrong; we are not so foolish as your Citizens of Paris: Since he sees that St. Denis is so like to Paris in every thing, he must have lost his Reason, if he did not think it was inhabited: But for the Moon, that's nothing like the Earth. Have a care, Madam, said I, what you say; for if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth, you are oblig'd to believe that the Moon is inhabited. I acknowledge, said she, if you do that, I must yield; and your Looks are so assur'd, that you frighten me already: The two different Motions of the Earth, which wou'd never have enter'd into my Thoughts, make me very apprehensive of all you say.

Alas, Madam, said I, to be enlightned, is not so great a matter as you imagine, and the Sun only is remarkable for that Quality: 'tis he alone that is enlightned of himself, by virtue of his particular Essence; but the other Planets shine only, as being enlightned by the Sun: The Sun communicates his Light to the Moon, which reflects it upon the Earth; as the Earth, without doubt, reflects it back again to the Moon, since the distance from the Moon to the Earth is the same as from the Earth to the Moon.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P018: AS soon as one could get into my Lady Marquiese's Apartment, I sent to know how she did, and how she had slept that Night in turning round.

The translation \"and yet we thought our selves happy that we were so easily rid of 'em then\" makes explicit the underlying feeling of relief and annoyance that was only implied by the context of \"l'ennuyeuse coutume\" (the annoying custom). It spells out the *reason* for the 'obligation' as relief from an unwelcome presence.","The French \"la conversation ne manqua pas de tourner aussitôt sur nos Sistêmes.\" (the conversation did not fail to turn immediately to our Systems) implies a continuation. The translation \"the Conversation began as it ended before, of our System:\" explicitly states that the current conversation is a direct continuation of a previous one on the same topic, making a connection that was implicit.","The French \"d'en parler une seconde fois\" (to speak of it a second time), where \"en\" refers implicitly to \"nos Sistêmes\" (our Systems) or the previous discussion, is translated as \"to re-assume any thing of what had pass'd\". The translation explicitly clarifies the referent of \"en\" as the content of the previous discussion (\"what had pass'd\").","The French \"je me tiens toujours en état de me pouvoir ranger à leur opinion avec honneur, si elle avoit le dessus\" (I always keep myself in a state to be able to align with their opinion with honor, if it had the upper hand) is rendered as \"I carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, upon occasion, with Honour go over to their side who have the better\". The word \"trimmingly\" explicitly characterizes the narrator's adaptable stance using a term resonant with contemporary English political discourse, thus making explicit a specific mode of strategic pragmatism implied by the \"Guerres Civiles\" (Civil Wars) analogy.","The French \"voyci ce qui m'a mis du côté des Habitans de la Lune.\" (here is what has put me on the side of the inhabitants of the Moon) is translated as \"I'll tell you my Reasons that make me take part with the Inhabitants of the Moon:\". The addition of \"my Reasons\" explicitly clarifies that \"ce qui\" (what/that which) refers to the justifications or arguments for the narrator's stance, information that was implied but not directly stated.","The French \"Tout cela ne gagnera rien sur mon Bourgeois\" (All that will not win over my Citizen) refers back to the counter-arguments presented to the citizen. The translation \"All these Arguments wou'd not prevail upon my Citizen\" explicitly categorizes \"Tout cela\" (All that) as \"Arguments,\" clarifying the nature of the preceding discourse which was only implied.","The French \"Prenez garde, Madame\" (Take care, Madam) is a general warning. The translation \"Have a care, Madam, what you say\" makes explicit that the warning pertains specifically to the Marquise's preceding statement about the Moon not being like the Earth. It clarifies the focus of the caution, which was implicit.","The French \"qu'il n'y aura pas moyen de s'en dispenser\" (that there will be no way to avoid it [the obligation to believe]) is translated as \"if you do that, I must yield.\" The phrase \"if you do that\" explicitly links her statement of concession to the philosopher's immediately preceding condition (\"if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth\"), making a causal connection explicit that was only implied.","The French \"me rendent timide sur tout le reste\" (make me timid about all the rest) is translated as \"make me very apprehensive of all you say.\" The phrase \"of all you say\" explicitly clarifies that \"tout le reste\" (all the rest) refers to the philosopher's ongoing and future statements or arguments, making the object of her apprehension specific and explicit.","The French \"en vertu d'une nature particulière qu'il a\" (by virtue of a particular nature that it has) is translated as \"by virtue of his particular Essence.\" The term \"Essence\" specifies the \"nature particulière\" as the intrinsic, fundamental being or constitution of the Sun, making the philosophical implication of the Sun's self-luminosity more explicit than the general term \"nature.\"","The French \"elle nous la renvoye\" (it sends it back to us) uses the general verb \"renvoyer\" (to send back). The translation \"which reflects it upon the Earth\" uses the more specific scientific term \"reflects,\" thereby making explicit the physical mechanism by which the Moon returns the Sun's light, a mechanism implied by the astronomical context.","The French \"il faut que la Terre renvoye aussi à la Lune la lumière du Soleil\" (the Earth must also send back to the Moon the Sun's light) is translated as \"as the Earth, without doubt, reflects it back again to the Moon\". The verb \"renvoye\" (send back) is translated as \"reflects,\" making the physical mechanism explicit. Furthermore, \"il faut que\" (it is necessary that/it must be that), which expresses logical consequence, is rendered partly by \"without doubt,\" making the narrator's certainty about this deduction explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere du Soleil?

Or je croy que vous ne contesterez pas à la Terre cette même dureté e&amp; cette même solidité. Admirez donc ce que c'est que d'être posté avantageusement. Parce que la Lune est éloignée de nous, nous ne la voyons que comme un Corps lumineux, &amp; nous ignorons que ce soit une grosse masse, toute semblable à la Terre. Au contraire, parce que la Terre a le malheur que nous la voyons de trop prés, elle ne nous paroît qu'une grosse masse, propre seulement à fournir de la pâture aux Animaux, &amp; nous ne nous apercevons pas qu'elle est lumineuse, faute de nous pouvoir mettre à quelque distance d'elle. Cela va de la même maniere, dit la Marquise, que quand nous sommes frapés de l'éclat des Conditions; élevées au-dessus des nôtres, &amp; que nous ne voyons pas, qu'au fond elles se ressemblent toutes extrêmement. </p><p>P025: C'est la même chose, répondis-je.

Je ne me consoleray jamais, dit-elle, de l'injustice que nous faisons à la Terre, &amp; de la préoccupation trop favorable où nous sommes pour la Lune, si vous ne m'assurez que les Gens de la Lune ne connaissent pas mieux leurs avantages que nous connoissons les nôtres, &amp; qu'ils prennent notre Terre pour un Astre, sans savoir que leur habitation en est un aussi.

La Terre dit: Ce n'est pas moy qui tourne, c'est le Soleil. La Lune dit, _Ce n'est pas moy qui tremble, c'est la Terre. Il y a bien de l'erreur par tout. Je ne vous conseille pas d'entreprendre d'y rien réformer, répondis-je, il vaut mieux que vous acheviez de vous convaincre de l'entiere ressemblance de la Terre &amp; de la Lune. Représentez-vous ces deux grandes Boules suspendües dans les Cieux. Vous savez que le Soleil éclaire toûjours une moitié des Corps qui sont ronds, &amp; que l'autre moitié est dans l'ombre. Il y a donc toûjours une moitié, tant de la Terre que de la Lune, qui est éclairée du Soleil, c'est à dire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">qui a le jour, &amp; une autre moitié qui est dans la nuit</span></span>. Remarquez d'ailleurs que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">comme une Balle a moins de force &amp; de vitesse après qu'elle a été donner contre une muraille qui l'a renvoyée d'un autre côté</span></span>, de même la lumière s'affoiblit lors qu'elle a été réfléchie par quelque Corps. Cette lumière blanchâtre qui nous vient de la Lune, est la lumière même du Soleil, mais elle ne peut venir de la Lune à nous que par une réflexion. Elle a donc beaucoup perdu de la force &amp; de la vivacité qu'elle avoit lorsqu'elle étoit receüe directement sur la Lune, &amp; cette lumière éclatante que nous recevons du Soleil &amp; que la Terre reflechit sur la Lune, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">ne doit plus être qu'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée</span></span>.

Tout dépend de la manière dont la Lune &amp; la Terre se regardent. Dans les premiers jours du mois que l'on ne voit pas la Lune, c'est qu'elle est entre le Soleil &amp; nous, &amp; qu'elle marche de jour avec le Soleil. Il faut necessairement que toute sa moitié qui a le jour, soit tournée vers le Soleil, &amp; que toute sa moitié qui a la nuit, soit tournée vers nous. Nous n'avons garde de voir cette moitié qui n'a aucune lumière pour se faire voir. Mais cette moitié de la Lune qui a la nuit, étant tournée vers la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, nous voit sans être veüe, &amp; nous voit sous la même figure que nous voyons la Pleine Lune. C'est alors pour les Gens de la Lune Pleine Terre, s'il est permis de parler ainsi. Ensuite la Lune qui avance sur son Cercle d'un mois, se dégage de dessous le Soleil, &amp; commence à tourner vers nous un petit coin de sa moitié éclairée, &amp; voilà le Croissant.

You are always for the Moon, said I, and you cannot rid your self of those Remains of Kindness you have for her. Light is compos'd for little Balls, which rebound upon any solid Body, which is opaque, or obscure, and are sent back another way; whereas they pass through any thing that offers them an Opening, or Passage, in a streight Line; which is Diaphanus, or clear; such as Air and Glass: So that the Moon enlightens us, because she is an Opaque, solid Body, which retorts these little Balls upon us; and I believe you will not dispute the same Solidity to the Earth. Admire then, Madam, how advantageous it is, to be well posted; so that the Moon being at a great distance from us, we see it as an enlightned Body only, but are ignorant that 'tis a gross, solid Mass, very much like the Earth: On the other hand, the Earth having the ill luck to be seen by us too near, we consider it only as a great massy Body, fit only for the producing of Food for living Creatures. 'Tis just, said the Marquiese, as when we are struck and surpriz'd with the Splendour of Quality above our own; we do not perceive, that in the main, there's no difference between them and us. 'Tis just so, said I; and we will needs be judging of every thing; but we have the mis-fortune, still to be plac'd in a false Light: Wou'd we judge of our selves, we are too near; if of others, we are too far off: Cou'd one be plac'd between the Moon and the Earth, that wou'd be a true Station to consider both well: To this End, we ought only to be Spectators of the World, and not Inhabitants. I shall never be satisfy'd, said the Marquiese, with the Injury we do the Earth, in being too favourably engag'd for the Inhabitants of the Moon, unless you can assure me, that they are as ignorant of their Advantages, as we are of ours; and that they take our Earth for a Star, without knowing that the Globe they inhabit is one also. Be assur'd of that, Madam, said I, that the Earth appears to them to perform all the Functions of a Star: 'Tis true, they do not see the Earth describe a Circle round 'em, but that's all one; I'll explain to you what it is: That side of the Moon which was turn'd towards the Earth at the beginning of the World, has continu'd towards the Earth ever since; which still represents to us these same Eyes, Nose and Mouth, which our Imaginations fansie we see compos'd of these Spots, Lights and Shadows, which are the Surface of the Moon: Cou'd we see the other half of the Moon, 'tis possible our Fancy wou'd represent to us some other Figure. This does not argue, but the Moon turns however upon her own Axis, and takes as much time to perform that Revolution, as she does to go round the Earth in a Month. But then, when the Moon performs a part of her Revolutions on her own Axis, and that she ought to hide from us (for Example) one Cheek of this imaginary Face, and appear to us in another Position, she does at the same time perform as much of the Circle she describes in turning round the Earth; and tho' she is in a new Point of Sight or Opposition as to us, yet she represents to us still the same Cheek: So that the Moon, in regard to the Sun, and the other Planets, turns upon her own Axis; but does not so as to the Earth.</p> <p>P020: The Inhabitants of the Moon see all the other Planets rise and set in the space of fifteen Days, but they see our Earth always hanging in the same Point of the Heavens. This seeming Immovability does not very well agree with a Body that ought to pass for a Planet; but the truth is, the Earth is not in such perfection: Besides, the Moon has a certain trembling Quality, which does sometimes hide a little of her imaginary Face, and at other times shews a little of her opposite Side; and no doubt but the Inhabitants of the Moon attribute this shaking to the Earth, and believe we make a certain swinging in the Heavens, like the Pendulum of a Clock. All these Planets, said the Marquiese, are like us Mortals, who always cast our own Faults upon others: Says the Earth, It is not I that turn round, 'tis the Sun: Says the Moon, It is not I that tremble, 'tis the Earth: There are Errors and Mistakes every where. I wou'd not advise you, said I, to undertake to reform any of 'em; 'tis better that I make an end in convincing you, that the Moon is in all things like the Earth. Represent to your self these two great Globes, hanging in the Heavens; you know that the Sun does always enlighten one half of any Globe, and the other half is in the Shadow; there is therefore always one half of both Moon and Earth that is enlightned, or half Day, and the other half is still in the Darkness of Night. Be pleas'd, besides, to consider that a Ball has less force and swiftness after it re- bounds from a Wall, against which it was thrown, than it had before it touch'd the Wall, which sends it another way; so Light is not so strong, after 'tis reflected by any solid Body: This pale Light which comes to us from the Moon, is the Light of the Sun it self, but we have it only by Reflection from the Moon, and has lost a great deal of that Strength and Vivacity which it had when 'twas receiv'd by the Moon, directly from the Sun; and that bright and dazling Light which we receive from the Sun, must in the same manner appear to the Inhabitants of the Moon, after 'tis reflected by the Earth, on the Moon: So that the Surface of the Moon, which we see enlightned, and which shines upon us in the Night, is that half of the Moon that enjoys the Day, as that half of the Globe of the Earth which is enlightned by the Sun, when 'tis turn'd towards the darkened half of the Globe of the Moon, does give Light to the Inhabitants there, during their Nights. All depends upon the different Opposition and Aspects between the Moon and the Earth: The first and second Day of the Moon, we do not see her, because she is betwixt the Sun and us, and moves with the Sun by our Day; it necessarily follows, that the half of the Moon which is enlightned, is turn'd towards the Sun, and the obscure part towards the Earth; 'tis no wonder then, that we cannot see that half which is dark; but that same half of the Moon which is in Darkness, being turn'd towards the enlightned half of the Earth, the Inhabitants see us, without being seen, and the Earth appears to them, as their Full-Moon does to us; and so, if one may use the Expression, 'tis with them Full-Earth. After this, the Moon going on in her Monthly Circle, dis-engages her self from the Sun, and begins to turn towards us a part of her enlightned half, which is the Crescent; at the very same time, the darkned half of the Moon loses some share of the enlightned part of the Earth, and then the Earth is in the Wain, as to its Inhabitants.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P019: But, said the Marquiese, is the Earth as proper for reflecting the Light of the Sun, as the Moon?

'Tis just, said the Marquiese, as when we are struck and surpriz'd with the Splendour of Quality above our own; we do not perceive, that in the main, there's no difference between them and us. 'Tis just so, said I; and we will needs be judging of every thing; but we have the mis-fortune, still to be plac'd in a false Light: Wou'd we judge of our selves, we are too near; if of others, we are too far off: Cou'd one be plac'd between the Moon and the Earth, that wou'd be a true Station to consider both well: To this End, we ought only to be Spectators of the World, and not Inhabitants.

Be assur'd of that, Madam, said I, that the Earth appears to them to perform all the Functions of a Star: 'Tis true, they do not see the Earth describe a Circle round 'em, but that's all one; I'll explain to you what it is: That side of the Moon which was turn'd towards the Earth at the beginning of the World, has continu'd towards the Earth ever since; which still represents to us these same Eyes, Nose and Mouth, which our Imaginations fansie we see compos'd of these Spots, Lights and Shadows, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">which are the Surface of the Moon</span></span>: Cou'd we see the other half of the Moon, 'tis possible our Fancy wou'd represent to us some other Figure.

The target text, after translating 'solide' as 'solid Body', adds the clarification 'which is opaque, or obscure,'. This makes the implied physical property of opacity, necessary for reflecting light in this manner, explicit.","The source describes light passing through things that 'presente des ouvertures en ligne droite' (offer openings in a straight line), like air or glass. The target, after rendering this idea, adds 'which is Diaphanus, or clear;'. This explicitly states the property of transparency/diaphaneity implied by the description and examples.","The source describes the Moon as 'un Corps dur & solide' (a hard and solid body). The target translates this as 'an Opaque, solid Body'. The addition of 'Opaque' makes explicit the implied property that allows the Moon to reflect sunlight, consistent with an earlier explicitation.","The source refers to a preoccupation 'pour la Lune' (for the Moon). The target translates this as 'for the Inhabitants of the Moon', thereby making explicit that the preoccupation is specifically with the Moon's potential inhabitants rather than the Moon as a celestial body in a more general sense. This clarifies the focus implied by the book's themes.","The source mentions the imaginary face on the Moon is composed based on 'des tâches qu'elle nous montre' (the spots it shows us). The target text, after translating 'tâches' as 'Spots, Lights and Shadows', adds the clause 'which are the Surface of the Moon'. This addition explicitly clarifies the physical nature of these spots as being the Moon's actual surface, a fact implied but not stated by Fontenelle.","The source concisely states that the Moon rotates on its axis in the same time it orbits the Earth ('en un mois'), implying why the same face is always seen. The target text significantly expands on this by adding a detailed mechanical explanation of how this synchronous rotation results in the same face being presented to Earth, including effects on the 'imaginary Face' and the Moon's orientation. This spells out the unstated mechanism and consequences.","The source refers to the Moon's 'tremblement' (libration) and ambiguously suggests 'de s'imaginer' (to imagine) a pendulum motion for the Earth. The target text expands on 'tremblement' by describing its visual effect ('which does sometimes hide a little of her imaginary Face, and at other times shews a little of her opposite Side') and explicitly attributes the misinterpretation of this libration as Earth's motion ('this shaking') to 'the Inhabitants of the Moon'.","The source briefly states that lunar observers 'ne nous voyent pas décrire un Cercle autour d'eux' (do not see us [Earth] describe a circle around them). The target text greatly expands this by detailing what lunar observers *do* see (other planets moving, Earth stationary: 'The Inhabitants of the Moon see all the other Planets rise and set... but they see our Earth always hanging in the same Point') and adds a philosophical reflection on Earth's planetary status from this perspective. This spells out the implied visual and astronomical context more fully.","The source describes one half of a celestial body 'qui a le jour' (which has day) and the other 'qui est dans la nuit' (which is in night). The target renders this as 'or half Day, and the other half is still in the Darkness of Night.' The phrase 'or half Day' clarifies that 'day' applies to a specific half of the globe, while 'Darkness of' makes the implied quality of darkness associated with 'nuit' explicit and more descriptive.","The source states that a ball has 'moins de force & de vitesse après' (less force and speed after) hitting a wall. The target makes the implied comparison explicit by adding the clause 'than it had before it touch'd the Wall,', fully spelling out the state to which the 'after' state is being compared.","The source describes reflected light arriving at the Moon as becoming 'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée' (a whitish light when it has arrived there). The target text, in conveying this, inserts the phrase 'to the Inhabitants of the Moon,' explicitly naming the observers of this light. This detail is implied by the book's theme of lunar inhabitants but not stated in Fontenelle's specific sentence here.","The source states 'nous sommes en Décours pour elles' (we [Earth] are waning for them [the observers on the Moon]). The target translates this as 'the Earth is in the Wain, as to its Inhabitants.' Assuming 'its Inhabitants' is intended to refer to the Moon's inhabitants (clarifying 'elles'), this explicitly names the group for whom the Earth is waning, changing the pronoun to a specific noun group."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P027: Il n'en faut pas davantage, dit brusquement la Marquise, je saurai tout le reste quand il me plaira, je n'ai qu'à y penser un moment, &amp; qu'à promener la Lune sur son Cercle d'un mois.

The English \"the exact Reverse of ours\" makes the *precision and completeness* of this opposition explicit by adding \"exact,\" clarifying an implied aspect of the reversal.","The French implies the Marquise's concern about appearing to need simple explanations or being seen as unintelligent. The English translation makes the underlying reason for this concern explicit: \"with the want of so much Sence.\" This spells out the implicit fear of being perceived as lacking intelligence, which was only suggested by the French.","The French \"comment vont-elles?\" (literally \"how do they go?\") is an informal inquiry about the mechanism of eclipses. The English \"What is the Cause of them?\" translates this into a more direct and formal question that explicitly seeks the underlying \"Cause,\" making the implied scientific quest for an explanation of cause more pointed and less conversational.","The French \"par la moitié obscure de la Lune\" (by the obscure half of the Moon) could ambiguously refer to the hemisphere itself as the perceiving agent. The English translation \"by the Inhabitants of the obscure half of the Moon\" explicitly clarifies that the act of seeing is performed by (implied) inhabitants, resolving a potential ambiguity by making the agent explicit.","In the context of \"une Eclipse de Terre pour la Lune\" (an Eclipse of Earth for the Moon), the French phrase \"pour la Lune\" (for the Moon) could mean the Moon as a celestial body. The English translation \"to those in the Moon\" makes explicit that the eclipse is experienced from the perspective of the Moon's (implied) inhabitants, clarifying for whom the event is an \"Eclipse of the Earth.\"","The French \"sur le Corps de la Lune\" (on the body of the Moon) is a general term.

The translator makes this implied aspect of 'difficulty' explicit by adding \"or Difficulty,\" thereby spelling out a potential reason for the mystery.","The French \"un certain Demon\" (a certain Demon) refers to a singular, specific type of malevolent entity. The translation \"certain Demons, or Spirits\" pluralizes \"Demon\" and adds \"or Spirits,\" thereby expanding the category of beings and making explicit an alternative or synonymous term for \"Demon\" (Spirits) which clarifies the nature of the perceived threat for the English reader.","The French \"une certaine écume malfaisante\" (a certain harmful/malevolent scum/foam) is made more specific in the translation \"a certain poisonous Scum or Dew\". \"Malfaisante\" (harmful) is clarified by \"poisonous,\" and \"écume\" (scum/foam) is expanded with the alternative \"or Dew,\" making explicit a potential form or interpretation of the harmful substance.","The French \"sur les Herbes\" (on the herbs) is translated as \"upon the Herbs and Grass.\" The addition of \"and Grass\" explicitly expands the category of vegetation mentioned, clarifying that both herbs and grass are understood to be affected, whereas \"Herbes\" alone could be taken more narrowly or generally.","The French litotic expression \"Dieu sait ce qu'on ne faisoit pas\" (God knows what one didn't do), implying great efforts were made, is translated as \"God knows what pains they are at.\" The word \"pains\" makes explicit the nature of these significant efforts (i.e., trouble, exertion) undertaken for reconciliation, which was more generally implied by the French idiom.","The French \"les Philosophes\" (the Philosophers), in the 17th-century context, often referred broadly to scholars or natural philosophers. The translation \"the learned Men\" makes this wider, contemporary meaning explicit, clarifying that the term is not restricted to philosophers in a narrower, modern sense.","The French \"pour nous rassurer\" (to reassure us) implies reassuring about the perceived threat or fear associated with the eclipse. The translation \"to assure us, there was no danger\" makes the specific object of this reassurance – the absence of danger – explicit.","The French \"un Arrêt du Genre humain\" (a decree/law of Mankind) implies a collective decision or an edict with broad authority. The translation \"a Law made by universal Consent\" makes the presumed mechanism or the collective, agreed-upon nature of such a 'law of Mankind' explicit by adding \"made by universal Consent.\"","The French \"conserve la memoire\" (preserve the memory) implies duration. The English translation fragment \"preserv'd to Posterity\" (from \"memory ... shou'd be preserv'd to Posterity\") not only translates the core idea but makes explicit the intended long-term audience or timeframe by adding \"to Posterity,\" which was implicit in the French desire to preserve memory.","The French \"hommes\" (men/people), in the context of discussing Earth's inhabitants, is translated as \"Inhabitants in our Globe.\" The addition of \"in our Globe\" makes the location of these people (Earth) explicit, which was contextually implied but not directly stated in the French word \"hommes\" itself.","The French phrase \"qui adorent aussi la Terre\" (who also adore the Earth), through the word \"aussi\" (also/too), implicitly attributes to the Moon dwellers the same foolishness (\"assez fous\") previously ascribed to Earthlings who adore the Moon. The translation \"foolish enough to adore our Earth\" makes this implied characteristic of being \"foolish enough\" explicit in the description of the Moon inhabitants.","The French \"donner des crises à ses Malades\" (literally, to give crises/fits to its sick people) refers to the Moon's supposed ill effects. The translation \"to give a Judgment on their Distempers\" reinterprets \"crises\" not just as medical episodes but as phenomena allowing for astrological/medical \"Judgment\" (prognostication/diagnosis) regarding \"Distempers\" (illnesses). This significantly rewrites the original by making explicit a specific, more elaborate interpretation of Earth's (in this context, as a parallel to the Moon's) influence.","The French phrase \"est quelque chose de bien propre à\" (is something quite suited to/apt to) implies an inherent quality or tendency of ignorance to be widespread. The translation fragment \"is naturally\" (from \"Ignorance is naturally a very general Talent\") makes this inherent or intrinsic nature explicit by adding the adverb \"naturally.\""]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P032: Et quelles sont ces Nouvelles seures? interrompit-elle.

This formality was implied by the social context and the characters' relationship in the original French but is spelled out in the translation.","The French `Lunettes de longue veuë` (literally \"long-view glasses\") is translated as `long Telescopes`. The translator makes the specific nature of the instrument explicit by using the common English term \"Telescopes,\" clarifying that these are astronomical instruments. This was implied by the context of astronomical observation but is made more direct.","The French `des Terres` (lands/earths) is translated as `vast Countries`. The translator specifies `Terres` as `Countries` (distinct regions or territories, rather than just undifferentiated land) and further makes implicit information about their scale explicit by adding the adjective \"vast.\" This emphasizes the large size and organized nature of these lunar features, ideas implied by the context of discovery but not explicitly stated for `des Terres` in the French.","The French `des Abîmes très profonds` (very deep abysses/chasms) is translated as `deep Valleys`. The translator makes the nature of these geological features more explicit by rendering `Abîmes` (abysses) as `Valleys`. This specifies them as a more common and familiar type of terrestrial depression, rather than the more general or potentially more dramatic `abysses`, thereby making the lunar landscape more concretely relatable by classifying the features explicitly."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P033: Vous me surprenez, reprit-elle.

The English translation \"remarkable Inequality we see in its Surface\" makes explicit *how* these inequalities are perceived (\"we see\") and *where* they are located (\"in its Surface\"), adding clarifying details about the observation process and location that were only implied to be part of the recognition of these inequalities in the source phrase.","The French \"des Terres,\" in the context of distinguishing physical lunar features from \"Mers\" (Seas), primarily refers to landmasses. The translation \"Countries\" explicitly introduces a socio-political or organized territorial connotation, suggesting divisions similar to those on Earth. This re-writing makes an idea (of the Moon having organized regions, potentially supporting the book's theme of habitable worlds) more explicit than the original term \"Terres\" alone conveys in this descriptive scientific context.","The French \"endroits plus brillants\" (brighter places) uses a comparative adjective. The English translation \"the brightest part of the Globe of the Moon\" changes this to a superlative (\"brightest\") and explicitly adds the phrase \"of the Globe of the Moon.\" This makes the description more emphatic and spatially specific than the original French, which implied the location but didn't state it so directly in this part of the sentence, thereby increasing the explicitness.","The French \"Savants\" (scholars, learned people), used here in the phrase \"noms de Savants\" (names of scholars), is a gender-neutral term in itself, though historically most scholars were male. The English translation uses \"learned Men\" as part of \"Names of learned Men,\" making the gender explicit. This addition specifies the gender, reflecting the socio-historical context but altering the neutrality of the source term by textually re-writing it.","The French \"un Savant\" (a learned person/scholar) is translated as \"a learned Man.\" Similar to the previous instance, this makes the gender explicit. While the historical context implies most \"savants\" were male, the French term itself is not exclusively masculine. The translation re-writes this by adding explicit gender information not present in the source word.","The French verb \"s'égareroit\" (would get lost) is translated by the expanded phrase \"be in danger of losing his Way.\" This expansion explicitly introduces the concept of \"danger,\" which was only implicitly associated with the act of getting lost in the source. This re-writing heightens the negative implication and expands a condensed expression."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P034: Mais, reprit- elle, je serois bien aise de savoir encore plus en détail comment est fait le dedans du pays. Il n'est pas possible, répliquay-je, que Messieurs de l'Observatoire vous en instruisent, il faut le demander à Astolphe, qui fut conduit dans la Lune par Saint Jean. Je vous parle d'une des plus agréables folies de l'Arioste, &amp; je seuir sûr que vous serez bien aise de la savoir. J'avoüe qu'il eut mieux fait de n'y pas mêler Saint Jean, dont le nom est si digne de respect; mais enfin c'est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">une licence Poëtique</span></span>, qui peut seulement passer pour un peu trop gaye. Tout le Poëme est dédié à un Cardinal, e&amp; un grand Pape l'a honoré d'une approbation éclatante que l'on voit au devant de quelques Editions. Voicy de quoy il s'agit. Roland, Neveu de Charlemagne, étoit devenu fou, parce que la belle Angelique luy avoit préferé Médor. Un jour Astolphe, brave Paladin, se trouva dans le Paradis Terrestre, qui étoit sur la cime d'une Montagne très haute, où son Hippogriffe l'avoit porté. Là il rencontre Saint Jean, qui luy dit que pour guerir la folie de Rolan, il étoit necessaire qu'ils fissent ensemble le Voyage de la Lune. Astolphe, qui ne demandoit qu'à voir du Pays, ne se fait point prier, &amp; aussi-tôt voilà un Chariot de feu qui enleve par les airs l'apôtre e&amp; le Paladin. Comme Astolphe n'étoit pas grand Philosophe, il fut fort surpris de voir la Lune beaucoup plus grande qu'elle ne luy avoit paru de dessus la Terre. Il fut bien plus surpris encore de voir d'autres fleuves, d'autres Lacs, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">d'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts</span></span>, &amp; ce qui m'aurait bien surpris aussi, des Nymphes qui chassoient dans ces Forêts. Mais ce qu'il vit de plus rare dans la Lune, c'étoit un Vallon où se trouvoit tout ce qui se perdoit sur la Terre, de quelque espèce qu'il fût, &amp; les Couronnes, &amp; les Richesses, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">la Renommée</span></span>, &amp; une infinité d'Esperances, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">le temps qu'on donne au Jeu</span></span>, &amp; les Aumônes qu'on fait faire aprés sa mort, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes</span></span>, &amp; les Soûpirs des Amans. </p><p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune. N'y eût-il que vous, Madame, repris-je en badinant, vous y avez fait aller tous ceux qu'on vous a adressez, &amp; c'est dequoy faire dans la Lune un amas considerable. Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin. C'est que les Papes ont prétendu être Maîtres de Rome &amp; de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, &amp; la verité est qu'on ne sauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë. Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie. Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres bien conservé. En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus. Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, &amp; qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, &amp; sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune. Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">à quelque temps delà</span></span>. Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre</span></span>? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">la chose</span></span> continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut. En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne. Mais pour achever de m'ôter le mien, dites-moy, &amp; dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune; car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une manière assez positive.

S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, &amp; que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; &amp; si d'ailleurs nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eût ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures qu'on appelle le Genre humain? Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eût des passions si folles, &amp; des reflexions si sages; une durée si courte, &amp; des veües si longues, tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, &amp; tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">tant d'inclination à la Servitude</span></span>; une si forte envie d'être heureux, &amp; une si grande incapacité de l'être? Il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela. Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mêmes, &amp; nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">On a eté réduit à dire que les Dieux etoient plein de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes, &amp; que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sang froid, ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire.</span></span> Nous voila donc bien en seureté du côté des Gens de la Lune, dit la Marquise, ils ne nous devineront pas; mais je voudrais que nous les pussions deviner, car en verité cela inquiete, de savoir qu'ils sont là-haut, dans cette Lune que nous voyons, &amp; de ne pouvoir pas se figurer comment ils sont faits. Et pourquoi, rêpondis-je, n'avez-vous point d'inquietude sur les Habitans de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">cette grande Terre Australe qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe</span></span>? Nous sommes portés eux &amp; nous sur un même Vaisseau dont ils occupent la Proüe, &amp; nous la Pouppe. Vous voyez que de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, &amp; qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font, &amp; vous voudriez savoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux? </p><p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien</span></span>. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste.</span></span> D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas?</span></span> Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée? En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">de leur donner du mouvement</span></span>, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">il se perfectionnera</span></span>, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">Elle entre si naturellement dans</span></span> qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. Ah! vous me soulagez, répliqua la Marquise, votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of.</p> <p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse.</p> <p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</p> <p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</p> <p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">under and near the South-Pole</span></span>, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country.

Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">seven Years after</span></span>: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse. </p><p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">the Senses your Charms have made me lose</span></span>, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">your Cruelties</span></span> must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips. </p><p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine. </p><p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures:</span></span> Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">the new discovered World of America, &amp;c.</span></span> and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">I do not think we should find Men and Women there</span></span>. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery</span></span>; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work.</span></span> We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us</span></span>? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">beyond which they saw nothing</span></span>. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men.</span></span> I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?)</span></span> It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air</span></span>, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">time must bring it to Maturity</span></span>, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">it penetrates so naturally into the Soul</span></span>, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","explanations":["The translator adds 'and Liberty of Conscience' to 'a Poetical Licence', explicitly linking the literary concept of poetic freedom to the highly topical socio-political issue of religious tolerance ('Liberty of Conscience') prevalent in England at the time of translation.","The French 'd'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts' (other Towns, other Forests) is expanded to 'Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests'. The translator adds 'Mountains, Plains, Groves', making the description of the lunar landscape more detailed by explicitly listing additional geographical features.","The French 'la Renommée' (renown, fame) is translated as 'Renown, and Grandure'. The addition of 'and Grandure' expands the original concept, explicitly adding a related quality often associated with renown.","The French 'le temps qu'on donne au Jeu' (the time one gives to games/play) is significantly expanded to 'time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play'. The translator adds the specific example of 'time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men', introducing a contemporary satirical target not explicit in the original.","The French 'les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes' (the Verses one presents to Princes) is translated as 'The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes'. The addition of 'and Dedications' makes explicit a common accompaniment to verses presented to patrons, which was only implied.","The French 'à quelque temps delà' (some time later) is rendered as 'seven Years after'.

The translator makes explicit a specific interpretation of the polysemous 'Esprit' by choosing 'Senses', clarifying that it refers to losing one's rational faculties in love.","The French 'la chose' (the thing), referring to the cause of the lover's continued loss of spirit, is translated as 'your Cruelties'. This explicitation specifies the implied antecedent of 'la chose' within the context of a lover's complaint to his mistress.","The French 'Je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune.' (I do not believe at all that there are Men in the Moon.) is translated as 'I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures:'. The addition 'but some other odd sort of Creatures' makes explicit the immediate implication of there not being 'Men', anticipating the philosopher's subsequent reasoning.","The French 'certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes' (certain newly discovered lands) is translated as 'the new discovered World of America, &c.'.

Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">icy</span></span> au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">Habitans</span></span> de la Lune; j'ay surmonté <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">la peine que j'y avois</span></span>, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">allons au fait</span></span>. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Qui verroit la Terre de loin</span></span>, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">un endroit obscur</span></span>, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">dès qu'il serait découvert</span></span>. On verroit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">des taches</span></span> qui changeroient de place, ou <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">s'assembleroient diversement</span></span>, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">ses taches</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">sont fixes</span></span>, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">&amp; voilà le malheur</span></span>. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">de dessus la Lune</span></span>. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">par la chaleur</span></span>. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">de grandes cavitez</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">De la distance où nous sommes</span></span>, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune; conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">une inclination</span></span> que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">une froideur</span></span> qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"20\">de gros nüages</span></span> qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"21\">jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes</span></span>. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"22\">se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées</span></span> pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"23\">car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte</span></span>, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"24\">toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres</span></span>, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"25\">par l'action du Soleil sur elles</span></span>; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"26\">ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors</span></span>.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"27\">autour d'elle en nuages</span></span>, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable.

We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, as the Earth is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change; there lies the difficulty: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are at from the Moon. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination and a Kindness for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling. It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon (for certainly it emits Vapours;) and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain: And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence; so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, with a little Knowledge; but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but I told her, 'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them.

The translator makes explicit the *type* of learned conversation ('Philosophical') and its *purpose/nature* ('Entertainment'), aligning with the work's popularizing and engaging style.","The French 'icy' (here) is translated as 'upon our Earth'. The translator makes the implicit location (Earth, understood from context) explicit, removing any potential ambiguity for the reader.","The French 'la peine que j'y avois' (the difficulty/trouble I had with it) is significantly expanded to 'all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion'. This explicitation details the *nature* of the 'peine' (Difficulties), its *source* (her Reason), and its *object* (against that Opinion).","The French 'allons au fait' (let's get to the point/facts) is rendered as 'let us come to the subject matter in debate'. The addition 'in debate' makes explicit the implicit understanding that 'le fait' refers to a contentious topic under discussion.","The French 'Qui verroit la Terre de loin' (Whoever would see the Earth from afar) is translated as 'And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance'. This explicates the hypothetical nature by adding 'if it were possible for any one' and expands the action by adding 'and consider'.","The French 'un endroit obscur' (an obscure place/spot) is translated as 'a very obscure part of the Globe'. The addition 'part of the Globe' makes explicit that 'endroit' refers to a region of the Earth in the context of planetary observation.","The French 'dès qu'il serait découvert' (as soon as it [the country] would be uncovered) is translated as 'as soon as these Clouds dis-appear'. This makes explicit that the 'uncovering' is due to the disappearance of 'these Clouds', which was implied.","The French 'des taches' (spots/patches) observed on Earth is translated as 'these obscure places'. This makes an explicit connection to the previously mentioned 'endroit obscur' (obscure place), clarifying that the 'taches' are these same areas.","The French 's'assembleroient diversement' (would gather in various ways) is translated as 'meeting together in different Figures'. The phrase 'in different Figures' makes explicit a specific visual manner of how the spots might assemble, which was only generally implied by 'diversement'.","The French 'ses taches' (its spots/patches), referring to features on the Moon, is translated as 'the Obscurities, or dark places'. This explicitation clarifies the visual nature of these lunar 'taches' as perceived by an observer, using more descriptive terminology.","The French 'sont fixes' (are fixed), describing the unchanging nature of lunar features, is significantly elaborated to 'are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change'. This expansion makes the concept of permanence and lack of change much more emphatic and detailed than the concise French original.","The French '& voilà le malheur' (and there's the misfortune/bad luck) is translated as 'there lies the difficulty:'. The translator interprets 'malheur' in the context of the scientific argument as a 'difficulty' for the hypothesis of lunar inhabitants, making this implication explicit.","The French 'de dessus la Lune' (from upon the Moon) is translated as 'from the Globe of the Moon'. The addition of 'Globe of' makes explicit the planetary, spherical nature of the Moon, a key concept in the discussion.","The French 'par la chaleur' (by the heat) is translated as 'by the heat of the Sun'. This makes explicit the source of the heat, which is the Sun, a fact clearly implied in the astronomical context but not stated.","The French pronoun 'elles' (they), referring to 'évaporations' (evaporations) mentioned earlier, is translated as 'which Vapours'. This makes the referent of the pronoun explicit for clarity.","The French 'Habitans' (inhabitants) is translated as 'living Creatures'. This makes explicit the biological nature of the 'Habitans', emphasizing that they are life forms.","The French 'de grandes cavitez' (large cavities) is expanded to 'deep Caverns, and vast Cavities'. This explicitation uses more descriptive and evocative terms ('deep', 'vast', 'Caverns') to paint a clearer and more detailed picture of the lunar features.","The French 'De la distance où nous sommes' (From the distance where we are) is translated as 'at the great distance we are at from the Moon'. The addition 'from the Moon' makes explicit the other reference point of the distance (Earth to Moon), which was implied.","The French 'une inclination' (an inclination/liking) is translated as 'an Inclination and a Kindness'. The addition of 'and a Kindness' makes explicit the benevolent nature of the Marquise's feeling for the lunar inhabitants.","The French 'une froideur' (a coldness) is translated as 'cold Airs'. This makes explicit the medium or manifestation of the coldness, specifying it as being related to the air.","The French 'de gros nüages' (large/big clouds) is translated as 'thick and black Clouds'. The addition of 'black' makes explicit a common characteristic of dense clouds, particularly rain clouds, adding visual detail not present in 'gros'.","The French 'jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes' (until they fall back as rains) is translated as 'till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain'. The addition 'upon the Earth' makes explicit the destination of the rainfall, which was implied by 'retombet' (fall back).","The French 'se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées' (sometimes keep themselves quite dispersed) is translated as 'are extended, and kept from joining together'. This makes explicit the mechanism or state of being dispersed, by describing them as 'extended' and 'kept from joining together'.","The French 'car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte' (for, after all, some must come out of it [the Moon]) is translated as 'for certainly it emits Vapours'. The pronoun 'en' (of it/some) is made explicit as 'Vapours', clarifying what is expected to be emitted from the Moon.","The French 'toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres' (all equally at rest next to each other), describing the parts of the Moon, is translated as 'and so equal a temper, one with the other'. 'En repos' (at rest) is interpreted and explicitated as an 'equal temper', referring to a state of internal equilibrium or stable constitution.","The French 'par l'action du Soleil sur elles' (by the action of the Sun on them [the Moon's parts]) is translated as 'by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em'. The general term 'l'action' is made explicit by specifying the types of action ('attracting and moving') and adding 'Influence', reflecting contemporary scientific concepts.","The French 'ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors' (or by that which it [a body] receives from outside) is translated as 'or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another'. The pronoun 'celuy' (that which) is made explicit as 'some exterior Impulse', giving a more specific, mechanical nature to the external cause.","The French phrase 'ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages' (do not gather around it [the Moon] into clouds) is rendered as 'are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds'. The addition 'as a rounded Surface' makes explicit an assumed characteristic of cloud formation (gathering into a voluminous, rounded form) that is being negated.","The French 'voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent' (behold its Inhabitants are reborn) is translated as 'which furnish it with Inhabitants'. This changes the passive construction of inhabitants being reborn to an active one where the previously discussed motion or causes 'furnish it [the Moon] with Inhabitants', making the causal link more direct and explicit.","The French 'le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance' (the necessary basis/foundation for their subsistence) is translated as 'a sufficient Food for their Subsistence'. This makes explicit that a key component of the 'necessary basis' is 'Food'.","The French 'des fruits, des bleds, des eaux à la maniere de la Lune' (fruits, grains, waters in the Moon's way/style) is translated as 'Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon'. The phrase 'à la manière de la Lune' is explicitated as 'agreeable to the nature of the Moon', clarifying that it means conformity to the Moon's specific conditions.","The French 'que tout est bien' (that all is well), spoken by the Marquise about the Moon, is translated as 'that all is very well there'. The addition of 'there' makes the location (the Moon) explicit, which was understood from context.","The French 'il faut s'en consoler' (one must console oneself for it) is translated as 'but we must have patience'. This explicitation suggests 'patience' as a specific way to achieve the consolation implied in the French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empêcher la <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">communication</span></span> des deux Planetes.

The English addition of 'and Commerce' makes explicit that this interaction could also encompass other forms of exchange or dealings (commerce in its older sense of 'intercourse' or 'dealings') between the planets, broadening the scope implied by the single French word.","The French 'si on ne volera pas fort bien quelque jour' (if one will not fly very well someday) is a relatively direct expression of a future possibility. The English translation 'but we might come to perfection in that Art' explicitly introduces the concept of flying as an 'Art' and elaborates 'fly very well' into 'come to perfection,' making the potential mastery of flying more explicit and perhaps more formal.","The French 'qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup d'apparence.' (that there is not much likelihood/appearance) uses an impersonal construction ('il'). The English translation 'of what I say,' makes the subject of this likelihood explicit, directly connecting it to the speaker's immediately preceding assertion about the future of flying.","The French uses pronouns 'l'une' (one) and 'l'autre' (the other), which implicitly refer to the Earth and the Moon based on the preceding context ('Le grand éloignement de la Lune à la Terre'). The English translation makes these referents explicit by naming 'the Earth' and 'the Moon,' replacing the implicit pronominal reference with explicit nouns.","Fontenelle uses 'l'air des Poissons' (the air of Fish) metaphorically to mean their living medium. The translator makes this metaphorical meaning more explicit by adding 'and Element,' clarifying that water is not just 'air-like' for fish but their fundamental life-sustaining environment or natural medium.","Similar to the previous instance, 'l'Air des Oiseaux' (the Air of Birds) refers to their living medium. The English translation adds 'and Element,' explicitly clarifying that the air for birds is their specific, natural life-sustaining environment or medium, rather than just 'air' in a general sense.","The French pronoun 'le nôtre' (ours) implicitly refers to 'our air' within the context of the ongoing discussion about different types of 'Airs' on planets. The English translation 'our Air' makes this specific referent explicit.","The French 'se noyeroit' (would drown) is used by Fontenelle to describe the hypothetical demise of a Moon inhabitant in Earth's atmosphere. The English translation adds 'and suffocated,' thereby making explicit the precise physiological mechanism (asphyxiation) of this metaphorical 'drowning' in an unsuitable atmosphere, which was only implied by the more general term 'drown.'"]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P043: Oh, que j'aurois d'envie, s'écria la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">qu'il arrivât quelque grand naufrage qui répandît icy bon nombre de ces Gens- là</span></span>, dont nous irions considérer à notre aise les figures extraordinaires!

Additionally, the deictic \"icy\" (here) is translated as \"upon our World,\" making explicit the location implied within the context of discussing multiple worlds.","The general French term \"bien malade\" (very ill/sick) is rendered as \"very weak and feeble.\" This explicates the *nature* of the illness by specifying physical symptoms (weakness and feebleness) implied by the context of ascending into unbreathable air.","The French text focuses on the outcome: \"ne peuvent faire... que des plongeons de très peu de durée\" (can only make very short dives). The English translation, \"have great difficulty to penetrate the grossness of the Air which we breath,\" makes explicit the *reason* for this outcome by detailing the challenge (difficulty, penetration) and the nature of the medium (\"grossness of the Air\"), which were implied by \"air épais\" (thick air) and the resulting short dives.","The French \"barrieres naturelles\" (natural barriers) implies barriers existing in nature. The English translation \"Nature has set many Bars and Fences\" makes explicit an agent (\"Nature\") that actively placed these barriers, a role only implied by the adjective \"naturelles.\" \"Bars and Fences\" also provides a more concrete image than \"barrieres.\"","The French impersonal pronoun \"on\" (one/they), which contextually refers to observers on the Moon (as in \"qu'on y voye\" - that one/they see there), is translated as \"the Inhabitants of the Moon.\" This makes the previously implicit subject explicit.","The French \"Lunette naturelle\" (natural lens/spyglass) uses a general term for an optical device. The English \"natural Perspective-Glass\" employs a more specific contemporary term for an instrument like a telescope or spyglass, thus making explicit the particular type of \"lens\" implied by the context of viewing celestial objects.","The French pronoun \"il\" in \"que de luy-même il est bleu\" (that by itself it is blue) refers anaphorically to \"notre Air\" (our Air) mentioned in the preceding sentence. The English translation makes this referent explicit by restating \"the Air\" (\"that the Air of it self is blew\").","The French pronoun \"il\" in \"il paraît bleu\" (it appears blue) refers to \"Le Ciel\" (The Heavens/Sky). The English translation makes this referent explicit by restating \"the Heavens.\" Furthermore, \"of that Colour\" explicitly links the appearance to the \"blew\" color of the air mentioned immediately prior, spelling out the connection more directly than simply repeating \"blue.\"","The French phrase \"& prendre autant de celle qui leur est naturelle\" (and take as much of that [color] which is natural to them) is potentially ambiguous, as \"prendre\" can mean to take/acquire. The English translation \"and at the same time lose as much of their own natural Colour\" resolves this by explicitly stating that the sun's and stars' rays *lose* their natural color, making explicit a consequence (loss of own color due to acquiring air's color) that was implied.","The English translation introduces \"so\" (\"so all our Air...\"), explicitly marking a logical conclusion from the preceding analogy about the flambeau in fog; this causal link is less directly stated by the French \"et notre Air n'est non plus qu'un gros broüillard...\" (and our Air is also nothing but a thick fog...). Additionally, \"vraye couleur\" (true color) is rendered \"true natural Colour,\" where \"natural\" makes explicit the inherent, original quality of the celestial bodies' color implied by \"vraye.\"","The English \"for\" (\"for nothing but the pure heavenly Substance...\") explicitly frames the sentence as providing a reason for the preceding argument (why air alters colors), a causal relationship not overtly marked by a conjunction in the French. Moreover, \"dans toute leur pureté, & telles qu'elles sont\" (in all their purity, and such as they are) is translated as \"in their Purity and Perfection,\" where \"Perfection\" makes explicit the ideal, flawless state of colors implied by \"telles qu'elles sont\" in this context.","The French \"qui cause une autre alteration aux couleurs des Corps celestes\" (which causes another alteration to the colors of Celestial Bodies) is translated as \"changing, in appearance, the Colours of the Celestial Bodies.\" The addition of \"in appearance\" explicitly clarifies that the \"alteration\" of colors is a perceptual or visual phenomenon, an aspect implied by the discussion of visual media but not overtly stated by the French word \"alteration\" alone.","Firstly, the French \"à l'égard des Gens de la Lune\" (regarding the People of the Moon) is translated with the conditional \"if there be Inhabitants in the Moon,\" making their hypothetical status more explicit. Secondly, where the French states \"cette Lunette ... est changée\" (this lens ... is changed), the English \"they see all things chang'd\" explicitly states the *consequence* of this changed lens on lunar perception.

'Sejour' can imply either a temporary stay or a more permanent residence. 'Place of Habitation' explicitly clarifies the meaning as a fixed dwelling place, adding information about the nature of the 'sejour' that was more implicit in the original.","The French 'du bleu' (of blue / the blue) is general. The English translation 'a deep Blue' adds the qualifier 'deep,' specifying the intensity or shade of the color, which is clarifying information not explicitly present in the source text.","The French 'que vous assortiriez un habit, ou un meuble' (that you would match/assort a garment, or a piece of furniture) is expanded. The translator makes explicit the specific actions ('fitting of,' 'chusing a Garniture for') and clarifies the context/type of items ('Furniture for a Room,' 'a Suit of Cloths'), rewriting a concise phrase into a more descriptive one by adding clarifying details.","The French 'à chaque point de veüe diferent' (at each different point of view) is rendered as 'according to the different Situation and Position of the Beholders.' This translation explicitly spells out that the 'point of view' is determined by the observers' physical circumstances ('Situation and Position'), adding clarifying information about the factors behind the varying perspectives.","The French 'elle n'a changé que les Lunettes' (she has only changed the glasses/lenses) is translated as 'and has only chang'd the Perspective-glasses, through which they are seen.' 'Perspective-glasses' is a more specific term for optical devices of the era than the general 'Lunettes.' Furthermore, the added clause 'through which they are seen' explicitly states the function of these 'Perspective-glasses' in the act of perception, a detail that was implied but not spelled out in the source.","The French 'pour chaque point de veûe' (for each point of view), in the context of changing objects, is translated as 'as to the several Points from whence they may be seen.' This expansion explicitly defines 'point de veûe' in a spatial or observational sense, as physical locations or perspectives from which objects are viewed, adding clarifying information about the nature of these viewpoints.","The French 'un Ciel rouge' (a red Sky/Heaven) is translated as 'a Heaven of Scarlet.' While 'Ciel' can be 'Heaven,' 'rouge' (red) is rendered as 'Scarlet,' which is a specific, vivid shade of red. This adds clarifying information by specifying the type of red, a detail not explicit in the more general 'rouge.'","The French 'Air rouge' (red Air), in the phrase 'avec un Air rouge, elle donne un Ciel rouge aux Habitans de la Lune,' appears after 'Ciel rouge' (red Sky). The target translates the Moon's sky as 'a Heaven of Scarlet' and then its air as 'an Air of the same Colour.' The phrase 'of the same Colour' explicitly links the air's color to the previously specified 'Scarlet' of the sky, spelling out a relationship that was implied by the repetition of 'rouge' in the source.","The French 'certaines Lunettes' (certain glasses/lenses) is translated and expanded to 'a Perspective-glass, or Tube.' The addition of 'or Tube' provides a more specific example or alternative for 'Lunettes' (rendered as 'Perspective-glass'), likely alluding to optical instruments like telescopes. This expands the original phrase by adding clarifying information about the potential nature of these metaphorical 'Lunettes'.","The French proper name 'Alexandre' is translated as 'Alexander the Great.' The addition of the common epithet 'the Great' explicitly identifies the specific historical figure, adding clarifying information that ensures immediate recognition for the reader.","The French 'le sejour d'Astrée' (the stay/sojourn/abode of Astraea) is translated as 'the Dwelling-place of Astraea.' The term 'Dwelling-place' is more specific than 'sejour,' explicitly indicating a fixed place of residence rather than a more general or temporary stay, thus adding clarifying information about the nature of Astraea's presence."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, répliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mêmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

The English translation adds a preceding clarification: 'for the Beams of the Sun, at these two times, being oblique and faint, have not strength to penetrate the grosness and thickness of the Air,'. This explicitly introduces the properties of the sunbeams (being 'oblique and faint' and lacking 'strength to penetrate') as a crucial reason for their interception by the air (whose 'grosness' Fontenelle mentioned), adding a layer of scientific detail not as directly stated in the source.","The French 'par dessus ce qui nous est dû.' (over and above what is due to us.) implies something extra or unmerited. The English translation 'by the by, or, as it were, by chance,' makes this more explicit by specifying the *manner* in which this extra light is received – incidentally or accidentally – which is an interpretative clarification of the French.","The French 'l'arrivée du Soleil,' (the arrival of the Sun,) is rendered in English as 'the glorious Appearance of the Sun at Noon;'. The translator makes this more explicit by adding the descriptive phrase 'glorious Appearance' and specifying the timing 'at Noon', details that embellish and concretize the simpler French expression.","The French 'un milieu' (a middle/medium) is translated and expanded to 'those Mediums, or Interstices,'. By adding 'or Interstices,' the translator provides a more specific, somewhat technical synonym, making the nature of the transitional phase between day and night more explicit and scientifically precise.","The French 'l'Arc-en-ciel se forme dans les nuages d'ou tombent les pluyes,' (the rainbow forms in the clouds from which rain falls,) is significantly expanded in the English translation to 'the Rain-bow is form'd upon Exhalations and Vapours, condens'd into black Clouds, which pour down Rain upon us, by divers Reflections and Refections of the Sun-beams upon these Clouds:'. The translator adds details about the composition of clouds ('Exhalations and Vapours, condens'd into black Clouds') and, crucially, the optical mechanism ('by divers Reflections and Refections of the Sun-beams upon these Clouds'), making the scientific explanation of rainbow formation much more explicit and detailed than in the source text.","The French 'celles qui le sont le moins.' (those things/ones that are the least [beautiful/agreeable], referring to the causes of rainbows like clouds and rain) is translated as 'the ugliest and most dis- agreeable Causes in Nature:'. The translator makes the referent 'celles' explicit as 'Causes in Nature' and intensifies 'le sont le moins' (are the least so) to the more descriptive and emphatic 'the ugliest and most disagreeable,' thus making the implied contrast and referent more explicit.","The French 'les Belles de ce Pays-là?' (the beautiful women of that country?) is rephrased in the target text as 'the Lovers in the Moon compare their Mistresses,'. The translator makes the implicit literary context of courtly or poetic comparisons explicit by introducing 'Lovers' and specifying that 'les Belles' are 'Mistresses' being compared. This spells out the social dynamic and the nature of the 'source de comparaisons perduë' (lost source of comparisons) more directly."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P048: Je n'aurois pas grand regret à ces comparaisons là, dit la Marquise, &amp; je trouve qu'on est assez bien recompense dans la Lune, de n'avoir <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">ny Aurore ny Arc-en- ciel</span></span>, car on ne doit avoir par la même raison ny Foudres ny Tonnerres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">puisque ce sont aussi des choses qui se forment dans les nüages.</span></span> On a de beaux jours toûjours serains pendant lesquels on ne perd point le Soleil de venë.

Peut-être aussi est-ce à cause de cela que la Nature a creusé dans la Lune des especes de Puits, qui sont assez grands pour être apperçus par nos Lunettes; car ce ne sont point des Vallées qui soient entre des Montagnes, ce sont des creux que l'on voit au milieu de certains lieux plats. Que sait-on si les Habitans de la Lune, incommodez par l'ardeur perpetuelle du Soleil, ne se refugient point dans ces grands Puits? Ils n'habitent peut-être point ailleurs, c'est là qu'ils bâtissent leurs Villes. Nous voyons icy que la Rome soûterraine êtoit presque aussi grande que la Rome qui est sur Terre.

They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another. You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other? Seriously, said I, Madam, 'twould be a great Pleasure and Satisfaction to see several different Worlds; and I am often glad, to make these Journeys in Imagination; what joy then it wou'd be to do it in reality; that wou'd be far better than to travel from hence to Iapan, crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again. Well, said she, what hinders, but we shou'd make a Journey through the Planets as well as we can? Let us by imagination place our selves in several Positions, and situations, fit for considering the Universe. Have we no more to see in the Moon? No, said I, at least, I have shown you all I know. Going out of the Moon towards the Sun, the first Planet you meet with is Venus; and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis. Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, as the Moon does round the Earth; and by the means of Telescopes, we discover that Venus waxes and wanes, being sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened according to her different Positions in respect to the Earth.</p> <p>P037: By all appearance the Moon is inhabited, why shou'd not Venus be so, as well as she? Ay, but interrupted the Marquiese by your why nots, you will people all the Planets. Do not doubt of it, Madam, answer'd I; why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all? We see that all the Planets are of the same Nature, that they are all Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun; which they send one to another by Reflection, and that they have all the same kind of motion; thus far equal, and after all this must we conceive that all these vast Bodies were made not to be inhabited? And that Nature has made only an exception in Favor of the Earth, he that will believe this, may, but for my part I cannot. I find you, said the Marquiese, very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited. It is true, Madam, in the minute wherein you have surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me, as to the Inhabitants of all the Planets, I wou'd not only have defended my opinion, but have proceeded, to have given you an exact description of all the several Inhabitants of the Planets. There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">The late invention of Glasses</span></span> call'd Microscopes, have discover'd thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there. And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates. If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">(as Pepper in Water,)</span></span> and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures. Several Bodies, which appear to be solid, are nothing else but Collections or little heaps of these imperceptible Animals; who find there as much room, as is requisite for them to move in. The leaf of a Tree, is a little World inhabited, by such invisible little Worms: To them this leaf seems of a vast Extent, they find Hills and Valleys upon it: And there is no more Communication between the living Creatures on the one side, and those on the other, than between us and the Antipodes. And I think there is more reason, to believe a Planet <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">(which is so vast a Body)</span></span> to be inhabited. There has been found in several sorts of very hard Stones, infinite multitudes of little Worms, lodg'd all over them in insensible varieties; and who are nourish'd upon the Substance of these Stones which they eat. Consider the vast Numbers of these little Animals, and how long a tract of Years they have liv'd upon a grain of Sand. And by this Argument, tho my Moon were nothing but a confus'd heap of Marble Rocks, I wou'd rather make it be devour'd and consum'd by its Inhabitants, than to place none at all in it.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P036: I do much regret that loss, said the Marquiese, for in my Opinion, the Inhabitants of the Moon are fully recompens'd for the want of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light,</span></span> since for the same Reason, they have neither Thunder nor Lightning, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">both which are produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations;</span></span> they enjoy bright serene Days, and never lose the Sun by Day, nor the Stars by Night. They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another.</span></span> You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World;</span></span> and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round,</span></span> and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction.</span></span> At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other? Seriously, said I, Madam, 'twould be a great Pleasure and Satisfaction to see several different Worlds; and I am often glad, to make these Journeys in Imagination; what joy then it wou'd be to do it in reality; that wou'd be far better than to travel from hence to Iapan, crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again.</span></span> Well, said she, what hinders, but we shou'd make a Journey through the Planets as well as we can? Let us by imagination place our selves in several Positions, and situations, fit for considering the Universe. Have we no more to see in the Moon? No, said I, at least, I have shown you all I know. Going out of the Moon towards the Sun, the first Planet you meet with is Venus; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, as the Moon does round the Earth;</span></span> and by the means of Telescopes, we discover that Venus waxes and wanes, being sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened according to her different Positions in respect to the Earth. </p><p>P037: By all appearance the Moon is inhabited, why shou'd not Venus be so, as well as she? Ay, but interrupted the Marquiese by your why nots, you will people all the Planets. Do not doubt of it, Madam, answer'd I; why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all? We see that all the Planets are of the same Nature, that they are all Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun; which they send one to another by Reflection, and that they have all the same kind of motion; thus far equal, and after all this must we conceive that all these vast Bodies were made not to be inhabited? And that Nature has made only an exception in Favor of the Earth, he that will believe this, may, but for my part I cannot. I find you, said the Marquiese, very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited. It is true, Madam, in the minute wherein you have surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me, as to the Inhabitants of all the Planets, I wou'd not only have defended my opinion, but have proceeded, to have given you an exact description of all the several Inhabitants of the Planets. There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd</span></span> thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there. And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,)</span></span> and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures.

The translation renders this as \"the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light\". The addition of \"twi-light\" expands the list, making explicit a related atmospheric light phenomenon (evening twilight) that was only implied by \"Aurore\" (morning twilight/dawn) in the context of general atmospheric effects missing on the Moon.","The French \"des choses qui se forment dans les nüages\" (things that form in clouds) is translated as \"produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations\". The addition of \"and Exhalations\" makes explicit a component of 17th-century meteorological theory, clarifying the supposed origin of such phenomena beyond just \"clouds\" by including vapours from the earth, a common scientific idea of the time not explicitly stated by Fontenelle.","The French \"pour la communication des Peuples\" (for the communication of peoples) is expanded to \"for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another\". The addition of \"and commerce\" explicitly includes trade as a form of interaction, which was only implied by the more general term \"communication\". The phrase \"of one People and Nation with another\" also spells out more clearly the reciprocal and broader nature of these interactions.","The French \"qui ont merité icy d'être bien-heureuses\" (who have merited here to be blessed/very happy) is translated as \"who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World\". The translator makes explicit that \"icy\" (here) refers to \"in this World\" and adds the phrase \"by their good Life\", clarifying the implicit condition or means by which happiness was merited.","The French \"l'Harmonie que les Corps Celestes font par leurs mouvements\" (the Harmony that Celestial Bodies make by their movements) is rendered as \"the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round\". The translator replaces the general \"Corps Celestes\" (Celestial Bodies) with \"the Spheres,\" making explicit the ancient cosmological concept of musical harmony produced by planetary spheres. Additionally, \"as they turn'd round\" specifies the nature of the \"mouvements\" (movements). This choice specifies Fontenelle's more neutral term by invoking a well-known, older concept.","The French \"la Lune se hâte le plus qu'elle peut de les tirer d'un endroit si fâcheux\" (the Moon hurries as much as it can to pull them from such a vexing place) is translated with an added explanation of how the Moon achieves this: \"the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction.\" This makes explicit the mechanism (the Moon exiting Earth's shadow after an eclipse and thus regaining its light) by which the souls are relieved, a detail implied by the context of the Moon being in shadow.","The French \"pour ne voir que des hommes\" (to see only men, or mankind/people) is translated as \"and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again\". The term \"Men and Women\" explicitly includes both genders where the French \"hommes\" is potentially ambiguous or more general. The addition of \"over and over again\" serves to intensify the idea of repetition, making an emotional nuance more explicit.","The French \"Sur Vénus je reprens le Saint-Denis.\" (On Venus I take up the Saint-Denis again.) is an internal allusion. The translation \"and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis.\" makes explicit that \"le Saint-Denis\" refers to a \"Simile\" used \"former[ly]\" in the dialogue and clarifies its full subject (\"Paris and St. Denis\"), information that the reader of the French text would have to recall or infer.","The French \"Vénus tourne sur elle-même, & autour du Soleil comme la Lune\" (Venus turns on herself, and around the Sun like the Moon) is translated as \"Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, as the Moon does round the Earth\". The phrase \"on her own Axis\" explicitly clarifies the astronomical meaning of \"tourne sur elle-même\" (turns on herself). Furthermore, the ambiguous comparison \"comme la Lune\" (like the Moon) is disambiguated and spelled out as \"as the Moon does round the Earth\", making the nature of the comparative celestial motion explicit.","The concise French metaphor \"dont il [le Ciron] est l'Eléphant\" (of which it [the mite] is the Elephant), referring to a mite in relation to even smaller, invisible creatures, is expanded to \"to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it.\" This translation explicitly spells out the analogical relationship of scale, clarifying the meaning of Fontenelle's highly condensed image.","The French \"On a vu avec des Lunettes\" (One has seen with glasses/lenses) is translated as \"The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd\". The translator specifies that \"Lunettes\" here refers to \"Microscopes\" and adds the contextual information \"The late invention of\", making explicit both the specific instrument and its novelty, aligning with the scientific advancements of Fontenelle's time.","The French \"Mêlez de certaines choses dans quelques-unes de ces Liqueurs\" (Mix certain things in some of these liquors) is rendered as \"If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,)\". The translator makes the vague \"certaines choses\" (certain things) more concrete by adding a specific, illustrative example \"(as Pepper in Water,)\", which was a common subject for early microscopic observation and thus clarifies the type of experiments being implied.","The French \"une grosse Planete\" (a big planet) is followed by an explicit explanatory clause in the English translation: \"a Planet (which is so vast a Body)\". This parenthetical addition spells out the implicit reason (its size or vastness) why such a planet, according to the speaker's logic, would more likely be inhabited.","The French \"un amas de rochers\" (a heap/mass of rocks) is translated as \"a confus'd heap of Marble Rocks\". The additions of \"confus'd\" (disordered) and \"Marble\" (a specific type of rock not mentioned in the source) make the description more vivid and specific, thereby explicitating by adding descriptive details not present in the original.","The French verb \"ronger\" (to gnaw, nibble, eat away) is translated using the doublet \"devour'd and consum'd\". This expansion serves to intensify the meaning, making the destructive action of the hypothetical lunar inhabitants more explicit and complete than the single French verb might suggest."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P051: Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë, dit la Marquise, mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planètes, &amp; embarrassée de la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux; car je voy bien que la Nature, selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela?

The English translation, after rendering the limitation, explicitly adds the injunction 'let us be satisfied with our Eyes,' which spells out a practical consequence or behavior implied by this limitation.","The French 'deux grandes Nations' (two great Nations), in context, implicitly refers to nations on Earth. The translator makes this implicit understanding explicit by adding 'of our Globe,' directly specifying the location of these nations.","The French 'chaque Famille' (each Family) can imply lineage or broader kinship groups. The translation expands this to 'every Family or Race of Men,' making explicit a potential interpretation of 'Famille' in a broader anthropological or societal sense common in the period, clarifying that it refers to human groupings.","The French 'en tant de manieres' (in so many ways) expresses a great, unspecified number of variations. The translation 'how many Millions of Times' makes this explicit by providing a specific (albeit figurative) large number, thereby intensifying and quantifying the implied vastness of Nature's variety.","The French 'Nous' (We), in the sentence 'Nous ne sommes dans l'Univers que comme une petite Famille,' clearly refers to humans on Earth within the context of a discussion about different planets. The translation 'We, the Inhabitants of the Earth,' makes this contextual understanding explicit by specifically identifying 'We.'","The French 'un autre air' (another air/look/manner) suggests a different appearance or quality. The translation 'another Air peculiar to themselves' makes explicit the idea that this different 'air' is unique and specific to that group, emphasizing their distinctiveness.","The French 'l'usage de la voix' (the use of the voice) refers to vocal communication. The translation 'the use of the Tongue and Voice' makes explicit the primary physical organ (the tongue) involved in producing speech, which is implied by 'la voix' in the context of speaking.","The French 'le raisonnement se forme entierement par l'experience' states that reason is 'entirely formed' by experience. The translation 'our Reason is form'd and made perfect by Experience' adds 'and made perfect,' which explicitates a potential outcome or a higher degree of development of reason through experience, going beyond mere formation.","The French implies the sixth sense would be beneficial by stating it 'nous aprendroit beaucoup de choses que nous ignorons' (would teach us many things we are ignorant of). The target translation of 'Ce sixiéme Sens est apparemment dans quelque autre Monde' as 'It may be the Inhabitants of some other Planet have this advantage' explicitly labels the possession of the sixth sense as a positive 'advantage,' a judgment that is implied in the French description of its function.","The French 'où elles [Nos Sciences] nous manquent tout à coup' means 'where they [our Sciences] suddenly fail us.' The translation 'where our Ingenuity is at a stand' shifts the focus from the sciences themselves failing to the human faculty of 'Ingenuity' reaching its limit. This makes explicit that it is a human capacity for discovery or understanding that is impeded.","The French 'Cette Planète-cy' (this planet here) clearly refers to Earth in the context of comparing it with other planets. The translation 'Our Globe' makes this identification explicit.","The French 'on s'ennuye' (one gets bored/people get bored) states a condition. The translation 'which must render their Lives very irksom' expands this by making explicit the causal consequence ('which must render') and the impact on their existence ('their Lives very irksom'), elaborating on the severity and scope of the boredom.","The French 'entre les hommes pour la distribution du bonheur' (among men for the distribution of happiness) is relatively general. The translation 'to us Mortals...by making some happy, others miserable' first specifies 'hommes' as 'Mortals,' adding an explicit characteristic, and then explicates 'distribution du bonheur' by illustrating it with the contrasting outcomes 'making some happy, others miserable,' spelling out a specific interpretation of how such a distribution manifests.","The French 'de les égaler en même temps que les compensations.' (of equalizing them at the same time as/through compensations) is concise. The English translation 'tho she has made some equal in some respects, by compensating the want of any one thing, with another of equal value.' significantly expands on this by specifying that equality is 'in some respects' and by detailing the mechanism of compensation, making the abstract notion concrete and explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux?

The translation \"of the other Planets\" makes this specific reference explicit, adding clarifying information.","The French phrase \"appris comment sont faits\" means \"taught how (they) are made\" or \"taught what (they) are like,\" implying the acquisition of knowledge about the inhabitants.

The target text expands on this by adding a new causal clause: 'for they being ignorant of drawing, and designing, and pleasing themselves with their extravagant and grotesque Figures,'. This clause offers an explicit reason (perceived ignorance of European artistic conventions like 'drawing, and designing') and attitude ('pleasing themselves with') for their art style and subsequent criticism of 'our Pictures'. This information is not present in Fontenelle's more neutral description and re-writes the characterization of these 'Peuples', possibly to align with contemporary European cultural assumptions.","The French 'Habitans' (Inhabitants), referring to hypothetical beings on other planets, is translated as 'Animals.' This makes an implicit biological categorization explicit, potentially narrowing Fontenelle's more open-ended philosophical speculation about the nature of extraterrestrial life by specifying a particular kingdom of life (animals) rather than leaving it to broader interpretation.","The French 'tourne sur elle-même' (literally 'turns on herself'), describing Venus's rotation, is translated as 'turns upon her own Axis.' The translator makes the implicit astronomical concept of an axis of rotation explicit by adding the technical term 'Axis,' thereby increasing scientific precision but adding information not literally present in the source's more general phrasing.","The French phrase 'de dedans Venus' (from within Venus / from Venus's perspective), indicating the viewpoint for observing Earth, is translated and expanded to 'to the Inhabitants of Venus'. The translator makes the implied observer explicit by specifying 'the Inhabitants of Venus', thereby directly connecting the astronomical observation to Fontenelle's central theme of hypothetical planetary inhabitants, which is strongly implied but not overtly stated in this particular source phrasing.","The French phrase 'dedans Venus' (within Venus / from Venus's perspective), used in 'elle paroît dedans Venus' to indicate the viewpoint for observing the Moon, is translated and expanded to 'to the Inhabitants of Venus' in the clause 'it must appear to the Inhabitants of Venus'. Similar to the previous instance, the translator makes the implied observer explicit by specifying 'the Inhabitants of Venus,' consistently reinforcing the perspective of hypothetical extraterrestrial beings.","The French 'paroît' (appears), from 'la Terre de dedans Venus paroît', describing how Earth would look from Venus, is rendered as 'must necessarily appear.' The translator explicitly signals the logical deduction and certainty implied by the preceding calculations of relative size by adding 'must necessarily,' where the source 'paroît' is more neutral and less emphatic about the deductive step.","The French 'paroît' (appears), from 'elle paroît dedans Venus', describing how the Moon would look from Venus, is rendered as 'must appear.' The translator makes the implied logical deduction explicit by using 'must appear,' emphasizing the consequence of the stated premises about relative sizes, whereas 'paroît' alone is less emphatic about the deductive process."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Vous m'affligez</span></span>, dit la Marquise.

This explicitation clarifies the degree of the Marquise's expressed emotion, which was implicit in the original phrasing.","The French 'la Terre' (the Earth) is translated as 'our Globe of the Earth.' The addition of 'Globe of' explicitly clarifies that 'Earth' refers to the planet as a spherical celestial body, information that is implicit in the astronomical context but made more concrete.","The French 'de dedans Vénus paroît' (appears from within Venus / as seen from Venus), describing how Earth appears, implies an observer. The translation makes this implied observer explicit by specifying 'to the Inhabitants of Venus,' directly linking the observation to hypothetical beings on Venus.","The French pronoun 'y' (there), in 'la Lune qui y paroît' (the Moon which appears there), refers implicitly to Venus. The translation expands this to 'appears to the World of Venus,' which explicitates the location not just as Venus, but as a 'World,' reinforcing the book's theme of planetary habitability.","The French poetic epithet 'Etoile du Berger' (Shepherd's Star), a name for Venus associated with evening/morning and thus metaphorically with lovers, is translated as 'the lucky Star of their Intrigues.' This explicitation spells out the implied romantic and clandestine connotations, directly linking the star to 'intrigues' and their 'luck,' making the nature of these amours more specific.","The French 'brillante' (shining/bright), describing a planet, is rendered as 'twinkling' in the phrase 'twinkling Planets.' 'Twinkling' specifies a particular kind of light emission/reflection, adding a vivid visual detail that makes the nature of the brightness more explicit than the general term 'brillante.'","The French 'presider aux Amours' (to preside over Loves) is translated as 'to give Laws to the Loves.' This explicitation re-interprets the Moon's role from a more passive 'presiding' to a more active, authoritative one of 'giving Laws,' thus specifying and intensifying the nature of its influence over the Venusians' love lives.","The French 'ces Gens là doivent bien entendre la galanterie.' (those People must be very skilled in/knowledgeable about gallantry) is expanded to 'these People are very soft, and have the Art to please extreamly well.' The translation makes explicit the supposed characteristics ('very soft') and abilities ('have the Art to please') that are implied to result from or constitute being 'skilled in gallantry.'","The French 'elle en reçoit une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur' (it [Venus] receives from it [the Sun] a livelier light and more heat) uses the pronoun 'en' to refer to the Sun. The translation 'receives from its Influence a brighter Light, and a more enlivening Heat' makes the causal link explicit by specifying 'from its Influence,' clarifying that the Sun's power is the source.","The French 'plus de chaleur' (more heat) is translated as 'a more enlivening Heat.' The adjective 'enlivening' is added, making explicit an implied quality or effect of the increased heat, suggesting it is life-giving or passion-stirring, which fits the context of a climate 'favorable aux Amours' (favorable to Loves).","The French 'Peuple noir' (dark/black People), part of 'un petit Peuple noir, brûlé du Soleil' (a small, dark People, burned by the Sun), is focused in the target text's 'a sort of little Sun-burnt Gentlemen' on the word 'Gentlemen'. This addition explicitly assigns a higher social status and specific gender (male) to these inhabitants, which was not specified in the original, more general term 'Peuple' (People).","The French 'des Danses' (Dances), part of a list of entertainments ('Fêtes, des Danses, & des Tournois'), is translated as 'Balls' in the list 'Feasts, Balls and Masquerades.' This explicitation specifies the general term 'Dances' as 'Balls,' a more formal and socially significant type of dance event, making the described entertainment more concrete for the contemporary English reader.","The French 'des Fêtes' (Feasts/Festivals), in the list of entertainments 'des Fêtes, des Danses, & des Tournois', is rendered in the target list 'Feasts, Balls and Masquerades' partly by 'Masquerades'. While 'Feasts' covers the primary meaning, 'Masquerades' is an added specific type of festive entertainment popular in the translator's era, thereby making explicit a particular kind of 'Fête'.","The French 'inventant tous les jours des Fêtes, des Danses, & des Tournois.' (inventing Feasts, Dances, and Tournaments every day) is translated and expanded to 'every Day inventing Feasts, Balls and Masquerades, to entertain their Mistresses.' The addition of the clause 'to entertain their Mistresses' makes explicit the *purpose* of these activities, linking them directly to courtship, a motivation that was only generally implied in the French text by the surrounding romantic context."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P058: Mais que sera-ce des Habitants de Mercure?

The English translation `by having too much Light and Fire` makes this causal link explicit by specifying 'Light and Fire' (elements directly associated with the Sun) as the source of the condition leading to madness.","The French `celle qu'il fait icy au fond de l'Afrique` (the heat that it is deep in Africa) describes an environmental condition. The English translation `the greatest warmth enjoy'd by the Inhabitants of the middle of Africk` makes explicit that this warmth is experienced by 'the Inhabitants' and characterizes it as 'the greatest,' information which was implied but not directly stated about the heat in the source phrase.","The French `pour les glacier` (to freeze them) implies a severe, potentially lethal, freezing effect for beings accustomed to Mercury's heat. The English translation `to frieze them to death` makes the fatal consequence of this freezing explicit by adding 'to death.'","The French `pour observer le mouvement qu'il doit avoir sur son centre` (to observe the movement it must have on its center) implies determining the nature and period of Mercury's rotation. The English translation `as to observe the Time in which he performs his Revolution upon his own Axis or Centre` makes this explicit by: 1) specifying the 'mouvement' as a 'Revolution upon his own Axis' (a more technical astronomical term for rotation), and 2) clarifying that the observation aims to determine 'the Time' (duration/period) of this revolution, which was implied by the earlier statement that Mercury's day length is unknown.","The French `qui va d'une rapidité profigeuse` (which moves with prodigious rapidity) describes the Sun's apparent movement as seen from Mercury. The English translation `which, to their Apprehension, moves with wonderful Rapidity` makes explicit, through the addition of 'to their Apprehension,' that this perceived rapidity is a subjective experience of Mercury's inhabitants.","The French `Cela en est mieux pour eux` (That is better for them), in the context of them longing for the night, implies a reason why night is preferred. The English translation adds the clause `which, no doubt, must be much more grateful to 'em than the Day` to explicitly state this reason – that night offers relief and is more pleasant compared to the harsh Mercurian day described earlier.","The French `pendant ce temps-là` (during that time) refers to nighttime on Mercury. The English translation `during those cooler Hours` makes explicit an implied characteristic of this nighttime – its coolness ('cooler Hours') – which contrasts with the extreme heat of Mercury's day described previously.","The French `cette grande voûte` (this great vault), in an astronomical context, refers to the celestial sphere or sky.

Serieusement il me paroîtroit plus regulier &amp; plus uniforme que toutes les Planetes, grandes &amp; petites, n'eussent que le même mouvement autour du Soleil! </p><p>P064: Ah! Madame, répliquai-je, Si vous saviez ce que c'est que les <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Tourbillons</span></span> de Descartes, ces Tourbillons dont le nom est si terrible, &amp; l'idée si agreable, vous ne parleriez pas comme vous faites.

Je ne vous connaissois pas de pareils emportements, répris-je; c'est dommage qu'ils n'ayent que les Tourbillons pour objet. Ce qu'on appelle un Tourbillon, c'est un amas de matiere dont les parties sont détachées les unes des autres, &amp; se meuvent toutes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">en un même sens</span></span>; permis à elles d'avoir pendant ce temps-là quelques petites mouvements particuliers, pourveu qu'elles suivent toûjours le <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">mouvement general</span></span>. Ainsi <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">un Tourbillon de vent</span></span>, c'est une infinité de petites parties d'air, qui tournent en rond toutes ensemble, &amp; enveloppent ce qu'elles rencontrent. Vous savez que les Planetes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">sont portées</span></span> dans la matiere celeste, qui est d'une subtilité, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">d'une agitation prodigieuse</span></span>. Tout ce grand amas de matiere celeste, qui est depuis le Soleil jusqu'aux <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">Etoiles fixes</span></span>, tourne en rond, &amp; emportant avec soy les Planetes, les fait tourner toutes en un même sens autour du Soleil, qui occupe le centre; mais en des temps plus ou moins longs, selon qu'elles en sont plus ou moins éloignées. Il n'y a pas jusqu'au Soleil qui ne tourne; mais il ne tourne que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">sur luy-même</span></span>, parce qu'il est justement au milieu de toute cette matiere celeste; &amp; vous remarquerez en passant, que quand la Terre seroit dans la place où il est, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle- même</span></span>. </p><p>P065: Voilà quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme le Maître; mais en même temps les Planetes se composent de petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">celuy du Soleil</span></span>. Chacune d'elles en tournant autour du Soleil, ne laisse pas de tourner autour d'elle-même, &amp; fait tourner aussi autour d'elle en même sens une certaine quantité de cette matière céleste, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">qui est toûjours prête à suivre tous les mouvements qu'on luy veut donner</span></span>, s'ils ne la détournent pas de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">son mouvement general</span></span>. C'est là le Tourbillon particulier de la Planete &amp; elle le pousse aussi loin que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"20\">la force de son mouvement se peut étendre</span></span>. S'il faut qu'il tombe dans ce petit Tourbillon quelque Planete moindre que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"21\">celle qui y domine</span></span>, la voilà emportée par la grande &amp; forcée indispensablement à tourner autour d'elle, &amp; le tout ensemble, la grande Planete, la petite, &amp; le Tourbillon qui les renferme, n'en tourne pas moins autour du Soleil. C'est ainsi qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"22\">au commencement du Monde</span></span> nous nous fîmes suivre par la Lune, parce qu'elle se trouva dans <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"23\">l'étenduë de notre Tourbillon</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"24\">&amp; tout à fait à notre bienséance</span></span>.

Il est quatre vingt- dix-fois plus gros que nous, il nous auroit engloutis sans peine dans son Tourbillon, &amp; nous ne serions qu'une Lune de sa dépendance, au lieu que nous en avons une qui est dans la nôtre, tant il est vray que le seul hazard de la situation décide souvent de toute la fortune qu'on doit avoir. </p><p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes? Je commence à craindre que nous ne fassions la folie de nous approcher d'une Planete aussi entreprenante que Jupiter, ou qu'il ne vienne vers nous <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"27\">pour nous absorber</span></span>; car il me paroît que dans ce grand mouvement, où vous dites qu'est la matière Celeste, elle devroit agiter les Planetes irregulièrement, tantôt les approcher, tantôt les éloigner les unes des autres. Nous pourrions aussi-tôt y gagner qu'y perdre, répondis-je, peut être irions- nous soumettre à notre domination Mercure &amp; Venus, qui sont de petites Planetes, &amp; qui ne nous pourroient résister. Mais nous n'avons rien à esperer ny à craindre; les Planetes se tiennent où elles sont, &amp; les nouvelles conquêtes leur sont défenduës, comme elles l'étoient autrefois aux Rois de la Chine. Vous savez bien que quand on met de l'huile avec de l'eau, l'huile surnage. Qu'on mette sur ces deux liqueurs un Corps extremement léger, l'huile le soûtiendra, &amp; il n'ira pas jusqu'à l'eau. Qu'on y mette un autre Corps plus pesant, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"28\">&amp; qui soit justement d'une certaine pesanteur</span></span>, il passera au travers de l'huile, qui sera trop foible pour l'arrêter, &amp; tombera jusqu'à ce qu'il rencontre l'eau, qui aura la force de le soûtenir. Ainsi dans cette liqueur composée de deux liqueurs qui ne se mêlent point, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"29\">deux Corps inégalement pesants se mettent naturellement à deux places differentes</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"30\">&amp; jamais l'un ne montera, ny l'autre ne descendra</span></span>. Qu'on mette encore d'autres liqueurs <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"31\">qui se tiennent separées</span></span>, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"32\">qu'on y plonge d'autres corps</span></span>, il arrivera la même chose. Représentez-vous que la Matiere Celeste qui remplit ce grand Tourbillon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"33\">à differentes couches qui s'enveloppent les unes les autres</span></span>, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"34\">dont les pesanteurs sont différentes</span></span>, comme celles de l'huile &amp; de l'eau, &amp; des autres liqueurs.

But, pray, Madam, allow me to tell you, that you who have corrected me so justly, may also be mistaken your self: The Inhabitants of the Sun wou'd not so much as see it self; for they wou'd be incapable to support the dazling of his Light, or unable to receive it, by being too near; and all things well consider'd, the Sun wou'd be a Country of blind Men only. So that, once for all, I conclude, the Sun cannot be inhabited; and if you please, Madam, we will continue our Journey to the other Worlds: We are now come to the Centre, which is the lowest Point in all Circular Figures; and therefore must return back again, and go upwards. In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited.</p> <p>P049: The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and his Inhabitants see the Sun neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">Guards</span></span>: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light. But, pray, Madam, allow me to tell you, that you who have corrected me so justly, may also be mistaken your self: The Inhabitants of the Sun wou'd not so much as see it self; for they wou'd be incapable to support the dazling of his Light, or unable to receive it, by being too near; and all things well consider'd, the Sun wou'd be a Country of blind Men only. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">So that, once for all, I conclude</span></span>, the Sun cannot be inhabited; and if you please, Madam, we will continue our Journey to the other Worlds: We are now come to the Centre, which is the lowest Point in <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">all Circular Figures</span></span>; and therefore must return back again, and go upwards. In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited. </p><p>P049: The next that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">presents it self to our Observation</span></span> is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">his Inhabitants see the Sun</span></span> neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Moons, or Guards</span></span>: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Tourbillions, or Whistlings</span></span> of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">make haste therefore to satisfie me</span></span>, I'll manage my self no longer, but <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve</span></span>, let the World talk what they please; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">but let me understand these Whirling's</span></span>. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">general Circular Motion</span></span>. As for Example; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain</span></span>, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">are carry'd round</span></span> in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">swift</span></span>; all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">Sphere of the fixed Stars</span></span>, turns round, and carries with it the Planets <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">one way, from East to West</span></span>, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">upon his own Axis</span></span>: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that</span></span>: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">that great one, the Sun</span></span>; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"18\">which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives</span></span>, provided that does not obstruct <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"19\">its general Motion round the Sun</span></span>; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"20\">the Sphere of its Activity can reach</span></span>; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"21\">that which governs the Tourbillion</span></span> comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"22\">after the Creation of the Universe</span></span>, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"23\">the Extent or Sphere of Activity</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"24\">and forc'd its Obedience</span></span>. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"25\">had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter</span></span>, you may easily believe <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"26\">he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also</span></span>, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"27\">who may sweep us round with it self</span></span>; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"28\">of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil</span></span>, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"29\">rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"30\">so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend.</span></span> If you add other Liquors <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"31\">that will not mingle together</span></span>, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"32\">throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight</span></span>, 'twill still be the same thing.

The addition 'to our Observation' explicitly clarifies the context in which Mars is being considered, i.e., as an object of their scientific discussion and observation.","The French 'il voit le Soleil' (it [Mars] sees the Sun, or one sees the Sun from it) is translated as 'his Inhabitants see the Sun'. This makes explicit *who* is doing the seeing from Mars, aligning with the book's theme of extraterrestrial life and popularizing the idea of planetary inhabitants.","The French 'Lunes ou Satellites' (Moons or Satellites) is translated as 'Moons, or Guards'. While 'satellite' derives from Latin for attendant/guard, the English 'Guards' makes this specific relational aspect (of Jupiter's moons to Jupiter) more vivid and explicit for a general reader than the potentially more abstract or purely technical 'Satellites'.","The French 'Tourbillons' (whirlwinds/vortices) is translated as 'Tourbillions, or Whistlings'. The addition of 'or Whistlings' offers an alternative, more sensory (auditory) and perhaps more common-language term to help the reader grasp Descartes's concept, thereby explicitating one possible perceived characteristic of the phenomenon.","The Marquise's French exclamation 'Achevez de me rendre folle' (Finish driving me mad [with curiosity]) is rendered as 'make haste therefore to satisfie me'. This translation explicitly spells out her urgent desire for an explanation, which was an emotional implication in the source.","The French 'je ne connois plus de retenuë sur la Philosophie' (I no longer know any restraint regarding philosophy) is expanded to 'henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve'. The English translation spells out more fully the manner and totality of her commitment to philosophical inquiry.","The French '& donnons-nous aux Tourbillons' (and let's give ourselves to the Tourbillons) is translated as 'but let me understand these Whirling's'. This makes explicit the Marquise's desire for comprehension ('let me understand') rather than just immersion, and re-uses the translator's explicitating term 'Whirling's'.","The French 'mouvement general' (general motion) of the tourbillon is translated as 'general Circular Motion'. The addition of 'Circular' explicitly defines the geometric nature of this motion, which is implied by the term 'tourbillon' but not stated in 'mouvement general'.","The French 'un Tourbillon de vent' (a whirlwind of wind) is translated as 'A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain'. The translator adds common English equivalents 'Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain', making the scientific concept more explicit and readily understandable by linking it to familiar meteorological terms.","The French 'sont portées' (are carried), referring to the planets in the celestial matter, is translated as 'are carry'd round'. The addition of 'round' explicitly specifies the direction of this carrying motion, crucial to the vortex theory being explained.","The French 'd'une agitation prodigieuse' (of a prodigious agitation/movement), describing the celestial matter, is rendered by 'swift'. This specifies the *nature* of the 'agitation' as being rapid, making an implied characteristic explicit.","The French 'Etoiles fixes' (fixed Stars) is translated as 'Sphere of the fixed Stars'. The addition of 'Sphere' makes the prevailing cosmological model (where fixed stars were thought to be embedded in a celestial sphere) explicit for the reader.","The French 'en un même sens' (in the same direction) for the planets' motion around the Sun is translated as 'one way, from East to West'. This makes the 'same direction' more specific by providing a (then common, though complex in heliocentric context) astronomical directional reference.","The French 'sur luy-même' (on itself), referring to the Sun's rotation, is translated as 'upon his own Axis'. The addition of 'Axis' makes the type of rotation explicit using precise astronomical terminology.","The French 'elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle- même' (it [Earth] could still not do less than turn on itself) is translated as 'she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that'. 'Upon her own Axis' makes the rotation type explicit, and 'like that' spells out the implied comparison to the Sun's rotation.","The French 'celuy du Soleil' (that of the Sun), referring to the Sun's tourbillon, is translated as 'that great one, the Sun'. This explicitly names 'the Sun' and adds the descriptive 'that great one', enhancing clarity and emphasis.","The French 'qui est toûjours prête à suivre tous les mouvements qu'on luy veut donner' (which [celestial matter] is always ready to follow all the movements one wants to give it) is translated as 'which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives'. This explains *how* the matter is ready to follow by detailing its responsive property, making the mechanism more explicit.","The French 'son mouvement general' (its general motion) regarding a planet's tourbillon is translated as 'its general Motion round the Sun'. Adding 'round the Sun' explicitly specifies the reference point and nature of this overarching movement.","The French 'la force de son mouvement se peut étendre' (the force of its movement can extend) describing a planet's tourbillon, is translated as 'the Sphere of its Activity can reach'. 'Sphere of Activity' is a more formal and specific term, explicitly defining the tourbillon's extent as a distinct region of influence.","The French 'celle qui y domine' (that which dominates there), referring to the main planet in a small tourbillon, is translated as 'that which governs the Tourbillion'. This provides a more explicit description of the dominant planet's role and function within its vortex system.","The French 'au commencement du Monde' (at the beginning of the World) is translated as 'after the Creation of the Universe'. This phrasing is more specific and grander, explicitly linking the event to a concept of universal creation, potentially resonating with contemporary scientific-theological discourse.","The French 'l'étenduë de notre Tourbillon' (the extent of our Tourbillon) is translated as 'the Extent or Sphere of Activity'. The term 'Sphere of Activity' is re-used to explicitly define this region of influence with a more scientific-sounding term.","The French phrase '& tout à fait à notre bienséance' (and entirely to our convenience/suitability), describing the Moon's relation to Earth's tourbillon, is translated as 'and forc'd its Obedience'. This makes the implied power dynamic explicit, reinterpreting 'bienséance' as a result of Earth's dominant force.","The French conditional 'si nous nous fussions trouvés proches de luy [Jupiter]' (if we had found ourselves near him) is translated as 'had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter'. This makes the nature of the proximity explicit by directly linking it to Descartes' vortex theory and the mechanism of capture.","The French rhetorical question 'croyez-vous que nous l'eussions êté [une Planète principale]' (do you believe we would have been it [a principal planet]?) is translated by explicitly stating the consequence: 'he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also'. This spells out what the loss of principal status would entail.","The French 'pour nous absorber' (to absorb us), referring to Jupiter's potential action on Earth, is translated as 'who may sweep us round with it self'. This explains the *mechanism* of 'absorption' according to the vortex theory, making the process more explicit.","The French '& qui soit justement d'une certaine pesanteur' (and which is precisely of a certain heaviness), describing a body placed in oil/water, is translated as 'of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil'. This explicitly states the *functional characteristic* of this specific weight – its proportionality to the task of penetrating the oil layer.","The French 'deux Corps inégalement pesants se mettent naturellement à deux places differentes' (two unequally heavy bodies naturally place themselves in two different places) is translated regarding their final state as resting 'in two different Positions, the one above the other'. The addition 'the one above the other' explicitly describes the spatial relationship implied by different densities and the layering of liquids.","The French '& jamais l'un ne montera, ny l'autre ne descendra' (and never will one rise, nor the other descend) is clarified as 'so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend'. This explicitly assigns the behaviors (not descending, not ascending) to the correct type of body (lightest, heaviest).","The French 'qui se tiennent separées' (that keep themselves separate), describing different liquors, is translated as 'that will not mingle together'. This explicitly states the property of immiscibility as the reason for their separation.","The French 'qu'on y plonge d'autres corps' (and one plunges other bodies into them) is expanded to 'throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight'. The additions 'as many Bodies' and particularly 'of proportionable weight' make explicit the quantity and the crucial characteristic (appropriate weight for each layer) of these bodies, reinforcing the scientific principle being illustrated.","The French 'à differentes couches qui s'enveloppent les unes les autres' (has different layers that envelop one another) is translated as 'is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion;'. The addition of the simile 'like an Onion' provides a concrete, everyday analogy to make the concept of nested layers explicit and more easily visualized.","The French 'dont les pesanteurs sont différentes' (whose heavinesses/weights are different), describing the layers of celestial matter, is translated as 'these Coats are of different weights and force'. The addition of 'and force' explicitly introduces the concept of force related to these layers, important for explaining how they support planets.","The French 'chacune d'elles par consequent s'arrête dans la couche qui a précisément la force necessaire pour la soûtenir' (each of them consequently stops in the layer that has precisely the necessary force to support it) is translated as 'every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight'. The phrase 'proportionable to its weight' explicitly states the direct relationship between the planet's weight and the characteristic of the celestial layer it settles in.","The French 'il n'est pas possible qu'elle en sorte jamais' (it is not possible that it ever leaves it) is translated as 'it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence'. The addition of 'in Nature' explicitly grounds this impossibility in the laws of Natural Philosophy, giving the statement a stronger scientific authority."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P067: Je conçois, dit la Marquise, que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs</span></span>.

The addition of \"Madam\" makes the form of address by the philosopher to the Marquise explicit. This introduces a specific marker of politeness or social standing into the dialogue that is not explicitly present in the French source text at this point, thus altering the directness of the original.","The French \"à en éclairer une autre\" (literally \"to enlighten another one,\" referring to another planet) implies that the planet is illuminated, which would by extension benefit any inhabitants. The English translation \"to enlighten the Inhabitants of a greater [planet]\" makes this explicit by specifying that the direct beneficiaries of the enlightenment are \"the Inhabitants\" of the other planet, rather than just the planet itself. This clarifies the purpose of the light by focusing it on sentient beings, a nuance that was only implied.","The French sentence simply expresses the Marquise's wish for the inhabitants of Jupiter's moons to constantly see the large planet hanging over them. The English translation significantly expands upon this initial wish. The majority of the target text segment – specifically the detailed speculation about the moons being 'Colonies of Iupiter,' receiving 'Laws and Manners,' paying 'Homage and Respect,' sending 'Ambassadors,' and swearing 'Fealty,' as well as the philosopher's interjections and comparisons regarding authority – constitutes a substantial addition by the translator. This added material spells out complex political and social relationships and hierarchies between Jupiter and its lunar inhabitants, themes entirely absent and not implied in the concise French original, thereby re-writing the scope and nature of the Marquise's initial thought.","Similar to a previous instance, the French \"répondis-je.\" (I replied.) is translated as \"said I, Madam,\". The translator again makes the form of address by the philosopher to the Marquise explicit, reinforcing a level of expressed formality or social convention in their dialogue that is not explicitly stated in the French source.","The French \"en sortant de son logis\" (on leaving his lodging/house) contextually implies the start of the day for Tycho Brahe's superstitious observation. The English translation adds the parenthetical phrase \"(as he went out of his House in the Morning)\", making this temporal context explicit and clarifying a detail about the timing of the event that was only implied in the source.","The French \"la moindre chose.\" (the slightest thing.) uses the general term \"chose\" (thing). The English translation \"Business of the smallest Consequence.\" makes this more specific. It explicitly frames Tycho Brahe's avoidance in terms of 'Business' or undertakings of some import, rather than any abstract 'thing.' This narrows the scope and clarifies the nature of his superstitious inaction by specifying the kind of activities he would avoid."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit- elle, après que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">de la</span></span>, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The addition of 'of Nature' makes explicit that the law pertains to the workings of the natural world, a central theme in Fontenelle's popularization of natural philosophy.","The French pronoun 'le' in 'que nous ne le voyons' (than we see it) anaphorically refers to Jupiter. The translation 'than Iupiter appears to us' explicitly names Jupiter, clarifying the object of comparison for the reader.","'Le Journal des Savants,' a specific French scientific periodical, is translated as 'the Philosophical Transactions,' its prominent English contemporary from that period.

The addition of 'or Revolution' makes explicit the specific astronomical term for orbital movement, thereby enhancing scientific clarity.","The French 'notre Terre est un Monde.' (our Earth is a World.) uses 'Monde,' which contextually implies both a celestial body and a potentially inhabited realm. The translation 'our Earth is a Planet and a World:' makes this dual nature explicit by adding 'a Planet,' thereby clarifying its astronomical classification alongside its broader philosophical designation.","The French 'Lunette,' in the context of astronomical observation ('au bout d'une Lunette' - through/at the end of a 'Lunette'), is translated as 'Telescope.'

The translator makes explicit: (1) that \"nous\" (us), referring to the interlocutors on Earth, corresponds to \"our Earth\" as the object of observation, and (2) that the general agent \"on\" (one/they) performing the action from Jupiter are \"the Inhabitants of Iupiter\". This clarifies who is observing and what is being observed in a way that is implied by the context and Fontenelle's overall theme but not directly stated in the French phrase.","The French \"comme les nôtres le sont vers luy\" (as ours are [aimed] towards it) describes the orientation of Earth's telescopes. The translation \"and ours from a mutual Curiosity are levell'd at them\" explicitly adds the motivation \"from a mutual Curiosity\" for this action. While \"mutual curiosity\" is mentioned immediately after in the French source text in relation to the planets considering each other (`& cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considèrent`), the translator brings this motivation forward and directly links it to the act of aiming the telescopes, making an implied causal link explicit at this specific point in the sentence.","The French `demandent l'une de l'autre` (ask one another), whose grammatical subject is \"les Planetes\" from the preceding conjoined clause \"les Planetes s'entre-considèrent &...\", is translated as \"the Inhabitants of both ask at one and the same time\". The translator makes two explicitations: (1) The agent asking the questions is changed from the personified \"les Planetes\" (the Planets) to the more direct \"the Inhabitants of both [planets]\", explicitly naming the hypothetical beings central to the work's speculative theme. (2) The reciprocity and implied simultaneity of \"demandent l'une de l'autre\" is rendered with an explicit emphasis on simultaneous action through the phrase \"at one and the same time\"."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P075: Cela ne va pas si vite que vous pensez, <span class=\"highlight-text-c<span class=\"highlight-text-c<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">on</span></span>tainer\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">on</span></span>tainer\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">répliqua<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">y</span></span>-je</span></span>.

This specifies the agent as the population of Jupiter, which is more general in the French.","The French phrase 'nôtre Terre ce n'est pas nous' (our Earth, it is not us) presents an abstract distinction. The English translation 'they cou'd never see us' makes explicit the perceptual consequence of this distinction for hypothetical Jovian observers, spelling out an implied limitation.","The French 'tout Jupiter' (all Jupiter), referring to the collective reaction on the planet, is translated and clarified as 'the rest of the Inhabitants.' This explicitation specifies that the reaction comes from the population of Jupiter (not the planet itself as an entity) and adds precision by indicating 'the rest' (i.e., those not holding the foolish opinion).","The French 'se moque de luy' (mocks him / makes fun of him) is translated and expanded to 'he wou'd be laugh'd at and ridicul'd.' The addition of 'ridicul'd' spells out a more specific and severe form of mockery, making an implied aspect of the social consequence more explicit.","The French locative pronoun 'y' (there), in 'qu'on y a fait le procés', implicitly refers to Jupiter. The translation 'in that World' makes this location explicit, removing potential ambiguity and clearly stating where the philosophers are prosecuted.","The French phrase 'fait le procés à' (to put on trial / to prosecute) is translated and significantly expanded to 'sued and persecuted.' This explicitation spells out more severe and specific potential consequences ('persecuted') beyond the general legal process implied by the French, possibly to resonate with contemporary anxieties or historical examples of persecution for philosophical or scientific views.","The French relative clause 'qui ont voulu soûtenir que nous êtions' (who wanted to maintain that we existed/were), which describes the philosophers' stance, is summarized and reframed in the target text as 'for this Opinion:'. This explicitly identifies their belief as 'this Opinion' and directly presents it as the punishable cause, making the causal relationship more patent.","The French 'leurs Christophe Colombs' (their Christopher Columbuses), referring to generic explorer types on Jupiter, is re-written as a specific hypothetical scenario involving 'And had Christopher Columbus been of that Country, and understanding Navigation so well,'. The translation explicitly adds conditions of origin ('of that Country') and specific skill ('understanding Navigation so well'), articulating characteristics that were only implied by the archetypal name in the source and changing a general plural to a detailed singular example.","The French impersonal pronoun 'on' (one/they), subject of 'ne nous voit point' in 'Si on ne nous voit point', is again translated explicitly as 'the Inhabitants of Iupiter'. This reiterates the specification of the agent as the Jovian population, which is more general in the French.","The French possessive pronoun 'les siennes' (its own), referring to Saturn's moons in a general way ('Saturne avec les siennes'), is translated as 'the five that belong to him.' This makes the information explicit by adding the specific number 'five,' reflecting the contemporary astronomical knowledge of Saturn's moons (five were known by 1684).

The English translation \"all that you say\" makes the referent of \"cela\" (the philosopher's preceding discourse) explicit.","The French \"la Nature a eu en veüe les besoins\" (Nature had in view/mind the needs) implies consideration. The English \"Nature has seen and provided for the necessity\" makes explicit an action of 'providing for' those needs, which is an interpretation beyond merely 'having in view'.","The French relative pronoun \"qui\" (who), subject of \"comptent\" (esteem) in \"qui les comptent apparemment...\", implicitly refers to the inhabitants of Venus and Mercury. The English translation makes this implicit subject explicit by using the noun phrase \"the Inhabitants of this Planet\" as the subject of \"esteem\".","The French \"Mais attendez,\" (But wait,) is a continuation of the Marquise's established speech. The English translation inserts the speech attribution \"said Madam the Marquiese,\" making the speaker explicit again at this point, even though already known.","The French pronoun \"il\" (it) in \"il faut qu'il ait pour ses nuits des ressources\" refers to the planet Mars, suggesting the planet itself possesses resources. The English translation shifts the focus by stating \"the Inhabitants of that Planet enjoy some other advantage,\" making explicit that the inhabitants are the beneficiaries of these resources.","The French \"des ressources que nous ne savons pas.\" (resources that we do not know) is a general statement. The English translation adds the clause \"which supplies that defect.\" to \"some other advantage,\" making explicit the function of these resources – to compensate for Mars's lack of a moon (\"that defect\" refers to \"he has none\" mentioned prior), a purpose that was implied but not directly stated in the source.","The French \"Phosphores naturels\" (natural phosphors) is a relatively specific scientific term. The English translation \"naturally of such a kind of Substance\" clarifies this by explaining that these are substances inherently possessing phosphorescent qualities, thus making the nature of \"natural phosphors\" more explicit for a general reader.","The French \"une provision de lumière\" (a provision of light) is expanded in the English translation to \"great Provision of Light in the Day time from the Sun\". The addition of \"great\" intensifies the noun, and \"from the Sun\" makes the source of the light explicit in this specific context of Martian rocks, reinforcing a detail mentioned generally for phosphors in the previous sentence but not reiterated here.","The English translation prefaces the clause corresponding to the French \"Vous ne sauriez rier...\" with \"and if it be so,\". This addition makes explicit the conditional link to the preceding hypothesis about phosphorescent rocks on Mars. This link was implied in the French by context and the earlier use of \"Peut-être\" (Perhaps) but not overtly stated as a preface here.","The French \"un Spectacle\" (a spectacle, sight, show) is translated and expanded to \"a Scene or Representation.\" The addition of \"or Representation\" offers an alternative or more specific term, clarifying and elaborating on the nature of the visual experience implied by \"Spectacle.\"","The French \"sans aucun art\" (without any art/artifice) is translated as \"without Art or Expence.\" The addition of \"or Expence\" makes explicit an associated characteristic of natural (artless) illuminations – that they would also be cost-free, an idea implied but not stated in the source.","The French \"qu'on s'en peut servir pour lire.\" (that one can use them [the birds' light] to read) states the functional possibility. The English translation adds \"as well as by that of a Candle,\" making explicit a comparison to a familiar standard of brightness, thereby clarifying the quality or sufficiency of the light for reading.","The French \"vont répandre un nouveau jour?\" (go to spread a new day/light?) implies that this light is spread over Mars, the subject of discussion. The English translation \"enlighten that World\" makes the location explicit by specifying \"that World\" (i.e., Mars)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oiseaux.

The English translation intensifies this to \"absolutely necessary\" and explicitly extends this necessity \"as well to Mars.\" This spells out a connection to the Marquise's preceding remark about Mars being an exception, a line of reasoning that was only implicitly suggested in the source.","The French \"si vous vous mêliez de Philosophie plus que vous ne faites\" (if you engaged more with Philosophy than you do) is expanded to \"if you think it worth your pains to make any further Progress in Philosophy.\" The translator adds the notions of \"worth your pains\" and \"further Progress,\" making explicit the implied effort, deliberation, and the developmental aspect of engaging more deeply with philosophy, which were not directly stated in the more concise French.","The French uses the pronoun \"en\" (them/some), implicitly referring to \"Habitans\" (Inhabitants) from the Marquise's immediately preceding question (\"Et ne mettrons-nous point d'Habitans dans ce grand Anneau\"). The English translation spells this out by using the full noun \"Inhabitants\" in \"to put Inhabitants every where,\" making the referent explicit and reinforcing the subject of the philosopher's hypothetical action.","The French description \"un Cercle de Lunes qui se suivissent de fort prés\" (a circle of Moons that followed one another very closely) is translated as \"Moons join'd very near together.\" The word \"join'd\" suggests a more direct physical connection or a tighter, more integrated formation than merely \"following closely,\" thus making the suspected nature of this celestial ring more explicit.","The French \"eussent un mouvement égal\" (had an equal motion) is expanded in the English translation to \"having all an equal Motion, and turning one way.\" The addition of \"and turning one way\" provides specific clarifying astronomical information about the nature of this \"equal motion\" which was not stated in the source, thereby making a characteristic of the hypothesized lunar circle explicit.","The English translation adds the clause \"I spoke of\" to the phrase \"the five little Moons.\" This addition explicitly links these particular moons to a previous mention or understanding within the dialogue, spelling out a conversational or contextual connection that was left implicit in the French text.","The French scientific term \"le Tourbillon de Saturne\" (the Vortex of Saturn), a concept from Cartesian physics, is translated as \"the Tourbillion or whirlings of Saturn.\" The addition of \"or whirlings\" functions as an explanatory gloss, clarifying the potentially unfamiliar term \"Tourbillion\" for the English audience by providing a more common descriptive synonym.","The general French phrase \"Quoy qu'il en soit\" (be that as it may / whatever the case) is rendered more specifically in English as \"and yet whatever is the Cause.\" The addition of \"the Cause\" makes an explicit link to the immediately preceding speculation about the true nature or formation (the cause) of Saturn's ring, clarifying the referent of \"il\" (it) within the French idiom in this context.","The French rhetorical question \"mais quelle lumiere,\" (but what light,) implies that the light is poor or feeble. The English translation makes this implication explicit by immediately following the question \"but what kind of Light?\" with the assertive answer \"Sure a very feeble one,\" thus spelling out the evaluation of the light's quality that was only suggested in the source.","The French uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" in \"on est bien sage dans Saturne\" (one is very wise in Saturn). The English translation replaces \"on\" with the specific noun phrase \"the Inhabitants of Saturn,\" making the subject of the characteristic (wisdom) explicit and removing ambiguity.","The French \"tout le monde êtoit fou dans Mercure\" (everyone was mad in Mercury) is translated as \"the Inhabitants of Mercury were down-right mad.\" The general term \"tout le monde\" (everyone) is specified as \"the Inhabitants of Mercury,\" explicitly identifying the group being discussed. Additionally, \"down-right\" intensifies \"fou\" (mad), making the degree of their madness more explicit.","The proper noun \"Caton d'Utique\" (Cato of Utica) is expanded in the translation to \"the grave Cato the Censor.\" The translator adds the descriptive epithet \"the grave\" and the historical identifier \"the Censor,\" providing clarifying information about the Roman figure. This would aid an English reader's comprehension, as this specific knowledge might not be as readily assumed as for Fontenelle's contemporary French audience.","The French description \"trop badin & trop folâtre\" (too playful and too frolicsome) is translated as \"too wild and youthful for their Conversation.\" The addition of the phrase \"for their Conversation\" makes explicit the specific context in which Cato's demeanor would be judged inappropriate by the phlegmatic Saturnians, a situational relevance that was only implied in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P082: Il me vient une pensée, dit-elle.

At least, for to Morrow, answer'd I, I hope you shall not want; for I have the fixed Stars prepared for you, which surpass all you have hitherto heard.</p>","explanations":["The French 'lents' (slow), referring to the inhabitants of Saturn, is translated as 'extremely dull.' The translator makes explicit the *type* of slowness as 'dull' (slow-witted, uninteresting) and adds the intensifier 'extremely,' making the characterization more specific and emphatic than the original.","The French 'lents' (slow), referring to some people on Earth, is translated as 'as insipid.' 'Insipid' (lacking vigor or interest) makes explicit a specific characteristic implied by 'lents' in the context of human temperament, clarifying the nature of their slowness.","The French 'au milieu des autres Mondes' (in the middle of the other Worlds) is translated as 'in the middle, between these two Worlds.' The translator explicitly specifies that 'autres Mondes' refers to Mercury and Saturn, which were the immediately preceding subjects of discussion, clarifying a potentially general reference.","The French 'nous participons des extrémitez' (we participate in the extremes) is expanded to 'we participate so of the Qualities of both these Extremes.' The translation explicitly clarifies that 'extrémitez' refers to the 'Qualities' (of being lively or slow/dull) associated with the inhabitants of Mercury and Saturn.","The French 'nous sommes justement dans un endroit de la Terre' (we are precisely in a place on Earth) is translated as 'we have the good luck over and above, to be born in a Climate of this Earth.' The translator makes explicit that the 'endroit' (place) refers to a 'Climate' and introduces the concept of being 'born' there, changing the simple statement of presence ('nous sommes' - we are) to one of origin and circumstance.","The French 'lieux' (places) in the phrase 'un des lieux les plus temperez de cette Planete' (one of the most temperate places of this Planet) is translated as 'Climate' in 'the most temperate Climate of that Planet.' This specifies that the 'places' refer to climatic zones, making the basis of temperateness explicit.","The French 'température' in 'la température de vôtre Pays' (the temperature of your Country) is rendered as 'the temperate Qualities of your Country.' The singular 'température' is expanded to 'temperate Qualities,' making explicit that it refers to the general, multi-faceted climatic nature of the country rather than a single temperature measurement.","The French 'où je suis placée' (where I am placed/located) is translated as 'where I was born.' The translator makes an explicit inference about the reason for the Marquise's location, changing a statement about her current situation ('am placed') to one about her origin ('was born').","The French 'un goût qui les mette à profit' (a taste/inclination that puts them to use/profit) is expanded to 'such a Sense and Taste ... as to turn all to our Advantage and Profit.' The translation uses a doublet ('Sense and Taste' for 'goût') and explicitly details the outcome of 'mettre à profit' as turning things to 'our Advantage and Profit,' clarifying the nature of the appreciation and the resulting benefit.","The French 'Si on ne vouloit que des plaisirs vifs' (If one only wanted intense pleasures) is rephrased as 'If we shou'd look after no other Pleasure or Satisfaction, than this World afforded.' The translator makes explicit an interpretation of 'plaisirs vifs' as specifically 'worldly' pleasures by adding 'than this World afforded,' a nuance that is implied by contrast in the source but not directly stated.","The source philosopher asks if the Marquise, when tempted by 'plaisirs vifs', 'vous vous souviendriez des Tourbillons & de moy, & que vous vous borneriez à nous?' (would remember the Whirlpools and me, and limit yourself to us?). This 'us' implicitly represents philosophical pleasure. The translation recasts this entire question as 'If Philosophy be the Pleasure, you propose, said I, Madam, I have the Boldness to wish, that when you remember the Tourbillions, you wou'd be pleas'd to think of me.' The introduction of 'Philosophy' explicitly names the nature of the intellectual alternative that was only implied by 'Tourbillons & de moy' and 'nous' in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: CINQUIEME SOIR.

Notre Soleil a des Planetes qu'il éclaire, pourquoy chaque Etoile Fixe n'en aura-t-elle pas aussi qu'elle éclairera?

Les Habitans d'une Planete d'un de ces Tourbillons infinis voyent de tous côtés les centres lumineux des Tourbuillons dont ils sont environnez, mais ils n'ont garde d'en voir les Planetes qui n'ayant qu'une lumiere foible, empruntée de leur Soleil, ne la poussent point au delà de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">leur Monde</span></span>.. </p><p>P089: Vous m'offrez, dit-elle, une espece de Perspective si longue, que la veuë n'en peut attraper le bout.

If the fix'd Stars, receive their Light from the Sun, it must certainly be very weak and faint before it comes to 'em, having passed through a hundred and fifty Millions of Miles of the Celestial Substance, I spoke of before: Then consider, the fix'd Stars are oblig'd, to reflect this borrow'd Light upon us at the same distance, which Is every fixt Star the Center of a Tourbillion; and it may be full as big as our Sun? Is it possible, that all this Immense space, wherein our Sun and Planets have their Revolution, is nothing but an inconsiderable part of the Universe?

The English translation makes explicit the medium ('Celestial Substance,' likely referencing Cartesian physics) through which light travels and adds a meta-discursive reminder ('I spoke of before'), clarifying information Fontenelle left implicit.","The French 'cloüées' (nailed) referring to stars is translated with an elaborated image: 'placed, as it were so many golden Nails or Studs.' The translator makes the visual metaphor explicit by adding descriptive details ('golden,' 'Studs') not present in the single French word.","The French 'mille & mille Tourbillons' (a thousand and a thousand vortices) is translated as 'a thousand and a thousand different Tourbillions or Whirlings.' The addition of 'or Whirlings' explicitly provides an English equivalent for 'Tourbillons,' and 'different' specifies their variety, making implied nuances explicit.","The French term 'notre Tourbillon' (our vortex) is translated as 'our Tourbillion or Whirling.' The addition of 'or Whirling' explicitly provides an English equivalent or explanatory gloss for the potentially unfamiliar French scientific term 'Tourbillion,' enhancing clarity.","The French 'leur Monde' (their World), referring to the domain of a distant solar system, is translated as 'its own Sphere or Activity.' This makes explicit the scope and nature of this 'world' by specifying it as a 'Sphere or Activity,' clarifying an astronomical concept that 'Monde' alone leaves more general.","Fontenelle's phrase 'si on se donne tant de peine' (if one gives oneself so much trouble) describes ambitious efforts generally. The English translation adds a specific list 'circumventing, betraying, flattering, and poorly lying' to exemplify these efforts, making explicit the morally negative means often implied but unstated by Fontenelle.","Fontenelle states that ambitious efforts stem from ignorance of the 'Tourbillons.' The English translation inserts the clause 'to grasp a part of a World they neither know nor understand' before this reason, making explicit the immediate, futile, and misunderstood terrestrial goal of such ambition, a detail implied by Fontenelle but not spelled out.","The French simply uses 'Alexandre.' The English translation 'Alexander the Great himself' makes explicit his common epithet 'the Great' and adds 'himself' for emphasis, clarifying the identity and stature of the historical figure for the reader.","The French 'Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau' (A little weakness for what is beautiful) is general. The English translation specifies this as 'a kind of Weakness in Love, a kind of frailty for what is delicate and handsom,' making the amorous nature of the philosopher's 'weakness' explicit.","Fontenelle lists physical attributes ('de beaux yeux, ou une belle bouche' – beautiful eyes, or a beautiful mouth) whose value endures. The English translation adds 'or make the Charms of Wit ever the less,' expanding the category of enduring qualities to include intellectual/social attributes, thereby explicating a broader scope of what retains value."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle, en riant; il se sauve de tout, &amp; il n'y a point de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Systême</span></span> qui luy puisse faire de mal.

By adding 'or Opinion,' the translator explicitly broadens the scope of 'Systême' to include systems of thought or belief, not just physical or scientific models, which was only implied in the original.","The French 'qu'elle ait ses Planetes qui tournent autour d'elle' (that it has its Planets that turn around it) is rendered as 'having Planets turning round it as that also has.' The addition of 'as that also has' explicitly draws a comparison to the Sun (previously mentioned as 'le Soleil'), making the analogy that the fixed star's planets are like the Sun's known planets more direct.","The French 'sont faits comme l'Amour' (are made like Love) is translated as 'is in some things near a-kin to Love.' The phrase 'in some things' is added by the translator, explicitly qualifying the comparison between mathematical reasoning and love, limiting its scope in a way that was only implicit in the original.","The French 'si peu de chose' (so small a thing / so little) in the context of an 'Amant' (Lover) is translated as 'the smallest Favour.' The word 'Favour' explicitly interprets 'si peu de chose' within a romantic or courtship context, making the nature of the 'small thing' granted to a lover more specific than the general French term.","The French 'cela va loin' (that goes far) is translated as 'prevails entirely.' The English translation makes the outcome of the lover's persistence more definitive and explicit ('prevails entirely') compared to the more open-ended or suggestive French phrase, which only implied a significant development.","The French phrase 'encore une autre' (yet another), referring to consequences drawn by a mathematician, is expanded to 'another, and then a third.' The addition 'and then a third' explicitly spells out the progression of logical steps, making the chain of reasoning more concretely illustrated than the original's open-ended 'encore une autre.'","The French 'qu'à peine le pouvez vous croire' (that you can scarcely believe it) is translated as 'that you cannot retreat.' The English version explicitly states the consequence of being led by mathematical reasoning as an inescapable commitment ('cannot retreat'), rather than the original's emphasis on the surprising nature of the conclusion.","The French 'Ces deux sortes de Gens-là' (Those two sorts of People) is translated as 'These two sorts of Men, The Lover and Philosopher.' The translator explicitly identifies 'The Lover and Philosopher,' who were the subjects of the preceding analogy, whereas the French refers to them implicitly through the demonstrative phrase.","The concise French 'je leur attribuë tout ce qu'il a' (I attribute to them all that it [our Sun] has) is expanded to 'I conclude they are Suns, and have Planets turning round about 'em; and every thing else we attribute to our Suns.' The translation explicitly lists key characteristics implied by 'tout ce qu'il a,' such as the fixed stars being 'Suns' themselves and having 'Planets turning round about 'em.'","The French 'il faut franchir le pas de bonne grâce' (one must take the step willingly/gracefully) is translated as 'and therefore you must generously yield.' The addition of 'therefore' explicitly links this statement as a consequence of being 'too far engag'd,' a connection that was sequential but not explicitly causal in the French. 'Yield' also makes the outcome of 'franchir le pas' more explicit in this argumentative context.","The French pronoun 'la leur' (theirs), implicitly referring to the light of other suns, is made explicit in the translation as 'the Light of the other Suns.' This clarifies the antecedent of the pronoun by fully naming what 'theirs' refers to.","The French '& il efface tout' (and it [the Sun] erases everything) is translated as 'his brightness makes all other things disappear.' The target text makes the implicit cause of the erasure explicit ('his brightness') and specifies 'tout' (everything) as 'all other things,' detailing the mechanism and scope more than the condensed source.","The French 'il efface à son tour le nôtre' (it in turn erases ours [our Sun]) is translated as 'he in his turn removes and darkens our Sun.' The single verb 'efface' (erases/blots out) is expanded into the more descriptive 'removes and darkens,' making the specific ways in which the other sun obscures ours more explicit.","The French impersonal construction 'On l'attache avec elles à cette grande voûte du Ciel, & il y fait partie de quelque Ourse, ou de quelque Taureau' (One attaches it... and it is part of some Bear or Bull) is rephrased as 'and our Sun appears to the Inhabitants of that Tourbillion in the great Vault of the Heavens, as a Star of some Constellation, such as the Bear or the Bull:'. This explicitation identifies the implicit agent 'On' as 'the Inhabitants' and clarifies that the Sun becomes 'a Star' when seen as part of a constellation from afar.","The French uses the impersonal pronoun 'on' twice: 'comme on ne les voit point de si loin, on n'y songe seulement pas' (as one does not see them from so far, one doesn't even think of it). The English translation replaces 'on' with 'they' ('since they cannot see it... they do not so much as think of it'), explicitly referring to 'the Inhabitants of that Tourbillion' (mentioned in the English translation of the preceding sentence), thereby making the agent of perception and thought explicit.","The French 'Soleils de nuit' (Suns of night) is translated as 'fix'd Stars by Night.' The translator replaces Fontenelle's more poetic and analogical term 'Suns of night' with the conventional astronomical term 'fix'd Stars,' thereby making explicit the scientific concept implied by the original phrasing.","The French 'ils ne servent qu'à faire nombre' (they only serve to make up a number/count among) is translated as 'but serve only to make up the Number of fix'd Stars for all the other Worlds.' The target text explicitly specifies *what* they make up the number of ('of fix'd Stars') and for whose perspective this applies ('for all the other Worlds'), adding details that were implied by the context but not directly stated in the concise French phrase."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P092: Assurément, repris-je, mais la difficulté est <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">de deviner</span></span>.

The English translation 'to find out those Differences' makes this implicit object explicit by adding the phrase 'those Differences,' thereby clarifying what the speaker finds difficult.","The French 'Icy' (Here), in a speculative list of possibilities about different cosmic vortices, implicitly refers to 'in one hypothetical vortex.' The English translation 'In one Tourbillion' makes this implicit referent explicit, clarifying that the description applies to a specific, albeit hypothetical, instance of a vortex being discussed.","The French 'l'équilibre qui les tient suspenduës' (the equilibrium that keeps them suspended) describes the force maintaining planets in their orbits in general terms. The English translation 'the Counterpoise which balances 'em' makes the nature of this force more specific by translating 'équilibre' (equilibrium/balance) as 'Counterpoise,' suggesting a particular kind of mechanical balancing force, thus making the scientific concept more concrete for the reader.","The French 'que voudriez-vous?' (what would you want?/what more could you ask?) is a rhetorical question.

The English translation \"What you have describ'd\" makes explicit the specific nature of his speech, clarifying that he has been providing descriptions and explanations, rather than just making general utterances. This adds a layer of specificity implied by the context of the ongoing scientific popularization.","The French phrase \"Ce n'en est guere\" (literally \"It is hardly any\" or \"That's not much\") conveys the Marquise's disagreement by stating the insufficiency of the philosopher's points.

The addition of \"in the Hemisphere\" explicitly clarifies the physical location of this \"whiteness\" as being in the celestial sphere, a detail implied by the astronomical context but not directly stated by Fontenelle.","The French \"petites Etoiles\" (little Stars) is translated as \"little fixed Stars\". The addition of the adjective \"fixed\" makes explicit the astronomical classification of these stars as understood in the 17th century, distinguishing them from \"wandering stars\" (planets). While the context of the Milky Way implies fixed stars, the translator spells out this scientific distinction.","The French \"d'un Monde à l'autre on pourroit se parler, ou même se donner la main\" (from one World to another one could speak, or even give each other a hand) implies interaction between inhabitants of different worlds. The target \"may converse and shake hands with those of their Neighbouring World;\" makes the other party in this interaction explicit by adding \"with those of their Neighbouring World,\" clarifying who is being spoken to or whose hand is being shaken.","The French clause \"un Soleil dans son Tourbillon efface dés qu'il paroît tous les Soleils étrangers\" (a Sun in its Vortex blots out as soon as it appears all foreign Suns) describes the sun's dominance. The corresponding target clause is \"the Sun, in his own Tourbillion, as soon as he begins to spread his Light, he faceth that of all other Stranger-Suns;\". Assuming \"faceth that of\" is intended to convey the meaning of \"efface\" (diminishes or outshines), the translator makes the *mechanism* of this action explicit. The phrase \"as soon as he begins to spread his Light\" is an addition that details *how* the sun's appearance causes the effect, whereas the original \"dés qu'il paroît\" (as soon as it appears) is less specific about this process.","The French \"force sur vos yeux\" (force/strength on your eyes) is translated as \"power, force, or influence upon your Eyes\". The translator expands the singular term \"force\" into the triplet \"power, force, or influence,\" thereby making more explicit the different facets of the sun's impact on vision (e.g., its intensity, its general effect). This expansion clarifies and amplifies the meaning of \"force\" in this context.","The French \"il vous en reste encore assez\" (there still remains enough of it for you) uses the pronoun \"en\" (of it), implicitly referring to light from the preceding context about suns and stars. The target translation \"you wou'd still have Light enough\" makes this implicit referent \"Light\" explicit, directly naming what remains.","The French \"clarté perpetuelle\" (perpetual brightness/light) is translated as \"perpetual Day\". \"Day\" is a more specific concept than \"clarté,\" as it refers to the period of illumination typically associated with a sun. The translator makes explicit that this perpetual light takes the form of a continuous day, rather than just abstract brightness.","The French \"des malheureux qui ont de veritables nuits\" (unfortunate ones who have real nights) is significantly expanded to \"several People in the Universe, who are under the Tribulation of dismal, real Nights\". The phrase \"several People in the Universe\" makes \"des malheureux\" (some unfortunates/unhappy people) more specific by adding a quantifier (\"several\") and explicitly stating their location (\"in the Universe\"). Furthermore, \"who are under the Tribulation of dismal, real Nights\" greatly elaborates on \"qui ont de veritables nuits\" (who have real nights) by adding \"under the Tribulation of,\" which introduces a strong connotation of suffering and religious hardship (resonant with the 1687 English context), and \"dismal,\" which explicitly characterizes the nights with a strong negative adjective. This re-writing intensifies the description of their plight.","The French \"des Etres disgraciez de la Nature\" (beings disgraced by Nature) is translated as \"such People as the Out-casts of Nature\". \"Out-casts\" is a more forceful and explicit interpretation of \"disgraciez\" (disgraced, fallen from favor), clearly framing these beings as rejected or expelled by Nature, not merely having lost its favor. The phrase \"such People\" also renders \"Etres\" (Beings) more concretely as human-like entities.","The French \"Ils... fremiroient de l'horreur de notre condition\" (They... would shudder with the horror of our condition) is rewritten as \"the very Thoughts of our sad Condition wou'd sieze them with Horrour.\" The translator makes the psychological cause of the horror explicit by changing the grammatical subject and agent of the sentence from \"They\" (Ils) to \"the very Thoughts of our sad Condition.\" This spells out that it is the contemplation of the condition, rather than the condition itself directly, that provokes horror. Additionally, \"notre condition\" (our condition) is rendered as \"our sad Condition,\" adding an explicit negative descriptor (\"sad\") not present in the original phrase."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P096: Je ne vous demande pas, dit la Marquise, s'il y a des Lunes dans les Mondes de la Voie de Lait; je voy bien qu'elles n'y seroient de nul usage aux Planetes principales qui n'ont point de nuit, &amp; qui d'ailleurs marchent dans des espaces trop étroits pour s'embarrasser de cet attirail de Planetes subalternes.

The translation first makes explicit the locus of the difficulty by adding \"to my Fancy,\" specifying the mental realm implied by \"me faites naître\" (make born for me). Secondly, and more substantially, the translator adds the clause \", which, I doubt, you will hardly satisfy:\", thereby making explicit a skeptical stance from the Marquise regarding the philosopher's ability to resolve the difficulty. This added clause voices a thought or reaction not present in the source text, altering the Marquise's expressed attitude and the dialogic dynamic.","The French \"tant de Boules\" (so many spheres/balls) implies a multiplicity of items. The translator makes the implicit characteristic of these items being distinct and individual explicit by adding the adjective \"different\" to \"Globes\" (the translation of \"Boules\"), thereby clarifying an attribute that was only implied in the source.","The French \"Je veux m'imaginer cela\" (I want to imagine that/I am trying to picture that) describes the Marquise's mental process of visualization. The English translation \"This I wou'd willingly understand\" makes explicit the intended cognitive goal of this visualization—namely, \"to understand\" the concept. In the context of popularizing science, imagining is often a means to comprehension, and the translation spells out this implied purpose of the mental effort."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P097: Il y a beaucoup d'esprit, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">répondis-je, à avoir cette difficulté-là</span></span>, &amp; même à ne la pouvoir résoudre; car elle est tres-bonne en soy, &amp; de la maniere dont vous la concevez, elle est sans réponse, &amp; c'est avoir bien peu d'esprit que de trouver des réponses à ce qui n'en a point.

The translator adds \"Madam,\" explicitly addressing the Marquise (who is implied as the interlocutor), and rephrases \"to have that difficulty\" as \"in *your proposing* of this Difficulty,\" which makes the Marquise's agency in raising the point and her direct ownership of the difficulty more explicit than the concise French.","The French \"six faces plates\" (six flat faces) is translated as \"six plain Superficies, or flat Sides\". The more formal \"Superficies\" is immediately clarified by the addition of \"or flat Sides,\" a more common and easily understood phrase. This explicitation ensures the reader grasps the geometric concept, enhancing accessibility.","The French \"Ces faces\" (These faces/surfaces), from the phrase \"Ces faces sont fort inégales\" and referring to the sides of the tourbillons, is translated as \"The flat Superficies\". Although the context of a die with \"faces plates\" (flat faces) earlier implies these subsequent \"faces\" are flat, the translator makes this characteristic explicit here by adding \"flat\" (and using the more formal \"Superficies\"). This consistently reinforces an attribute of the tourbillons' structure that was becoming more implicit in the original.","The French idiomatic expression \"la Nature qui ménage bien le terrain\" (literally \"manages the ground well,\" implying efficient use of space or resources) is translated by an expanded phrase: \"Nature, who will lose nothing, and turns all her work to the best advantage.\" The translator makes the implicit meaning of Nature's thriftiness and purposeful design explicit by fully spelling out the implications of this efficient management.","The French \"& ne laissent pas d'être un ou deux, ou mille Mondes de plus.\" (literally, \"and do not fail to be one or two, or a thousand more Worlds\") focuses on the result—more worlds. The English translation \"and yet every one of these may have a World in it;\" makes explicit the *mechanism* or *condition* by which these small tourbillons contribute to the count of worlds (i.e., by each potentially containing a world), clarifying an implied connection.","The French term \"Lunettes d'approche\" (literally \"approach glasses,\" a general term for optical instruments for viewing distant objects, such as spyglasses) is translated as \"Telescopes.\" In the context of observing \"petits Soleils\" (little Suns), \"Telescopes\" is the specific scientific instrument. The translator makes the implied specific astronomical instrument explicit, enhancing clarity for a work aimed at popularizing astronomy.","The French \"Ballon\" (which can mean a large ball or a balloon) is translated as \"Balloon, or Foot-ball.\" The addition of \"or Foot-ball\" provides a more concrete and perhaps more familiar example of an inflatable, resilient object for an English audience of the late 17th century. This explicitation clarifies Fontenelle's analogy about the expansive and compressive nature of worlds by offering an alternative image.","The French \"on pretendent que\" (using the indefinite pronoun \"on,\" meaning \"one/they claim/pretend that\") is rendered as \"the Philosophers pretend, that.\" The translator makes the agent of this claim explicit by specifying \"the Philosophers.\" While the general context of Fontenelle's work involves philosophical and scientific ideas, this direct attribution within the sentence is an addition by the translator, clarifying who is understood to be making this particular assertion."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort toutes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">ces Idées-là</span></span>, dit la Marquise.

The translator makes the pronominal reference more explicit by using the noun 'Traffick' (a contemporary synonym for the original French 'Commerce', which was the clear antecedent of 'le seul'), thereby spelling out the specific nature of 'the only one' that was concisely indicated by the pronoun in the source text.","The French phrase 'nous envoyent quelquefois visiter' literally means 'send [someone/something unspecified] to visit us sometimes'. The subject of who or what is sent to visit is implicit. The translation 'send Envoys sometimes to us' makes this implicit information explicit by specifying that 'Envoys' (official or diplomatic messengers) are sent. This adds a layer of specific meaning about the nature of these visitors that is not explicitly stated in the original French.","The French pronominal adverb 'en' in the clause 'Il nous en vient des Cometes' (Comets come to us from there/them) anaphorically indicates the origin of the comets as 'Les Mondes voisins' (the neighbouring Worlds) mentioned in the preceding sentence. The English translation 'We have Comets from thence too' renders 'en' as 'from thence.' This expands the highly condensed pronominal adverb 'en' into the more explicit adverbial phrase 'from thence,' thereby spelling out the locative source (from that place) more fully than the single French clitic.","The French 'une queüe majestueuse' (a majestic tail) is translated as 'a Royal Train.' The adjective 'majestueuse' (majestic, stately, grand) has connotations of royalty but is broader. The translator makes the regal aspect explicit and primary by using the specific word 'Royal.' Furthermore, the choice of 'Train' for 'queüe' (tail)—particularly in conjunction with 'Royal' and the preceding personifications of comets (having 'Hair' and 'Beard')—strongly evokes the image of a royal garment's train. This adds a specific visual interpretation and layer of meaning, particularizing the more general description found in the source text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P100: Ah! quels Deputez dit-elle en riant!

While 'enfants' can connote naivety, the addition of 'Fools' explicitly broadens the group frightened by comets to include not just children by age, but also foolish adults, making explicit a type of person not literally stated in the source.","The French 'les enfants' (children), as the implied subject of 'sont en grand nombre' (are in great number), refers to the previously mentioned children. The translation renders this group (previously identified by the translator as 'Fools and Children') as 'those Ignorants.' This explicitly attributes the characteristic of 'ignorance' to them, a judgment which is an interpretation and explicitation beyond the literal meaning of 'enfants.'","The French 'ses extremitez' (its extremities) is translated as 'the Extremity, or Out-side of it.' The addition of 'or Out-side of it' explicitly clarifies that 'extremities' refers to the outer boundary or external part of the tourbillon, making the spatial concept more concrete.","The French 'Ces Planetes' (These Planets) refers back to the comets, which were previously defined as a type of planet in the sentence 'Les Cometes ne sont que des Planetes'. The translator makes this established identity explicit by adding 'which we call Comets,' directly reminding the reader and reinforcing the connection.","The French 'qu'elles en coupent les extremitez.' (literally 'that they cut its extremities.') is translated as 'making their passage through the Extremity of it:'. The translation makes explicit the nature of the action 'couper' (to cut) in this context, clarifying that it means the comets pass through the extremities of the tourbillon, rather than severing them or intersecting them in a more abstract way.","The French 'sont-elles toûjours fort élevées à notre égard' (literally 'they are always very elevated with respect to us') is translated as 'they all appear to us highly elevated.' The phrase 'appear to us' makes explicit the observational or perceptual nature of their elevation. The French 'à notre égard' (from our perspective/in relation to us) implies this, but 'appear to us' directly states it involves perception.","The French 'elles marchent' (literally 'they walk' or 'they move'), describing the comets' movement, is rendered as 'their Course being.' The translation explicitly specifies that 'marchent' refers to the comets' orbital path or 'Course,' a more precise astronomical term, clarifying the general verb of motion used in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P101: J'entends, dit-elle..

Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles Fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumière; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">car que faire sans Soleil?</span></span> Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? Je vous diray, si vous voulez, répondis je, ce que disent de fort habiles Gens, que les Etoiles Fixes qui ont disparu ne sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est-à-dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mêmes, tantôt ils nous présentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantôt la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion-là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoître, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mêmes? Vous êtes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur.</span></span> Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles Fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantôt plus grandes tantôt plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus légers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur. Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement, des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoîtroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoître de longtemps. Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">la mort de Cesar</span></span>. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous.</span></span> Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses</span></span>; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">il faut que l'espce se repare.</span></span> Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature.

Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or false Light. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light? The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, and then farewell the Sun and all its Light. 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect. The Ancients were foolish to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience; but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener, but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is: Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever, yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? Eternity is not so easy a matter; and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish. Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them. If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other. Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie. 'Tis sufficient for me to have carried your Understanding as far as your sight can penetrate.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P074: I understand you, said she, and am pleas'd with your Chamber of State; for we do not permit 'em to come directly in the middle of our Tourbillion, but receive 'em as the Grand Seignior does his Foreign Ministers; he does 'em not the Honour to lodge 'em in Constantinople, but sends 'em to the Suburbs. Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">to frighten People</span></span>, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">a kind of Illumination, or false Light</span></span>. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">to frighten its Inhabitants</span></span>; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">meaning Saturn</span></span>; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage.</span></span> I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">for there is no living without a Sun.</span></span> That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist.

The addition of \"People\" specifies the object of the fear, which was implicit in the reflexive French construction, making the idea more concrete for the English reader.","The French \"une espèce d'illumination\" (a kind of illumination) is translated as \"a kind of Illumination, or false Light\". The addition of \"or false Light\" explicitly clarifies the nature of this illumination as being deceptive or merely apparent, reinforcing the earlier statement that the tails and beards are \"pures apparences\" (pure appearances).","The French \"y répandre l'effroy\" (to spread terror there) is translated as \"to frighten its Inhabitants\". The translator specifies \"its Inhabitants\" as the recipients of the fright, information that is implied by the context of planets and worlds but not explicitly stated in the French phrase.","The French \"disent-ils peut-être en parlant de Saturne\" (they say perhaps, speaking of Saturn) is rendered as \"meaning Saturn\". The translator removes the speculative \"peut-être\" (perhaps) and directly states that the planet being described is Saturn, thus making an identification explicit that Fontenelle presents as a likely but not definitively stated interpretation within the cometary inhabitants' speech.","The French \"comme ces Matelots qui crient, Terre, Terre..\" (like those Sailors who cry, Land, Land..) is translated as \"as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage.\" The phrase \"after a long Sea-Voyage\" is added by the translator to explicitly provide the common context for sailors shouting \"Land!\", which is only implied in the original.","The French rhetorical question \"car que faire sans Soleil?\" (for what is to be done without a Sun?) is translated as the declarative statement \"for there is no living without a Sun.\" The translator makes explicit the implied dire consequence of a sunless world, changing the rhetorical effect to a direct assertion.","The French \"cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur.\" (however I will make another effort in your favor/for your sake) is expanded to \"However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way:\". The translator makes explicit the nature of the \"effort\" (to solve this Objection another way) and rephrases \"en votre faveur\" as \"for your Satisfaction,\" clarifying the philosopher's intent and method.","The French \"la mort de Cesar\" (the death of Caesar) is translated as \"the Death of Iulius Caesar\". The translator makes the reference explicit by providing the full name \"Iulius Caesar,\" ensuring the reader correctly identifies the historical figure.","The French \"Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous.\" (The Ancients were young compared to us.) is translated as \"but the Ancients were young in respect of us.\" The addition of \"but\" explicitly links this statement as a contrasting explanation to the preceding rhetorical question about the Ancients' lack of experience, a connection that was juxtapositional and implicit in the French.","The French \"qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses\" (who lasts so long with respect to the Roses) is translated as \"who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses\". The translator makes the implicit scale of \"tant\" (so long/so much) more explicit by specifying \"so many Ages longer,\" giving a clearer measure to the gardener's longevity relative to the roses.","The French \"il faut que l'espce se repare.\" (the species must repair/renew itself) is significantly expanded to \"and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish.\" The translator makes explicit the idea that the disappearance of stars is a \"Defect in Nature\" that needs repairing, and further clarifies the underlying principle that \"no Species can totally perish,\" which are interpretations and expansions of the more concise French statement.","The French \"des herbes ou des plantes\" (herbs or plants) is translated as \"Herbs, Plants and Flowers\". The addition of \"Flowers\" makes the list of botanical examples more specific and evocative, slightly expanding on the general categories provided in the source.","The French \"qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage.\" (that it doesn't cost her more) is translated as \"since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other.\" The translator makes explicit what \"davantage\" (more) refers to by adding \"Pains and Expence,\" clarifying the nature of the \"cost\" to Nature.","The concise French \"n'en parlons plus\" (let's not speak of it anymore) is expanded to \"make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse\". The translator makes explicit that \"en\" (of it) refers to \"this subject\" and clarifies that it should no longer be \"that of our Discourse,\" adding a layer of formality and specificity.","The French uses the impersonal pronoun \"on\" in \"si on veut, ou être tels que l'on veut\" (if one wants, or be such as one wants). The translation \"as they themselves shall fansie.\" makes this agent explicit by specifying \"they themselves,\" clearly referring to the \"Philosophes\" mentioned in the same sentence. This changes the impersonal perspective of \"on veut\" to a specific one attributed to the philosophers and interprets \"veut\" (wants) as \"shall fansie\" (shall fancy/imagine)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">elle</span></span>, j'ay dans la tête <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">tout le systeme de l'Univers</span></span>!

The use of the plural 'Systemes' in the English translation explicitly suggests that the Marquise now comprehends multiple distinct components or sub-systems (such as various planetary systems or the detailed workings of celestial bodies) within the universe. This multiplicity was implied by the comprehensive scope of 'tout le systeme' in the French, but the pluralization in English makes this breadth of understanding more explicit.","The French phrase 'Oüy, répliquay-je' (Yes, I replied) is rendered in the translation as 'Yes, Madam'. The addition of 'Madam' is an explicitation, as it directly spells out the formal and polite mode of address used by the philosopher towards the Marquise. While this formality is implied by the overall context and use of 'vous' elsewhere in the French, the English translation makes this social aspect of their interaction explicit within the direct reply.","The French list of celestial objects 'le Soleil, ny le Ciel, ny les Etoiles' (the Sun, nor the Sky/Heaven, nor the Stars) is translated and expanded to 'the Heavens, Sun, Moon or Stars'. The translator has explicitly added 'Moon' to this list. The Moon was a significant subject of their discussions on the plurality of worlds throughout the book. Its inclusion here clarifies and makes more comprehensive the set of astronomical elements that should remind the Marquise of their conversations, adding information pertinent to their dialogue that was implied by the broader context but not specified in this particular list in the source text."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: FIN</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P076: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P076: FINIS.</p>","explanations":[]}],"counts":{"manual":23,"ai":589}}
