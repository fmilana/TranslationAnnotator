Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile,</span></span> elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit?</span></span> Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">&amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes.</span></span> Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">la plus belle nuit du monde</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">avec toute sa beauté brune.</span></span> Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je.</span></span> Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">favorise la resverie,</span></span> &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy?</span></span> Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde.</span></span> Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">Selon moy,</span></span> il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">donnez-la moy,</span></span> je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">Quoy donc,</span></span> reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, répliquai-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.</span></span> Cherchez ailleurs des Philosophes </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day. I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self. Well, says she, since your Folly is so delightful, pray let me have a share in it, I'l believe what you please of the Stars, provided I find pleasure in it. Ah! Madam, said I, 'tis not a pleasure like that which you find in a Comedy of Moliere; 'tis a pleasure, I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind. And pray, says she, do you think me incapable of pleasures that are only in the Reason; bring me acquainted with your Stars, and you shall presently see the contrary. No, said I, it shall never be laid to my charge, that in a Grove, at ten of clock at night, I entertain'd the most lovely person in the World with nothing but Philosophy, look out for such Philosophers elsewhere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">then</span></span></span></span> in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day.

The source \"donc un Soir\" (so one evening) doesn't explicitly contain this temporal marker; \"then\" emphasizes the specific time setting.","The translator added \"then\" to specify the moment the green appeared black (\"which then appeared black\"), enhancing temporal clarity for the reader where the source simply states \"qui paroissait noir\" (which appeared black).","The translator added \"us\" in \"rob us of\", personalizing the action of the cloud. The source \"qui dérobast\" (that stole/hid) doesn't specify *from whom* the star was hidden.","The translator added \"my Admiration\" to specify what was withdrawn from the Moon and Stars. The source says the narrator was not permitted \"de m'abandonner à\" (to abandon myself to) them; \"my Admiration\" makes the object of his mental state explicit.","The translator added \"clear\" to \"night\" (\"as a clear night\"), specifying the type of night. The source simply says \"une belle nuit\" (a beautiful night); \"clear\" likely draws from the earlier description of a cloudless sky.","The translator expanded \"vous qui ne l'estes pas\" (you who are not it [dark-haired]) by adding \"so little of it\" in the phrase \"who have so little of it in your self.\" This quantifies and emphasizes the degree to which the Marquise is not dark-haired, which is not explicit in the source's simple negation.","The translator added \"represented\" in \"are ever represented fair.\" The source states heroines \"sont presque toûjours blondes\" (are almost always blonde); \"represented\" clarifies that this is about their depiction in romances rather than an inherent state.","The translator rendered \"cette belle nuit\" (this beautiful night) as \"this so bright a night.\" The addition of \"so bright\" specifies the quality of the night's beauty, moving beyond the general term \"belle.\"","The translator rendered the singular \"toute sa beauté brune\" (all its dark beauty) as the plural \"all the dark beauties,\" thereby elaborating on the multifaceted nature of the night's charm by suggesting multiple distinct aspects.","The translator used \"most glorious\" to describe the night (\"the most glorious night\"), where the source has \"la plus belle nuit du monde\" (the most beautiful night in the world). \"Glorious\" adds a specific connotation of splendor and magnificence, intensifying the description.","The translator added the clause \"because it most obliges them.\" as an explicit reason for why the night receives thanks from lovers. The source text simply states that the night must have their thanks (\"Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements\"), without providing this justification.","The translator added \"our\" to \"Contemplation\" (in \"indulges our Contemplation\"). The source text refers to \"la resverie\" (reverie) in a general sense; \"our\" personalizes it to the observers/speaker.","The translator added the interjection \"How,\" at the beginning of the Marquise's question. The source text begins directly with \"Qu'appelez-vous...\" (What do you call...). This addition serves to express her surprise more emphatically.","The translator added \"Pray,\" before the question \"what folly is that?\". The source is \"Quelle est donc cette folie?\" (What then is this folly?). \"Pray\" is a discourse marker added for polite urging or inquiry, common in English of the period.","The translator added \"and 'tis this;\" after \"acknowledge it to you.\" The source text transitions directly from the apology (\"je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer\") to the explanation of the folly. This addition serves as a clearer marker introducing the content of the \"folly.\"","The translator added \"and truly,\" before \"in my opinion.\" The source text begins this thought with \"Selon moy\" (According to me / In my opinion), which is translated as \"in my opinion\". \"and truly\" is an emphatic addition not present in the original French.","The translator added \"pray\" before \"let me have a share in it.\" The source's \"donnez-la moy\" (give it to me) is a direct request. \"Pray\" softens the request and adds polite emphasis.","The translator used \"And pray,\" where the source has \"Quoy donc\" (What then / So what). \"And pray,\" is a conventional English phrase used to introduce an emphatic or earnest question, adding a layer of politeness or emphasis.","The translator added \"in the World\" to the description \"the most lovely person.\" The source text \"la plus aimable personne que je connoisse\" means \"the loveliest person I know.\" The addition \"in the World\" is a common English superlative intensifier, making the compliment grander."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière de Physique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; &amp; les Planètes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des mondes. J'en revenois toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes: &amp; si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir</span></span>, ce qui reviendrait au même. Mais on veut savoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyait bien, ce serait toujours autant de connu, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est.</span></span> Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voient point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toujours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opéra. Du lieu où vous êtes à l'Opéra, vous ne voyez pas le Théâtre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à votre veue ces roues &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvements. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guère de deviner comment tout cela joue. Il n'y a peut-être que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">qui s'inquiète d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire</span></span>, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a été exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui, à l'égard des Philosophes, augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature présente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">qu'on a été long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers</span></span>; car représentez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opéra, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Suposons qu'ils voyaient le Vol de Phaéton que les Vents enlèvent</span></span>, qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton. L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide; &amp; cent autres rêveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenue bien mécanique? Si mécanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bientôt honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvements régléz qui dépendent de l'arrangement des parties. Avouez la vérité. N'avez-vous pas eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne méritoit? J'ay vu des gens qui l'en estimoient moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoient connu. Et moy, répliqua-t'elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sais qu'il ressemble à une Montre. Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples. </p><p>P005: Je ne sais pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en vérité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la tête un faux Merveilleux envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent.</span></span> Ils n'admirent la Nature que parce qu'ils la croyent une espece de Magie où l'on n'entend rien; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">&amp; il est seur qu'une chose est deshonorée auprès d'eux, dés qu'elle peut être conceüe.</span></span> Mais, Madame, continuay-je, vous êtes si bien disposée à entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire, que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, &amp; à vous montrer le Monde.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected.

Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne &amp; menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil</span></span> quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus</span></span> qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien.</span></span> Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">et casseroient tout l'Univers</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">&amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide.</span></span> Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil</span></span>, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Nous lui donnons un petit dessein</span></span>, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">où elle s'estoit placée</span></span>, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué</span></span>, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">de tout cet équipage celeste</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner</span></span>, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">Et la Lune?</span></span> vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je.</span></span> La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle</span></span>, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry,</span></span> according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it.

The translator added \", Geometry and Poetry\" to the list of subjects the Marquise says she \"must keep close to.\" This alters her stated intention, possibly due to a misinterpretation of the French sentence structure or an attempt to link the subjects more directly before explaining why Geometry and Poetry are unsuitable for her. This constitutes an added proposition.","The translator added \"Almighty's\" to \"God's Council\" (source: \"son Conseil\" referring to God's). This is a common English epithet for God, likely added for cultural naturalness or to lend a slightly more formal or emphatic tone suitable for the context of the world's creation.","The translator added \"those\" and changed the source's \"deux ou trois\" (two or three) to a specific \"three\", rendering \"deux ou trois Cieux superflus\" as \"those three superfluous Heavens.\" This addition makes the number of superfluous heavens definite and specific, potentially to simplify the concept for the reader or reflect a common interpretation of the criticized cosmological model.","The translator added the idiomatic phrase \"ready at hand\" to the description of how philosophers posited new crystal heavens. The source \"c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal\" means \"it was immediately another Crystal Heaven.\" The addition of \"ready at hand\" emphasizes the ease and promptness of this invention, normalizing the expression into vivid English.","The translator added \"in those days\" to the statement about the cost of crystal heavens. The source \"Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien\" means \"In short, crystal heavens cost them nothing.\" The addition provides a clearer temporal context, emphasizing that this was a practice of a past philosophical era.","The translator rendered \"et casseroient tout l'Univers\" (and would break the whole Universe) as \"and break the World about our ears.\" The phrase \"about our ears\" is an English idiom not present in the source; it's an addition that dramatizes the consequence and makes it more vivid and relatable for the English audience through cultural normalization.","The source states \"& il a falu se resoudre\" (and it was necessary to resolve/decide). The translator rendered this as \"therefore it has been thought more convenient,\" adding the specific rationale of \"convenience\" for changing the heavens to a fluid matter, an explanatory gloss not explicit in the source.","The translator added \"and not about the Earth\" to the statement about Venus and Mercury. The source sentence \"que Venus & Mercure tournent autour du Soleil\" only states they \"move about the Sun.\" The addition explicitly clarifies the Copernican view in contrast to the Ptolemaic system, enhancing clarity for the reader.","The translator rendered \"un petit dessein\" (a small design) as \"a small inconsiderable Design.\" The word \"inconsiderable\" is an addition that intensifies the critique by adding a qualitative judgment about the design's lack of substance or importance, which is not explicitly lexicalized in the French \"petit\".","The translator elaborated \"où elle s'estoit placée\" (where it had placed itself/was placed) into \"where it had long been fixt.\" The addition of \"long been fixt\" emphasizes the historical duration and the perceived stability of Earth's central position in the old cosmological model, providing richer context for Copernicus's revolutionary change.","The translator added the adjective \"idle\" to \"long repos\" (long rest), resulting in \"long idle repose.\" This addition characterizes Earth's previous state not merely as rest, but as unproductive or unjustified rest, thereby enhancing the figurative, punitive aspect of Copernicus's model assigning motion to the Earth.","The translator rendered \"cet équipage celeste\" (this celestial equipage) as \"that bright Equipage.\" The adjective \"bright\" is an addition that makes an implied quality of celestial objects explicit, adding vividness to the imagery.","The translator rendered \"cette petite Terre\" (this little Earth) as \"this little spot of Earth.\" The addition of \"spot of\" is an idiomatic intensifier in English that more strongly emphasizes Earth's smallness and potential insignificance, possibly to contrast it with the grandeur of the universe or the lost \"equipage\".","The translator expanded the Marquise's elliptical French question \"Et la Lune?\" (And the Moon?) into the more complete English question \"And what... becomes of the Moon?\". This addition of \"what... becomes of\" provides a more natural, explicit, and contextually complete phrasing in English, a form of normalization for readability.","The translator added \"easy enough\" following \"I'l meet her again.\" The French source \"Je la retrouveray bien\" can imply ease or certainty (bien = well, indeed, easily). \"Easy enough\" makes the notion of ease explicit and adds a colloquial touch, normalizing the speaker's confident tone.","The translator specified \"daily\" in \"the Earth advances daily,\" where the source French \"avance toûjours\" means \"always advances\" or \"keeps advancing.\" The addition of \"daily\" introduces a specific frequency of Earth's movement not explicitly present in the original \"toûjours\".","The translator elaborated \"la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle\" (the Moon follows it, always turning around it) to \"the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth.\" The phrase \"in her daily course\" is an addition that specifies the manner and regularity of the Moon's movement, adding details not explicit in the source and echoing the previous addition of \"daily\" for Earth's movement."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient.

I know, says I, his design was to abate the Vanity of men who had thrust themselves into the chief place of the Universe, and I am very well pleased to see the Earth now in the common road of the other Planets. Very well, says she, do you think the Vanity of men extends to Astronomy? or that I am more troubled because I understand that the Earth moves about the Sun? I profess, I do not at all esteem my self less.

Truly, said I, Copernicus himself was very diffident of the success of his Opinion, and was long before he would publish it; at last he was persuaded, but the day that the first printed Copy of his Book was brought to him, do you know what he did? Faith he died; He had no mind to withstand all the Contradiction he knew it would meet with, and therefore wisely withdrew. But hark you, said the Marchioness, we must do justice to all the World: it is certainly very difficult to believe that we turn; for I cannot see that we change place, and we find our selves in the morning where we lay down at night. I find, methinks, in your face that you are going to tell me, that as the whole body of the Earth moves-Most true, said I, interrupting her, 'tis the same thing as if you slept upon the River in a Boat, you would find your self at waking in the same place and same scituation in respect of the parts of the Boat. Allow'd, says she, but here's the difference, I should find at waking the Banks of the River chang'd, and from thence I should find that my Boat had chang'd place. But 'tis not so with the Earth, I find all things there just as I left them. No, no, Madam, said I, the Banks change also. You know that beyond all those Circles of the Planets are the fixed Stars, those are our Banks. I am upon the Earth, and the Earth describes a great Circle about the Sun. I look towards the center of that Circle, and see there the Sun: if the Stars were then to be seen, in looking on in a straight line beyond the Sun, I must needs see which of the fixed Stars answer'd to him; but I easily see in the night, which of the Stars answer'd to him in the day, which is exactly the same thing. If the Earth did not change place in the Circle where she is, I should see the Sun every day answering the same fixed Stars; but since she changes place, I must needs find him answer to others. There's the Bank that changes every day, and as the Earth performs her Circle in one year, I see the Sun in the space of one year answer a whole Circle of fixed Stars. That Circle is call'd the Zodiack; if you please, Ile draw you a Figure here in the dust. No, no, says she, I shall do well enough without it: besides it will give my Park an Air of Philosophy, which I have no mind to.

But 'tis not so with the Earth, I find all things there just as I left them. No, no, Madam, said I, the Banks change also. You know that beyond all those Circles of the Planets are the fixed Stars, those are our Banks. I am upon the Earth, and the Earth describes a great Circle about the Sun. I look towards the center of that Circle, and see there the Sun: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">if the Stars were then to be seen</span></span>, in looking on in a straight line beyond the Sun, I must needs see which of the fixed Stars answer'd to him; but I easily see in the night, which of the Stars answer'd to him in the day, which is exactly the same thing. If the Earth did not change place in the Circle where she is, I should see the Sun <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">every day</span></span> answering the same fixed Stars; but since she changes place, I must needs find him answer to others. There's the Bank that changes every day, and as the Earth performs her Circle in one year, I see the Sun in the space of one year answer a whole Circle of fixed Stars. That Circle is call'd the Zodiack; if you please, Ile draw you a Figure here in the dust. No, no, says she, I shall do well enough without it: besides it will give my Park an Air of Philosophy, which I have no mind to.

The source 'Il mourut' (He died) is a straightforward statement, while 'Faith' adds a colloquial and emphatic tone to the narration.","The translator added 'But' before 'hark you' (which translates 'Ecoutez'). While 'Ecoutez' (Listen) can introduce a point, 'But' adds a specific adversative or stronger transitional nuance not explicitly in the source.","The translator used 'Allow'd' for the source's 'Oüi' (Yes). 'Allow'd' implies a more formal or considered concession of the previous point before introducing a counter-argument, a stronger nuance than the simple 'Oüi'.","The source 'S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles' (If it [the Sun] did not erase/blot out the Stars) is rendered as 'if the Stars were then to be seen'.

The source 'je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre...' (I would always see the Sun answer...) implies continuous or repeated observation, but 'every day' makes this temporal aspect more concrete.","The source has a single 'Non' (No). The translator rendered this as 'No, no,', adding the second 'no' for emphasis or to reflect a more natural English conversational style in expressing refusal.","The source 'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là' means 'it is not fitting for me to make such steps' or 'it is not my place to'. The translation 'it is not for my credit to make such steps here' adds a specific social motivation (concern for her 'credit' or reputation) not explicitly present in the source, thus elaborating on her reluctance.","The source 'car enfin on ne change point de place' (for after all, one/we do not change place) is an objective-sounding statement. The target 'for I cannot see that we change place' adds the subjective qualifier 'I cannot see that', explicitly grounding her argument in her personal perception, an elaboration not directly in the French impersonal construction."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs.

This addition makes the contrast with Circassian husbands clearer by specifying the location of the husbands being discussed.","The translator rendered 'toute la Coque de Ver à soye' (the whole silkworm cocoon) as part of the phrase 'all the other Cod of the Silkworm'. The addition of 'other' changes the sense from a single, exemplary cocoon in the analogy to a broader reference to additional, different cocoons, expanding the scope of the comparison.","The translator expanded 'de si grands Travaux' (such great Works/Labors) into 'that we labour and toil.' The addition of 'and toil' elaborates on 'labour,' emphasizing the arduous nature of the efforts, a common rhetorical device (hendiadys) in English of the period.","The translator added 'as we do' to the phrase 'make such a noise on all hands.' This personalizes the impersonal French 'il règne... une si grande agitation' (a great agitation reigns), directly attributing the cause of the agitation to human actions ('we').","The translator added 'fully' to 'we are not fully assur'd,' intensifying the Marquise's doubt. The source 'on n'est pas assuré' (one is not assured) is made more emphatic.","The translator rendered 'me sont suspectes' (are suspicious to me) as 'I am ... very doubtful' and added 'still' ('I am still very doubtful'). This addition emphasizes the persistence of the Marquise's skepticism despite previous explanations.","The translator added 'or other' after 'some little mark,' making the phrasing more idiomatic and slightly vaguer in English, a common way to express an indefinite item of a category.","The translator added 'it self' after 'Morality' ('even in Morality it self') for rhetorical emphasis, strengthening the assertion about the truth applying to morality.","The translator added 'at all' to 'we are not at all sensible of it,' intensifying the negation in 'nous ne le sentons pas' (we do not feel it/are not sensible of it) to mean a complete lack of sensation.","The translator rendered 'Physique' as 'Natural Philosophy' by adding 'Natural.' This provides cultural and historical context, as 'Physique' in Fontenelle's time often corresponded to the broader English term 'Natural Philosophy' (the study of nature) rather than modern, narrower 'Physics.'","The translator added 'now' to 'Let us now retire.' While 'Retirons-nous' means 'Let us retire,' the addition of 'now' gives the suggestion more immediacy, which is a common feature in English dialogue."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: En retournant au Château je luy dis pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Tycho Brahé</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fût immobile</span></span>, la plaçoit au centre du Monde, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planètes, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planètes autour de la Terre</span></span>.

This specifies that 'a third' refers to a type or kind of system, enhancing clarity for the English reader where the French 'un troisiéme' (a third one) is more elliptical in this context.","The translator added 'of opinion' to the description of Tycho Brahe's stance. The source 'qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fût immobile' (who, absolutely wanting/insisting the Earth be immobile) is rendered as 'who being absolutely of opinion that the Earth was immovable'. The addition of 'of opinion' elaborates on the nature of Brahe's conviction, making explicit that his insistence stemmed from a held belief.","The translator added 'left' to the phrase 'there was no way'. The source 'il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planètes autour de la Terre' (there was no way to make the Planets turn about the Earth) is rendered as 'there was no way left to make the Planets turn about the Earth'.

The translator adds 'by the Custom in' before 'the Country' to explicitly clarify that it is a prevailing social norm or custom, rather than the physical place, that grants this right, thus providing context for the reader.","The source text refers to 'pousser leur visite' (to extend their visit, singular), implying the extension of the specific, current visit. The target text's 'continue their Visits' (plural) broadens this to suggest a general right applicable to multiple visits or the act of visiting in general, which elaborates on the scope of the 'Custom'.","The source text states that the visitors 'eurent l'honnêteté de ne le pas faire' (had the decency/honesty not to do it – i.e., not to extend their visit). The target text's addition 'as to be gone' elaborates on this by making explicit the action (departing) that resulted from their decency, providing clarity for the reader.","The translator added 'Truly,' at the beginning of the Marquise's speech. This adverb is not a direct translation of any specific word in the corresponding French sentence (which begins 'Je n'ay pourtant jamais oüy parler...') and serves to add a conversational emphasis or a tone of genuine surprise or sincerity to her statement for the English reader.","The source phrase 'qu'on a des ménagemens avec ses Ennemis mêmes' (that one has dealings/shows consideration for one's very Enemies) implies careful, diplomatic, or prudent handling. The target phrase 'maintain an Intrigue with' introduces a more specific and potentially more clandestine connotation of secret plotting or complex maneuvering, which elaborates on and narrows the broader meaning of 'avoir des ménagemens'."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P022: Suposons qu'il n'y ait jamais eu nul commerce entre Paris &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Saint-Denis</span></span>, &amp; qu'un Bourgeois de Paris, qui ne sera jamais sorty de sa Ville, soit sur les Tours de Notre Dame, &amp; voye Saint-Denis de loin; on luy demandera s'il croit que Saint-Denis soit habité comme Paris.

The translator adds 'I prove that', introducing the speaker's agency ('I') and the act of 'proving' as the condition, which is not present in the source's more impersonal or event-based condition.","The source 'vous voilà dans l'obligation de croire' means 'you are then obliged to believe'. The adverb 'downright' is an addition by the translator that intensifies the statement of obligation for the English reader, adding a degree of forcefulness not explicit in the original.","The source 'je vous vois un air de confiance' means 'I see in you an air of confidence' or 'I see an air of confidence about you'. The translator adds the phrase 'in your looks' to specify the particular way or physical manifestation through which this confidence is observed, providing a concrete detail not present in the more general source statement.","The source 'qui me fait déjà peur' translates to 'that already makes me afraid' or 'that is already scaring me', where 'déjà' (already) indicates the existing state of fear. The translator replaces this temporal aspect by adding 'half', which specifies the *degree* of fear ('half afraid'). This introduces a specific quantification of emotion not present in the source.","The source phrase 'dont je ne me fusse jamais doutée,' (of which I would never have suspected/doubted) expresses a past hypothetical state reflecting prior unawareness or that the idea was inconceivable. The target phrase 'of which I shall never make any doubt' introduces a new proposition not present in the source: a conscious and firm assertion of future, unwavering belief regarding the two motions of the Earth. This addition changes the Marquise's expressed sentiment from past incredulity/unawareness to a future resolve.","The source 'pour leur ressemblance' means 'for their resemblance.' The translator adds the verbal phrase 'to make up,' which elaborates the purpose by suggesting an action of constituting or completing the resemblance. This adds a nuance of active formation that is not explicit in the simpler prepositional phrase of the source.","The source 'n'éclairent que parce qu'elles sont éclairées de luy' (shine only because / do not shine except because they are illuminated by him) is rephrased. The translator introduces the explicit negative statement 'give no Light' and then uses 'but as' (except in the manner that/except when). The source combines the negation and condition more compactly. This restructuring by adding 'give no Light, but as' provides a more analytical or emphatic phrasing for the English reader.","The source phrase 'il faut que ... aussi' (it is necessary that ... also / it must also be that...) within the clause is rendered as 'it must needs be likewise'. The addition of 'needs' (an archaic intensifier for 'must') and 'likewise' (a more formal and explicit rendering of 'aussi' or 'in the same way') elaborates the source expression, adding emphasis and a slightly more formal tone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere du Soleil?

'Spherical' is a more precise scientific term than simply 'round', elaborating on the nature of the celestial bodies and normalizing the language for an astronomical context.","The translator added 'daily' to the description of the sun's illumination. The source states the sun 'toûjours' (always) enlightens a an half of the planets; 'daily' elaborates on this by specifying the cyclical frequency (every day) of this constant illumination as it results in day and night, adding clearer temporal context not explicitly in 'toûjours'.","The translator added 'then' to the phrase 'where it is day' (describing parts of the Moon). This addition clarifies that it refers to 'at that particular moment' when those parts experience day, making the temporal reference more explicit than the source's simple 'qui ont le jour' (which have day).","The translator added 'then' to the statement of the Moon's position ('she is then between the Sun and us'). The source 'c'est qu'elle est entre le Soleil & nous' (it is that she is / because she is between the Sun and us) states a fact or reason. 'Then' in the target establishes a clearer consequential and temporal link to the preceding condition ('In the first days of a month').","The source phrase '& nous sommes en Décours pour elles' means 'and we (the Earth) are in a waning phase for them (the Moon's inhabitants)'.

Were there none but you, Madam, said I, all those that have been address'd to you, are fled thither, and they are enough to make a considerable body. In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it. But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon. They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable. When we go to some Lands newly discover'd, we find the Inhabitants scarce Men; they are a sort of Animals in humane shape, and sometime imperfect enough, but almost wholly without reason: therefore surely he that should go on to the Moon, would not find them Men at all.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P030: As for the Sighs of Lovers, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, I know not whether in the days of Ariosto they were lost or not, but now adays I know none that go to the Moon.

But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon. They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">unless the Phiol be close stop'd</span></span>, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest,</span></span> and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey,</span></span> and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Is not his pretty?</span></span> For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not</span></span></span></span>; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">in the distance between this and China</span></span></span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">and certainly <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">in such a distance as between this and the Moon</span></span>, the change ought to be much more considerable.</span></span> When we go to some Lands newly discover'd, we find the Inhabitants scarce Men; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">they are a sort of Animals in humane shape</span></span>, and sometime imperfect enough, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">but almost wholly without reason:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">therefore surely he that should go on to the Moon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">would not find them Men at all.</span></span></span></span></p>","explanations":["The translator rendered 'si elle n'est enfermée' (if it is not enclosed/shut) as 'unless the Phiol be close stop'd'. The phrase 'close stop'd' (closely stoppered) is more specific than 'enfermée,' providing a clearer image of how the phial containing volatile liquid is sealed, which is added for clarity.","The translator added 'there' to explicitly state the location (the Moon) where Astolfo found his phial. While implied in the French context from the preceding narrative, adding 'there' makes the location explicit within this specific clause, enhancing clarity for the English reader.","The translator added 'However' at the beginning of the sentence to create a contrasting transition or to mark a return to the main topic (Roland's phial) after a brief digression about Astolfo's own folly. This conjunction is not present in the source and aids the narrative flow.","The translator used 'his' (presumably referring to Ariosto's preceding verses and style) to make the referent of the French demonstrative 'Cela' (That/This) more specific. This addition clarifies for the English reader what the 'pretty' thing is.","The translator added 'pray' before 'tell me.' 'Pray' is a common English marker of politeness or earnest entreaty, used here to emphasize the Marquise's strong desire for a serious and direct answer.","The translator added 'or not' to complete the structure of the indirect yes/no question in English ('whether...or not'). This is a common way to normalize French 'si' (if/whether) clauses that introduce such questions, making the question form more explicit.","The translator added 'Do but' before 'observe' (for the French 'Voyez'). This construction ('do but' + verb) serves to create an emphatic imperative, intensifying the command and adding a somewhat formal or archaic emphasis, common in English prose of the period.","The translator added 'in the distance between' when rendering 'd'icy à la Chine' (from here to China). This elaboration makes the concept of geographical span more explicit and perhaps more formal than the concise French original.","The translator introduced 'you find' before the list of observed differences. The French source directly lists these items ('d'autres Visages...'). The addition of 'you find' personalizes the observation (using 'you' as a general pronoun) and provides an explicit subject and verb phrase, adhering to common English sentence structure and potentially enhancing direct engagement with the reader.","The translator added 'and certainly' at the beginning of the sentence. The 'and' serves as a coordinating conjunction to link with the previous idea, and 'certainly' adds a degree of assertive emphasis or conviction to the statement, which is not explicitly marked by such an adverb at the start of the corresponding French sentence.","The translator expanded the concise French 'D'icy à la Lune' (From here to the Moon) by adding 'in such a distance as between'. This elaboration emphasizes the vastness and nature of the distance being discussed, providing additional context and framing for the comparison.","The translator inserted 'a sort of' before 'Animals'. This addition qualifies the term 'Animals', suggesting that the beings encountered are not typical animals but rather a specific kind or category, particularly beings 'in humane shape' but imperfect. It adds a nuance of classification.","The translator added 'wholly' to the phrase 'almost without reason'. The source 'presque sans aucune raison humaine' means 'almost without any human reason'. The addition of 'wholly' intensifies 'almost', emphasizing the near-complete absence of reason for rhetorical effect.","The translator added 'therefore' at the beginning of the sentence. This explicitly marks the sentence as a logical conclusion derived from the preceding arguments. While the French 'assurément' (translated as 'surely') conveys certainty, 'therefore' adds a specific logical connector that is not present at the start of the French sentence structure.","The translator added 'at all' to intensify the negation 'would not find them Men'. This is a common English colloquialism used for emphasis, making the denial more absolute and rhetorically stronger than the French 'ce ne seroient plus des Hommes' (they would no longer be Men)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience?

Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Loin de connoître les Sciences</span></span>, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots.

If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">I'le prove it to you</span></span>. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there.

If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd.

I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth.

'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">they were as often put to swim to recover it</span></span>; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them</span></span>, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">the great surprize of the Americans</span></span>, but certainly never any equall'd it.

The phrase 'strangers to knowledge' introduces a vivid metaphor and an intensification ('so great') not present in the more straightforward source, thereby adding a layer of figurative meaning.","The source states they had to swim 'aussi-tôt' (immediately) after the boat capsized. The target rephrases this clause to 'they were as often put to swim', explicitly linking the frequency of swimming ('as often') to the previously mentioned frequency of the boat capsizing ('often subject to overset'). This specific linking through frequency is an addition.","The source 'voilà un beau jour' (one fine day) is an impersonal indication of time. The target substitutes this with 'Yet you see the time came,' adding a direct address to the reader ('you see') and a more narrative framing ('the time came'), which are elaborations on the source's simpler temporal marker.","The source refers to 'la surprise des Américains' (the surprise of the Americans). The target translates this as 'the great surprize of the Americans,' adding the adjective 'great' to intensify the emotion, making the magnitude of the surprise more explicit.","The source asks if the Americans would have believed in commerce with Europe, 'qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas?' (which they didn't even know [existed]?). The target rephrases and adds the clause 'and that they alone should not know it?', introducing the idea of the Americans reflecting on their unique state of ignorance ('they alone'), a specific notion absent from the source.","The source says Americans 'n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins...' (were far from suspecting that one could make paths...). The target renders the dependent clause as 'that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not.' The phrase 'whether... or not' introduces an explicit consideration of alternatives (passable or not passable) that the Americans supposedly 'never minded,' which is an elaboration on simply not suspecting passage was possible.","The source 'il y avoit bien loin' (it was a long way) describes the gap. The target translates this as 'There was a great distance or difference'. The addition of 'or difference' explicitly offers an alternative or complementary interpretation of 'bien loin,' clarifying that the gap is qualitative ('difference') as well as developmental ('distance').","The source 'il se perfectionnera' (it will be perfected / it will perfect itself). The target 'it will daily grow towards perfection' adds the adverb 'daily,' specifying a continuous, day-by-day progression of improvement, an aspect of timing not present in the source, and also uses 'grow towards' instead of a more direct 'be perfected'.","The source states a direct comparison: 'nous serons comme les Americains...' (we will be like the Americans...). The target rephrases this by introducing an analogy with 'just so the Americans could not dream...'. The element 'just so' along with the recasting of the sentence transforms the direct comparison into an illustrative analogy, clarifying the rhetorical function of the example.","The source 'jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean' means 'to the point of being able to cross the Ocean.' The target's 'as to venture to pass the Ocean' adds the verb 'venture,' introducing the connotation of risk, courage, or boldness in undertaking the crossing, an element not explicitly present in 'pouvoir' (to be able to).","The source 'En suite' (Next, Then) simply indicates sequence. The target uses 'So likewise it was thought...', where 'So likewise' is an added cohesive device. This explicitly signals a logical connection of similarity or analogy with the preceding argument, thus structuring the discourse more overtly for the reader.","The source 'on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune' means 'one will know as far as the Moon.' The target 'we shall know all as far as the Moon' adds the word 'all,' implying a totality or comprehensiveness of knowledge up to that point, an intensification not explicitly present in the source.","The source 'aller me coucher tranquillement' means 'to go to bed calmly/peacefully.' The target 'to go to bed and sleep quietly' explicitly adds 'and sleep,' making the intended activity (sleeping) and its peaceful nature more specific, whereas the source only mentions the act of going to bed."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.

The French source \"Nous ne manquâmes pas à aller le soir\" translates to \"We did not fail to go in the evening\". The addition of \"then\" serves as a discourse marker, possibly to enhance narrative flow or to connect this clause more explicitly to the preceding context, which is not directly mirrored in the source text's structure.","The French phrase \"à aller ... dans le Parc\" (to go ... into the Park) is rendered as \"to take our Walk into the Park\". The translator added \"our Walk\", elaborating on the general verb of motion \"aller\" (to go) by specifying the activity. While walking is implied by the context of the book, the source text here does not explicitly state it, making \"our Walk\" an added detail for clarity or idiomatic expression.","The translator added the word \"now\" to the phrase \"was now become\". The French source \"qui devenoit\" (which was becoming/became) indicates a process or a state that had come to be. The addition of \"now\" explicitly situates the resultant state in the narrative's present moment, providing more temporal explicitness than the French imperfect tense alone might convey to an English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences êtoit habitée, pourroit bien ne l'être point; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril. Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois</span></span>, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voilà le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune; conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance. Cela nous fournira des fruits, des blés, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons. J'entends des fruits, des bleds, des eaux à la maniere de la Lune que je fais profession de ne pas connoître, le tout proportionné aux besoins de ses Habitans, que je ne connais pas non plus.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P036: I have News to tell you, said I. The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not. From the moment that we have an interior motion in the parts of the Moon, or produc'd found by foreign causes, the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd, and we have a fund necessary for their subsistance. This will furnish us with Fruit, Corn, Water, and all that we desire. I mean Fruit, Corn and Water, such as are in the Moon; for I profess not to know of what sort they are, all fit for the use of the Inhabitants, whom I know as little.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P036: I have News to tell you, said I.

Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not. From the moment that we have an interior motion in the parts of the Moon, or produc'd found by foreign causes, the Inhabitants of the Moon are restor'd, and we have a fund necessary for their subsistance. This will furnish us with Fruit, Corn, Water, and all that we desire. I mean Fruit, Corn and Water, such as are in the Moon; for I profess not to know of what sort they are, all fit for the use of the Inhabitants, whom I know as little.</p>","explanations":["The translator added 'of doing so' to make the object of 'the difficulty' more explicit.

The source implies this connection through juxtaposition, but 'likewise' makes it explicit, aiding coherence for the target audience.","The source states Alexander saw Earth as a place 'bien propre à y établir un grand Empire' (very suitable for establishing a great Empire there). The translator added 'the Seat of', elaborating that it was 'fit for the Seat of a great Empire'. This specifies the nature of the establishment as the central place of rule, a contextual detail not explicitly present in the source, thereby adding a more concrete image for clarity.","The source refers to 'le sejour d'Astrée' (the abode of Astrée). The translator added 'his' before Astrée, rendering it as 'the abode of his Astrea'. This addition personalizes the reference, emphasizing Celadon's romantic connection to Astrée, a key aspect of his character from the 17th-century novel 'L'Astrée,' thus providing cultural context and clarity for readers potentially unfamiliar with the literary allusion.","The source states the Philosopher 'la voit comme une grosse Planète' (sees it as a large Planet). The translator added 'only' ('sees it only as a great Planet'), making the philosopher's view exclusive. This addition creates a parallel with Celadon's perspective ('ne la voyoit que comme' - saw it only as), which does have an explicit marker of exclusivity in the source, thereby imposing a similar restrictive emphasis on the philosopher's view that is not in the original French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P047: Le changement de spectacle est plus surprenant dans nos imaginations, répliquay-je, car ce ne sont que les mêmes objets qu'on voit si diferemment; du moins dans la Lune on peut voir d'autres objets, ou ne pas voir quelques-uns de ceux qu'on voit icy.

This specifies that faces are actively created or shaped according to the model, a nuance not explicit in the source's simpler verb 'sont' (are).","The translator expanded 'un même modele' (a single model/the same model) to the emphatic English idiom 'one and the same model'. This addition strongly underscores that all faces initially conform to a single, identical template.","The translator rendered 'pour varier en tant de manieres' (to vary in so many ways) as 'in framing such variety'. The verb 'framing' (implying constructing or shaping) elaborates on 'varier' (to vary), and 'such variety' is a more concrete nominalization of 'en tant de manieres', making the diversification process seem more active and structured.","The translator added 'only' to the translation of 'une chose' (a thing), resulting in 'one only thing'.

The translator renders this by recasting the opening to ''Tis most certain that...'. The addition of 'most certain' significantly elevates the degree of certainty compared to the more cautious French term, adding an assertion of definitiveness not directly present in the original 'Apparemment'.","Similar to the first instance, 'apparemment' (apparently) from the French source is translated as 'doubtless' in the target text. This substitution adds a strong sense of conviction or certainty that is not conveyed by the French original, which is more speculative.","The translator has added the interjection 'Nay,' before 'perhaps' in the target text. The French source 'Peut-être même y a-t-il...' (Perhaps even there are...) does not contain a direct equivalent for 'Nay,'. This addition serves as an English discourse marker to emphatically introduce or elaborate on the subsequent point.","The French noun 'bornes' (which can mean bounds, limits, or boundaries) is rendered in the target text as the doublet 'bounds and limits'. The explicit addition of 'and limits' is a common English stylistic device (a form of hendiadys or pleonasm) used for emphasis or to ensure full semantic coverage by pairing near-synonyms, thereby adding lexical material not strictly present in the singular French term.","The French text states 'où quelque chose de ce que nous savons est inconnu' (where something that we know is unknown). The translator inserts 'likewise' in the target text ('where likewise something...'), which explicitly adds an adverbial link of similarity or addition. This adverb is not present in the French and serves to make the connection between this clause and the preceding idea more overt for the English reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Etes-vous contente</span></span>, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux?

The source \"Mon imagination travaille\" (My imagination works/is working) is present tense. The addition of \"now\" makes the current, ongoing nature of the Marquise's imaginative activity more explicit, possibly for emphasis or to align with her preceding use of \"presentement\" (now).","The translator added \"well\" to \"I cannot describe them\". The source \"Je ne vous les pourrois pas décrire\" (I could not describe them to you / I would not be able to describe them to you) suggests an inability. \"I cannot well describe them\" nuances this by implying some ability to describe, but not adequately or proficiently. This addition might be for idiomatic English expression or to subtly alter the nature of the stated inability.","The translator added \"in it\" to the clause \"whether they assisted you well\". The source \"s'ils vous auront bien servie\" (if they will have served you well) lacks this explicit anaphoric reference. \"in it\" likely refers to the task of imagining the figures of planetary inhabitants, as discussed previously. This addition enhances cohesion and clarity for the English reader by specifying the context of the assistance.","The translator rendered \"comment sont faits les Habitants\" (how the inhabitants are made/what they are like) as \"inform'd you of the Shape of the Inhabitants\". The addition of \"of the Shape\" specifies and narrows the broader meaning of the source phrase. This makes the type of information expected from the dreams more concrete and visual, potentially for clarity or to guide the reader's imagination primarily towards physical appearance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P054: QUATRIEME SOIR.

The translator adds \"Our\" to specify that these are the dreams involving the narrator (and possibly the Marchioness), providing contextual clarity for the English reader where the source is more general or ambiguous.","The translator adds \"still\" to the phrase \"to be ignorant.\" The French \"ignorer\" means \"to not know\" or \"to be ignorant of.\" The addition of \"still\" emphasizes the continuing state of their ignorance, a nuance not explicitly present in the source.","The French source uses \"Come...\" (\"As/Since...\") at the beginning of the sentence to establish a causal relationship. The translator restructures the sentence and inserts \"therefore\" to explicitly mark the logical consequence, which enhances clarity and aligns with common English sentence patterns for expressing cause and effect.","The French phrase \"à peu prés\" translates to \"approximately\" or \"nearly.\" The translator uses \"very near about,\" where \"very\" is an added intensifier not explicitly present in the source. This addition serves to emphasize the closeness of the approximation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P056: Vous m'affligez, dit la Marquise.

The source text's description of the planet as \"jolie\" (pretty/charming) does not explicitly state its size. This addition likely reinforces the contrast with Earth (which the Marquise described earlier as \"trop grande\" for such romantic roles) and better aligns the planet's image with the delicate nature implied by romantic names like \"Star of Shepherds,\" thus clarifying this ideal attribute for English readers.","The translator used \"brisk\" to describe the planet, where the source text has \"jolie\" (pretty/charming). The quality of being \"brisk\" (active, lively) is a new characteristic not conveyed by \"jolie.\" This introduces a different, perhaps more dynamic, nuance to the planet's description for the English audience, possibly to complement its \"gallant Air\" also mentioned in the sentence.","The translator rendered the French \"valent\" (are worth/are equal to) as \"is beyond.\" The use of \"beyond\" introduces a distinct concept of superiority—that the Venusians' conversations surpass those of Clelia—which is not present in the source's notion of equivalence. This elaboration enhances the level of sophistication attributed to the inhabitants of Venus for the target audience.","The translator used \"polite\" to describe Clelia's conversations, where the source text has \"belles\" (beautiful). \"Polite\" is a more specific characteristic than the general term \"beautiful.\" This specification adds a contextual detail about the nature of these exemplary conversations, potentially to make the comparison more concrete for English readers within the broader theme of gallantry.","The source states Venus receives \"une lumiere plus vive & plus de chaleur\" (a more vivid light and more heat). The translation \"a Light more lively and hot\" makes \"hot\" an adjective directly qualifying \"Light.\" This effectively adds the proposition that the light itself is hot, whereas the source describes Venus receiving \"more heat\" as a separate, albeit related, entity alongside \"vivid light.\" This alteration of the physical description might be for stylistic conciseness or to create a more intense, unified image of the solar effect for the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P057: Je vois presentement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">interrompit la Marquise</span></span>, comment sont faits les Habitans de Vénus.

The source phrase 'interrompit la Marquise' (the Marquise interrupted) implies that the speaker was interrupted, but the addition of 'me' makes this direct object explicit, thereby enhancing clarity for the reader.","The translator added 'of their Temper' to the description 'for the coldness and stupidity'. This addition specifies that these qualities are inherent aspects of their disposition or character. The source phrase 'pour la froideur & pour la stupidité' (for the coldness and for the stupidity) does not explicitly state this, so the addition provides a more nuanced contextual detail.","The translator used 'given to Poetry and Musick' for the source 'faisant des Vers, aimant la Musique' (making verses, loving music). The phrase 'given to' introduces an element of strong inclination or habitual devotion. This elaborates on the original text by emphasizing a characteristic trait of being dedicated to these arts, rather than simply performing the actions or having an affection for them."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P058: Mais que sera-ce des Habitants de Mercure?

This strengthens the assertion, adding a degree of certainty from the narrator that is not as explicitly emphasized in the original French.","The French \"un grand poële ardent\" (a large burning stove/pan) is translated as \"a great burning Stove or Kettle\". The addition of \"or Kettle\" elaborates on the image, providing an alternative common heat-emitting object to ensure the English reader grasps the intended imagery.","The translator replaces the French \"apparemment\" (apparently, seemingly) with \"'tis certain.\" This is a significant addition as it changes the epistemic modality of the statement, making it definitive and assertive rather than speculative.","The French \"assez grandes\" (quite big, rather big, or big enough) is translated as \"very big.\" The word \"very\" is an addition that intensifies the size, conveying a greater magnitude than the more moderate term \"assez\" in the source text.","The French text states \"peut-être n'en reçoivent-ils point du tout\" (perhaps they receive none of it at all), where \"en\" refers to light from the other planets. The target text \"or perhaps no Light at all from thence\" adds \"from thence\" to explicitly state the origin (the other planets), clarifying for the reader.","The French phrase \"que plus petites\" (meaning \"only smaller\" or \"as smaller\") is rendered in the target text as \"but in a less proportion.\" While \"less\" corresponds to \"plus petites,\" the framing \"in a proportion\" is an addition that elaborates on the concept of being smaller, introducing a more formal or analytical nuance not present in the simpler French expression."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P059: Je ne suis pas si touchée, dit la Marquise, de cette perte-là que sont les Habitans de Mercure, que de l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de chaleur.

The source text, 'je ne connois plus de retenuë sur la Philosophie,' translates to 'I no longer know any restraint concerning Philosophy.' The addition of 'muse longer' specifies the intellectual activity (musing) and suggests an extended or intensified engagement, thereby elaborating on her newfound enthusiasm in a way not explicitly present in the source.","The translator changed the impersonal French construction 'permis à elles d'avoir' (it is permitted to them to have) to the direct address 'you must allow them'. This addition shifts the modality by introducing 'you' (the reader) as an active participant who 'must allow' certain motions. This creates a more engaging and authoritative tone, compelling the reader's assent, a feature not present in the source's more descriptive statement.","The translator added the specific scientific term 'Axis'. The source phrase 'tourner sur elle-même' means 'to turn upon itself,' implying rotation. The addition of 'Axis' in 'turn upon its own Axis' provides explicit technical clarification, making the astronomical concept of self-rotation more precise and accessible to an English audience potentially seeking clear scientific explanations.","The translator added the adverb 'uniformly' to describe the motion of the planets. The source text 'les fait tourner toutes en un même sens' means 'makes them all turn in the same direction/way.' The addition of 'uniformly' elaborates on this by specifying the regular, consistent, and ordered manner of this motion, thereby enhancing the scientific precision and clarity of the description for the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P065: Voilà quel est le grand Tourbillon dont le Soleil est comme le Maître; mais en même temps les Planetes se composent de petits Tourbillons particuliers à l'imitation de celuy du Soleil.

The French \"dans l'étenduë de notre Tourbillon\" (in the extent/reach of our Vortex) is expanded. \"Limits and extent\" elaborates on \"étendue\" by explicitly mentioning boundaries (\"limits\") as well as span (\"extent\"), providing a fuller description for the English reader. This use of doublets was a common stylistic choice in older English translations for clarity or emphasis.","The translator added \"doubtless \" to the phrase. The French \"il nous auroit engloutis sans peine\" translates to \"he would have swallowed us without difficulty\" or \"with ease\". The addition of \"doubtless\" intensifies the statement by adding a layer of certainty or conviction about Jupiter's ability to swallow Earth, an emphasis not explicitly conveyed by the source phrase \"sans peine\".","The translator added \"of place and \" before \"situation\". The French \"le seul hazard de la situation\" (the mere chance of the situation/location) becomes \"the chance only of place and situation\". This expansion into a doublet (\"place and situation\") makes the meaning of \"situation\" as a physical location more explicit and emphatic for the English audience, aligning with a common rhetorical practice.","The translator added \"of a man\" at the end of the phrase. The French \"toute la fortune qu'on doit avoir\" (all the fortune that one is to have) uses an impersonal pronoun (\"on\"). The addition \"of a man\" concretizes this general philosophical statement, making it more specific and perhaps more directly relatable by explicitly linking \"fortune\" to human experience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P066: Et qui nous assure, dit la Marquise, que nous demeurerons toûjours où nous sommes?

The translator's phrase 'the Planets still keep their old stations' includes the word 'old'. This addition of 'old' elaborates on the nature of the 'stations', emphasizing that these are established, long-held positions, a contextual detail not explicitly present in the source but added for clarity and emphasis regarding the planets' stability.","The source text 'qui se tiennent separées' means 'which keep themselves separate' or 'which remain separate'. The translator has rendered this as 'that shall continue separate and unmixed'. The addition of 'and unmixed' makes explicit what is implied by 'separées' in the context of liquids, thereby enhancing clarity for the reader by specifying that the liquids do not mingle.","The source text '& qui luy fait équilibre' means 'and which balances it' or 'which brings it to equilibrium'. The translator’s phrase 'and makes it of such equal poise' elaborates on this.

And must it not be likewise, said I, that the four Moons should from time to time send their Deputies to Iupiter, to make their Oath of Fidelity? for my part, I assure you that the little Superiority we have over the people of our Moon, makes me doubt whether Iupiter has much over the Inhabitants of his, and I believe the advantage he can most reasonably pretend to, is to frighten them; for example, in that which is nearest to him, he appears to them three hundred and sixty times bigger than our Moon appears to us; for he is so much bigger than she is: he is, I believe, nearer to them than she is to us, which still increases the bigness.</span></span> They have then that monstrous Planet daily hanging over their heads at a very little distance, and truly if the Gauls of old were afraid the Heavens would fall upon them, the Inhabitants of that Moon have much more cause to fear the fall of Iupiter. That is, possibly, says she, the fear they have instead of that of Eclipses, which you tell me they are free from, but must pay for it by some other folly. That is of absolute necessity, said I; the Inventor of the third System, whom I told you of the other day, the famous Tycho Brahe, the greatest Astronomer that ever was, he fear'd not Eclipses as the vulgar do; for his daily Conversation was with them; but would you believe what he fear'd instead of them? When he went at any time out of his Lodging, if the first person he met were an old Woman, or if a Hare cross'd his way, he believ'd it would be an unlucky day to him, and would presently return and shut himself up, and not dare to take in hand the least matter.</p>","explanations":["The translator inserted a lengthy passage, absent in the source, detailing speculative socio-political structures (colonies, laws, homage, deputies) for Jupiter's moon inhabitants and an astronomical comparison from the narrator regarding Jupiter's apparent size.

(an abbreviation for the Latin 'videlicet', meaning 'namely' or 'that is to say') to explicitly introduce the list of planets ('the Earth, Iupiter and Saturn'). While the source text presents this list by apposition after 'Planetes éloignées du Soleil' (Planets farthest distant from the Sun), the addition of 'viz.' makes the enumerative function clearer for the English reader.","The translator inserted 'therefore' to make the logical consequence explicit. The source uses a simple conjunction '&' (and) before 'il faut qu'il ait...' (he must have...). The addition of 'therefore' clarifies that Mars needing other resources for its nights is a direct consequence of it having no moon.","The translator added the participial phrase 'diffusing it' to elaborate on how the phosphores emit light. The source states they 'jettent un assez grand éclat' (cast/throw a rather great brightness) after being imbued with light ('s'en imbibent, & s'en penetrent'). The target's 'diffusing it... give a considerable light' introduces a more specific mechanism ('diffusing') for this light emission that is not detailed in the source.","The translator added the clause 'they give light enough' to the original consequence 'qu'on s'en peut servir pour lire' (that one can use them to read). This addition provides an explicit reason *why* or *how* the luminous birds can be used for reading. The phrase 'in the dark' at the end of the target segment echoes 'dans les tenebres' (in the darkness) from the source, which originally qualified the luminosity of the birds."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oiseaux.

This addition introduces the human observer ('we') and the act of perception ('find'), shifting the statement towards an empirical or experiential account, possibly to make the scientific point more relatable or to reflect an observational approach.","The translator added 'You see' to replace the French presentative phrase 'Les voilà donc' (which means approximately 'So, there they are' or 'Behold them').

And 'tis thought that the fixed Stars give us a trembling Light, and seem to twinkle only, because their Vortices perpetually press upon ours, and are pressed by it.</p>","explanations":["The translator added 'and Judgment' alongside 'Wit' for the French 'esprit' to more fully convey the broad meaning of 'esprit,' which includes discernment or sagacity, aspects that 'Wit' alone might not sufficiently capture for an English audience, thereby clarifying the type of mental acuity being praised.","The source text uses 'aussi tôt' (immediately, then), which primarily indicates a temporal sequence. The translator added 'in that case' to establish a more explicit logical condition, clarifying that Nature's action of filling the void is a direct response to the specific circumstance of a void appearing, rather than just a subsequent event.","The French phrase 'qui ménage bien le terrain' (literally 'who manages the ground/space well') is somewhat idiomatic. The translator elaborated this into the more explicit and less metaphorical phrase 'who knows well how to manage the matter,' making Nature's efficiency and purposeful action clearer and more accessible to the English reader.","The translator added 'otherwise' to the clause describing the corners of the universe (translating 'qui fussent demeurez inutiles' – 'that would have remained useless'). This addition makes the counterfactual condition—that these corners would indeed be useless if not for being filled by the small worlds—more explicit for the English reader, whereas the French subjunctive implies this nuance less directly."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

The target rendering 'either with a bright shining Perriwig' includes the specific noun 'Perriwig.'

Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes;</span></span> &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration,</span></span> je ne les en croirois pas encore, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">j'attendrois une plus longue experience.</span></span> Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, il faut que l'espce se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage. De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, répliquai-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au-delà, il faudroit être plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent être ou n'être pas si on veut, ou être tels que l'on veut, il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P106: I need not then, continued I, think any more of persuading you to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, but I hope, at least, you will compassionate those that live in a Vortex where the Sun is extinct —. How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</p> <p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</p> <p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature. Has not she the secret of causing Herbs and Plants to spring and dye in a continual Revolution? I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it.</p> <p>P111: In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that I have e'en left them.</p> <p>P112: Let us leave them more yet, said I, if you'l be persuaded by me, and talk no more of them; for you are now come to the highest Roof of Heaven, and to tell you whether there be Stars beyond that or not, will require more knowledge than I have. Place Worlds there, or place them not, 'twill depend upon your self.

This addition explicitly frames the roses' subsequent statement as an act of \"reasoning\" and uses more formal phrasing, clarifying the logical process for the reader.","The source phrase \"de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy,\" (from the memory of a rose, one has only seen him) is translated as \"our History tells us of no other,\". The translator elevates the quaint \"memory of a rose\" to the more formal \"our History\" and rephrases the observation into a declarative statement, adding a layer of formality and explicitness for the target audience.","The source implies the Ancients' reasoning or foundation (\"celuy que faisoient les Anciens\") regarding celestial bodies. The target text \"than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies\" adds \"for their Opinion,\" which explicitly clarifies that this foundation or reasoning supported their specific \"Opinion,\" thereby providing more context not present in the source.","The source phrase \"quand ils paroîtroient marquer\" (even if they seemed to indicate/show) is expanded in the target text. The phrase \"in themselves any Sign or Character\" is added to specify *how* or *through what means* the heavens might indicate eternal duration. This addition makes the hypothetical condition more concrete and detailed than the general verb \"marquer\".","The source \"j'attendrois une plus longue experience\" (I would await a longer experience) simply states an action. The target \"but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience\" adds the phrase \"farther satisfaction from,\" which explains the *purpose* or desired outcome of waiting for this longer experience, an element of motivation not explicit in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers!</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Je suis savante!</span></span></span></span> Oüy, répliquay-je, vous l'êtes assez raisonnablement, &amp; vous l'êtes avec la commodité de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra.

This addition enhances the vividness of her exclamation in English, making the temporal context more explicit than in the French source, which relies on the present tense ('j'ay' - I have) and the exclamatory context.","The translator added 'now' to emphasize the Marquise's current state of being knowledgeable, directly following her realization. This addition provides clarity and reinforces the transformative impact of the preceding discourse, making her new status ('I am now knowing') explicit in time, whereas the source 'Je suis savante!' (I am learned!) implies this through context.","The translator elaborated the French predicate adjective 'savante' (learned/knowing, feminine) into the noun phrase 'a knowing Woman.' The source 'Je suis savante!' translates directly to 'I am learned/knowing.' While 'savante' inherently indicates a female subject through its feminine grammatical form, the addition of the explicit noun 'Woman' changes the grammatical structure. This choice makes the subject's gender explicit as a noun and may be perceived as creating a more natural-sounding or rhetorically complete expression in English for this declaration."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P106: FIN</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P115: FINIS.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P115: FINIS.</p>","explanations":[]}],"counts":{"manual":6,"ai":389}}
