Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">la chose m'y porte necessairement.</span></span> La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir.</span></span> Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit?</span></span></span></span> Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante.</span></span> Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune.</span></span> Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses intérests, fist aussi le mesme effet.</span></span> Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connais? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciements, luy dis-je.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes;</span></span> le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné.</span></span></span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos.</span></span> On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">&amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver.</span></span> Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe</span></span>, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle</span></span>, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">tous ces Mondes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes? me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy?</span></span> Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\">Quelle est donc cette folie? reprit-elle.</span></span> Helas! répliquai-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourrait bien être un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison?</span></span> Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">apprenez-moy vos Etoiles.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">Non, répliquai-je,</span></span> il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"29\">j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.</span></span></span></span> Cherchez ailleurs des Philosophes </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description, which I cannot well avoid, the fineness of it leading me so necessarily to it.</p> <p>P003: The Moon was about an hour high, which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, and checker'd the Paths beneath with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light; there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed: These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation; but the Presence of a Person of her Wit and Beauty hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars. Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day? I confess, said she, the Day must yield to such a Night; the day which resembles a fair Beauty, which though more sparkling, is not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night. You are very generous, Madam, said I, to give the advantage to the brown, you who are so admirably fair your self: Yet without dispute, day is the most beautiful thing in Nature; and most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair. But, said she, Beauty is insipid, if it want the pleasure and power of charming; and you must acknowledge that the brightest day that ever you saw could never have engaged you in so agreeable an Ecstasie, as you were just now like to have faln into by the powerful attractions of this Night.</p> <p>P004: I agree to what you say, Madam, said I, but I must own at the same time, that a Beauty of your complexion would give me another sort of transport than the finest Night with all the advantages obscurity can give it.</p> <p>P005: Though that were true, said she, I should not be satisfied; since those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other. How comes it, that Lovers who are the best Judges of what is pleasing and touching, do always address themselves to the Night, in all their Songs and Elegies? I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that? The silence and gloom of the Night, said I, inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing. Besides, the Scene of the Universe by day-light appears too Uniform, we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts. Sir, replied Madam la Marqueise, I have always felt those effects of Night you tell me of, I love the Stars, and could be heartily angry with the Sun for taking them from my sight. Ah, cry'd I, I cannot forgive his taking from me the sight of all those Worlds that are there. Worlds, said she, what Worlds? And looking earnestly upon me, asked me again, what I meant? I ask your Pardon, Madam, said I, I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness. What weakness, said she, more earnestly than before? Alass, said I, I am sorry that I must confess I have imagined to my self, that every Star may perchance be another World, yet I would not swear that it is so; but I will believe it to be true, because that Opinion is so pleasant to me, and gives me very diverting Idea's, which have fixed themselves delightfully in my Imaginations, and 'tis necessary that even solid Truth should have it's agreeableness. Well, said she, since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it; I will believe whatever you please concerning the Stars, if I find it pleasant. Ah, Madam, said I, hastily, it is not such a Pleasure as you find in one of Mullier's Plays; it is a Pleasure that is-I know not where, in our Reason, and which only transports the Mind. What, replied she, do you think me then incapable of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind? I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars. Ah, Madam, cry'd I, I shall never indure to be reproach'd with that neglect of my own happiness, that in a Grove at ten a Clock of the Night, I talk'd of nothing but Philosophy, to the greatest Beauty in the World; no, Madam, search for Philosophy some where else.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description, which I cannot well avoid, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">the fineness of it</span></span> leading me so necessarily to it. </p><p>P003: The Moon was about an hour high, which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">and checker'd the Paths beneath</span></span> with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light; there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed: These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">silent</span></span> Contemplation; but the Presence of a Person <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">of her Wit and Beauty</span></span> hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars.

This addition provides a clearer rationale for her preceding statement in the English text.","The translator adds the clause 'for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs.' to provide a reason why lovers thank the night, an explanation not present in the concise source statement.","The translator adds 'as a true Confident of all their Entrigues' to elaborate on why the night receives lovers' complaints, characterizing the night's role more explicitly than the source.","The translator shifts focus from what the day lacks (inspiration for sad/passionate feelings, 'qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste & de passionné') to what the night *provides*, adding descriptive elements such as 'The silence and gloom of the Night,' and 'the restless Sigher,' and elaborating the feeling into 'thoughts very passionate and languishing,'.","This clause, 'which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways', is entirely new, added by the translator to create a direct contrast with the effect of the night, describing how the day diverts passionate thoughts.","The translator adds this parenthetical remark, '(though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose),' to introduce a nuanced counterpoint to the idea of night inspiring restlessness, an element not directly present in the source which simply states 'Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos' (it seems during the night that all is at rest).","This extensive clause, 'and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self;', is a new addition by the translator, acknowledging that the day can offer quiet places, yet implying these differ from the night's effect, adding complexity not in the source's simpler day/night contrast.","The translator significantly expands and reinterprets 'on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux' (one is so mad/foolish that one dreams better of it). The addition of 'vain enough' and the elaborate phrase 'to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing.' provides a more specific psychological interpretation.","The translator adds 'of a Vast Extent' to elaborate on the description of the daytime sky ('une voûte bleüe'), enhancing the sense of its scale.","The translator adds 'silent' to 'thoughts,' specifying the nature of the 'desordre de pensées' (disorder of thoughts) as internal and quiet, an aspect not explicit in the source.","The translator clarifies the somewhat vague 'ce que vous me dites' (what you tell me) by specifying it as 'those effects of Night you tell me of,' providing more context for the reader.","The translator adds 'that are there' to 'all those Worlds,' reinforcing the idea that these worlds are located in the night sky among the stars, providing slight spatial emphasis.","The translator adds an initial exclamation 'Worlds, said she,' before the Marquise's question 'what Worlds?' to heighten the sense of her surprise or curiosity, which is conveyed more directly in the source's single question.","The translator rephrases the narrator's admission, changing 'Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, & aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échappée' (You set me on my folly, and my imagination immediately escaped) to the more elaborate and introspective 'I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness.' This addition provides a more nuanced psychological portrayal.","The translator adds the descriptive phrase 'more earnestly than before' to characterize the Marquise's tone or manner when she asks 'Quelle est donc cette folie?', an element not present in the source.","The translator elaborates on 'des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison' (pleasures that are only in reason) by explaining them as those 'which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind,' providing a more descriptive account of these intellectual pleasures.","The translator expands the direct command 'apprenez-moy vos Etoiles' (teach me your stars) into the more elaborate 'at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars,' adding a temporal condition and specifying the scope of teaching ('what you know of').","The translator adds the phrase 'with that neglect of my own happiness,' to specify what the reproach ('il ne me sera point reproché que...') would imply for the narrator—that discussing philosophy in such a setting would be a missed opportunity. This interprets the narrator's reluctance more personally.","The translator replaces 'la plus aimable personne que je connoisse' (the most lovable/kind person I know) with the more emphatic and conventional compliment 'to the greatest Beauty in the World,' heightening the romantic undertones of the scene.","The translator adds the expressive 'Ah, Madam, cry'd I,' to the beginning of the narrator's refusal, making his response more dramatic or emphatic than the simple 'Non, répliquai-je' (No, I replied) in the source."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">il fallut ceder.</span></span> Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière de Physique, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; &amp; les Planètes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des mondes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">J'en revenois toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">A la fin cependant,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie,</span></span> voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P006: But 'twas in vain to put her off by Excuses, from a Novelty she was already but too much prepossest with: There was a necessity of yielding, and all I could do was to prevail with her to be secret, for the saving my Honour; but when I found my self engaged past retreat, and had a design to speak, I knew not where to begin my discourse, for to prove to her (who understood nothing of Natural Philosophy) that the Earth was a Planet, and all the other Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars Worlds, it was necessary for the explaining my self, to bring my Arguments a great way off; and therefore I still endeavoured to perswade her that 'twas much better to pass the time in another manner of Conversation, which the most reasonable People in our Circumstances would do; but I pleaded to no Purpose, and at last to satisfie her, and give her a general Idea of Philosophy, I made use of this way of arguing.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P006: But 'twas in vain to put her off by Excuses, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">from a Novelty she was already but too much prepossest with</span></span>: There was a necessity of yielding, and all I could do was to prevail with her to be secret, for the saving my Honour; but when I found my self engaged past retreat, and had a design to speak, I knew not where to begin my discourse, for to prove to her (who understood nothing of Natural Philosophy) that the Earth was a Planet, and all the other Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars Worlds, it was necessary <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">for the explaining my self,</span></span> to bring my Arguments a great way off; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">and therefore</span></span> I still endeavoured to perswade her that 'twas much better to pass the time in another manner of Conversation, which the most reasonable People in our Circumstances would do; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">but I pleaded to no Purpose, and</span></span> at last <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">to satisfie her, and</span></span> give her a general Idea of Philosophy, I made use of this way of arguing.</p>","explanations":["The translator adds this phrase to provide a clearer reason for the speaker's yielding. The source states 'il fallut ceder' (I had to yield). The addition explains that the Marquise's strong preoccupation with the 'Novelty' (the topic) made further resistance futile, thus enhancing the narrative logic and clarity for the English reader.","The source states 'il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver' (it was necessary to take things from afar, to prove to her). The target text inserts 'for the explaining my self,' before 'to bring my Arguments a great way off; for to prove to her...'. This addition clarifies the speaker's internal process or an additional motivation, suggesting that the elaborate explanation was not only for the Marquise's understanding but also integral to how the speaker needed to structure his own discourse, thus adding a layer of justification.","The source begins 'J'en revenois toujours à luy dire...' (I always came back to telling her...). The translator adds the conjunction 'and therefore' at the start of the translation of this clause. This explicitly links the speaker's recurring suggestion to discuss trifles with the previously mentioned difficulty of explaining complex physics, enhancing coherence for the reader by making the logical connection overt.","The source phrase 'A la fin cependant,' (In the end, however / At last, however) begins the sentence about the speaker's decision to explain philosophy. The target text inserts 'but I pleaded to no Purpose, and' before 'at last' (the translation of 'A la fin'). This addition elaborates on the narrative, summarizing the failure of the speaker's previous attempts to change the subject (implied in the previous source sentence), providing an explicit narrative bridge and enhancing coherence.","The source text states the speaker's aim as 'pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie' (to give her a general idea of Philosophy). The translator expands this in the target to 'to satisfie her, and give her a general Idea of Philosophy'. The addition 'to satisfie her, and' makes explicit an additional motivation for the speaker's actions – the desire to please or content the Marquise – which, while inferable from the context, is not directly stated in the French text, thus adding a nuance to the speaker's intention for clarity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">&amp; les yeux mauvais</span></span>; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes</span></span>: &amp; si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le savoir, ce qui reviendrait au même.

translator added 'in the whole' to 'Pit' (which translates 'Parterre'), intensifying the uniqueness of the Enginier by suggesting he is the only one in the entire area.","The translator added 'so new and' to elaborate on why the flight ('Vol') appeared 'extraordinaire' (extraordinary), adding the dimension of novelty.","The translator expanded beyond 'Ropes' (translating 'cordes') to include 'Pullies, Wheels and Weights,' providing a more detailed list of hidden mechanisms consistent with the theatrical metaphor, elements not all present in the immediate source phrase.","This clause elaborates on the function of the hidden mechanisms within the metaphor of Nature as an opera, specifying that they 'give motion to the different Scenes,' an explicit functional description not present in the source's structure.","The translator added 'and understanding' to 'from our sight' to emphasize that the concealment is not just physical but also intellectual, making the mechanisms difficult to comprehend.","The translator specified the indefinite pronoun 'on' (one/people) as 'mankind,' giving a broader, more universal scope to the historical difficulty of understanding the universe.","The translator added 'the vast Frame of' to 'the Universe,' emphasizing its large-scale, structured nature, enhancing the imagery.","The translator added 'and Pullies' to 'Ropes' (which translates 'cordes'), specifying a common component used with ropes in theatrical machinery, thus elaborating on the unseen mechanisms.","The translator specified the indefinite pronoun 'on' (one/people) as 'men,' clarifying who holds this new belief.","The translator added 'it self' to 'moves' to emphasize the Cartesian idea that bodies lack inherent power of self-motion, requiring an external cause.","The translator added 'set on Motion, or' before 'pusht by another Body,' broadening the ways a body can be moved externally, covering a wider range of mechanical interactions.","The translator specified 'any heavy thing' for the pronoun 'il' (it, referring to 'un corps'), clarifying the nature of the object whose ascent or descent is being discussed.","The translator added this descriptive phrase to explain the function and nature of a 'contrepoids' (counter-poise/counterweight), clarifying that it works by being 'equal with it in weight to balance it.'","The translator specified the indefinite pronoun 'on' (one/people) as 'men,' clarifying who might become ashamed of the mechanical philosophy.","The translator rendered 'On veut' (One wants / It is wanted) as 'for some would have,' specifying that this view of the universe is held by 'some' people rather than being a universal desire or acceptance.","The translator added 'just and equal' to describe the 'disposal' (arrangement) of parts, emphasizing the precision and balance implied in the clockwork metaphor of the universe.","The translator added the direct address 'Confess the Truth, Madam,' to make the dialogue more vivid and to set a slightly more engaging tone for the question that follows.","The translator added 'believed they' before 'knew it,' introducing a nuance of subjectivity or perception to the act of knowing the universe, not present in the simpler 'l'avoient connu' (had known it).","The translator added 'better' to 'knew it,' implying a more complete or advanced state of knowledge than the original 'connu' (known).","The translator added 'to me' to personalize the Marquise's statement of surprise, changing the impersonal 'Il est surprenant' (It is surprising) to a direct expression of her feeling.","The translator expanded 'l'ordre de la Nature' (the order of Nature) to 'the course and order of Nature,' using a common English doublet to add emphasis or breadth to the concept of Nature's regularity.","The translator added 'it appears to be' to 'how ever admirable,' subtly shifting from a statement of fact ('as admirable as it is') to a perception ('as admirable as it appears to be').","The translator expanded 'choses' (things) to 'Principles and Things,' adding a layer of abstraction and suggesting that Nature operates not just on simple objects but also on simple underlying rules or laws.","The translator expanded 'si simples' (so simple) to 'so very easie and simple.' 'easie' is an elaboration of 'simples,' and 'very' is an intensifier, reinforcing the idea of simplicity.","The translator expanded 'un faux Merveilleux' (a false Marvelous/Wonder) into 'some false Principle or other of Admiration.' This addition clarifies that the 'false Marvelous' is not just a vague sense of wonder but a flawed basis or 'Principle' for admiration.","The translator specified 'eux' (them) as 'those sort of People,' reinforcing the distinction between the enlightened Marquise and others who hold onto a 'false Marvelous.'","The translator added 'begin to' before 'understand it,' emphasizing the initial stage of comprehension as the point where admiration (for 'those sort of People') might fade.","The translator added the phrase 'without further Preface,' to signal a transition to the main exposition, an idiomatic way in English to indicate that preliminary remarks are over and the core subject will now be addressed."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.</span></span> On les appelle Fixes, parce qu'elles ne paroissent avoir que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">le mouvement de leur Ciel</span></span> qui les emporte avec foy d'Orient en Occident.

Ce n'est pas la vraie vie pastorale, que de parler des Planètes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps.</span></span> Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages</span></span>, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers</span></span>, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planètes</span></span>, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoi vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moi je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuements des Planetes ne sont pas si réguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoient imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">par lesquels ils sauvoient toutes ces bizarreries.</span></span> L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roi d' Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il lui eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus.</span></span> Les bons avis que ce Roi voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvements celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles fixes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal</span></span>, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoient-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois</span></span>, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil</span></span>, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roi d' Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">il est d'une simplicité charmante</span></span>, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">votre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere</span></span>, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle.</span></span> Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement</span></span>, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je.</span></span> La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers</span></span>, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers</span></span>, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation. Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire.</span></span> Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes</span></span>, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours</span></span>; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer</span></span>: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy. </p><p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il? Avez-vous remarqué, lui répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">Elle va vers le but où elle est envoyée</span></span>, &amp; en même temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-même, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut.</span></span> La Terre fait la même chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\">Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre</span></span>, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le côté où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse. Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la même cause. Les Planètes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nôtre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planètes marchent aussi; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard</span></span>, &amp; nous fait paroître dans leur cours des bizarreries dont il n'est pas nécessaire que je vous parle. Il suffit que vous sachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irrégulier dans les Planètes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont notre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fond elles sont toutes très-reglées. Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">on ne l'a guere ménagée</span></span>, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité.. Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\">si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures.</span></span> </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"29\">le mouvement ne leur coúte rien</span></span>; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">un gros Navire monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises?</span></span> Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"31\">Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste</span></span>, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes.

Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</p> <p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination</span></span>; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves</span></span>, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy.

There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties. </p><p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth.</span></span> Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence</span></span>, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again.</span></span> The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power</span></span>; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe</span></span>; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died.</span></span> Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him</span></span>; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily:</span></span> And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands</span></span>, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown</span></span>; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below:</span></span> 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\">so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun:</span></span> And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them</span></span>, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns</span></span>, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\">if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis.</span></span> Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"29\">swiftness of Motion is easie to them</span></span>; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing?</span></span> Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"31\">So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter</span></span>, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"32\">And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"33\">It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The translator specified 'plus tendre' (more tender) as 'of a more Amorous Inclination,' adding a specific interpretation of the required disposition for poetry.","The translator elaborated 'à la campagne' (in the countryside) into 'happily retired in the Fields and Groves,' adding the emotional state 'happily retired' and specifying the environment.","The source implies a contrast with the pastoral life of Astrée's characters.

This addition makes the ship's description more vivid upfront.","The translator replaced the general 'le gros Vaisseau' (the large ship) with the more specific 'First-Rate Frigat,' adding a level of naval detail and specificity likely intended to resonate with an English audience and make the image more concrete.","The translator added 'Madam' as a polite form of address when the philosopher responds to the Marquise, maintaining consistency in the dialogue's formality.","The translator explicitly named 'Madam la Marquiese' where the source used the pronoun 'elle' (she). This addition provides clarity by identifying the speaker directly for the English reader.","The source 'en peril de se mouvoir' (in danger of moving/being unstable) is rendered as 'in any danger of falling.' The specific notion of 'falling' is an addition by the translator to make the danger more concrete and dramatic, going beyond the more general 'moving'.","The translator expanded the French 'Cela le meriteroit bien' (That would well deserve it/They would be quite right) into the more emphatic English idiom 'They wou'd have all the reason in the World to do so,' intensifying the statement.","The translator added 'Madam' as a polite form of address in the philosopher's speech, consistent with the other instances.","The phrase 'pour dormir en assurance' (to sleep in safety/security) is translated as 'to sleep in quiet, without fear of falling.' The addition 'without fear of falling' specifies the nature of the security sought, linking it to the previously mentioned 'danger of falling' and making the Marquise's concern more explicit.","The translator inserted 'Madam,' as a vocative after 'And' (translating '&'), enhancing the direct address to the Marquise in the English rendering.","The translator used a doublet 'pleasant and agreeable' to render 'réjouissantes' (delightful/joyful). 'Agreeable' is an addition that amplifies 'pleasant,' a common stylistic choice in English for emphasis and fullness of expression.","The translator added 'time' to 'in four and twenty Hours' for grammatical completeness and idiomatic naturalness in English phrasing.","The translator added 'on their tops' to explicitly state the location of the 'Half-moons' (crescents on the spires/pyramids), providing a clearer visual detail than the source, where this placement is implied.","The translator added 'after them' as an explicit transitional phrase to improve the narrative flow and clearly sequence the series of imagined sights, where the source uses 'tantôt' (sometimes/now...then...) more sparsely.","The translator elaborated on 'de grands Païs' (large lands/countries) by adding the descriptive phrase 'spacious Fields, without Towns,' offering a more vivid and specific image of these uninhabited or sparsely populated areas.","The source mentions 'des Cabanes' (huts). The translator expanded this to 'Tents and Huts' by adding 'Tents and,' thereby diversifying the types of simple dwellings imagined and enriching the description for the target audience.","The translator added 'by this System' to the conjunction 'Ainsi donc' (So therefore), explicitly linking the Marquise's deduction to the Copernican system under discussion, thus providing crucial context not overtly stated at that point in the source.","The translator elaborated the phrase 'à le prendre dans l'air' (taking it in the air / considering the place in the air) into the more concrete 'that space of Air which our Bodies fill.' This addition clarifies the abstract concept by giving it a more tangible, physical dimension for easier understanding.","The source states 'nous y revenons' (we return there/to it). The translator's choice of 'hither' specifically adds the meaning of 'to this place,' making the direction of return more explicit and immediate.","The phrase 'nous y revenons' (we return there/to it) is further expanded with 'to our own place again.' This addition clarifies the destination ('our own place') and emphasizes the repetitive nature of the return ('again'), reinforcing the cyclical movement being described."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P014: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Copernic, luy répondis-je, ne le comprendroit pas mieux.</span></span> D'abord il passera par icy des Anglois qui raisonneront peut-être de quelque dessein de Politique <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">avec moins de gayeté</span></span> que nous ne raisonnons de notre Philosophie; ensuite viendra une grànde Mer, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">il se pourra trouver en ce lieu-là quelque Vaisseau</span></span> qui n'y sera pas si à son aise que nous.

The translation 'with more Gravity, but less Pleasure' adds the phrase 'more Gravity, but' to explicitly introduce the quality of seriousness ('Gravity') as an accompanying or contrasting characteristic, thereby elaborating on their demeanor.","The French 'il se pourra trouver ... quelque Vaisseau' (one might find ... some vessel) indicates the potential presence of ships. The translator adds the participle 'sailing' to provide a more active and descriptive image of the ships in the ocean, an action implied but not explicitly stated in the source.","The French 'qui fera semblant de ne s'en pas soucier' (who will pretend not to care about it) refers to the prisoners' reaction. The translator adds 'at what they suffer' to explicitly clarify the object of their feigned indifference, making the prisoners' stoicism more direct for the reader.","The French 'd'accorder tout au premier venu' means 'to grant everything to the first comer.' The translator renders 'tout' (everything) as 'any Favour.' The phrase 'any Favour' is an addition that specifies and perhaps euphemizes the nature of 'everything' that might be granted, providing a more explicit interpretation for the English audience.","The source text mentions 'de petits Tartares' (Little Tartars). The translator adds 'the Crim, or' before 'Little Tartars' to provide a more specific ethnonym or geographical identifier (Crimean Tartars), offering additional context likely deemed helpful for English readers of the time.","The French 'qui iront voler des Femmes' (who will go to steal women) describes an action. The translation 'who live by stealing of Wives' adds 'who live by,' which shifts the meaning to suggest that stealing women is their habitual practice or means of subsistence, an elaboration not explicit in the source's verb form implying a future or specific action.","The source text has 'qui debiterons peut-être encore des rêveries' (who will perhaps again utter reveries/fantasies). The translation 'perhaps talking as we do now' reinterprets 'rêveries.'

This emphasizes the imaginative quality of the discourse.","The translator adds 'several' to 'Objects,' implying a multiplicity or variety of objects, a nuance not explicitly present in the source's definite article 'les' (the).","The translator added 'that pass under me' to 'the several Objects,' making explicit the spatial relationship and movement of these objects relative to the Marquise, who is imagined to be viewing them from above as the Earth turns. This clarifies the dynamic nature of the scene.","The translator inserts this descriptive clause to elaborate on why the husbands find a 'superfluity' in their wives' 'favors' (source). It explicitly links the wives' beauty ('so many Charms in their Embraces') to the husbands being 'more than satisfied,' thus providing a clearer rationale for their subsequent actions.","The translator changes the object of abandonment from the source's 'un superflu [de faveurs]' (a surplus [of favors]) to 'their fair Wives.' This makes the statement more direct, specifying that the women themselves (additionally described as 'fair') are given to strangers, a more concrete and possibly sensational interpretation not explicit in the source.","The translator adds the adverb 'freely' to 'abandon,' emphasizing the willingness or lack of constraint in the husbands' actions. This introduces a nuance about the manner of abandonment not explicitly present in the source's simple 'abandonnent' (abandon).","The translator adds 'no doubt,' to 'You have seen,' emphasizing the certainty or commonality of the Marquise's supposed experience. This makes the narrator's address more engaging or persuasive.","The translator adds 'are compact, and wrought together with Silk,' to enhance the description of the cocoons beyond the source's 'Elles sont d'une soye fort serrée' (They are of a very tight silk). 'Compact' is an additional descriptor, and 'wrought together with Silk' elaborates on their material composition and structure.","The translator adds the adjective 'soft' to describe the 'Down' (duvet) representing the air. While the silkworm's down was earlier described with qualities implying softness ('fort leger & fort lâche'), the 'duvet' for the air in the source ('une espèce de duvet') lacks this explicit qualifier at this point. The addition enhances the imagery.","The translator uses 'thickness' to clarify that 'vinght lieües de hauteur' (twenty leagues of height) refers to the depth or three-dimensional extent of the air layer surrounding the Earth. This makes the description more scientifically precise or intuitively understandable as a layer.","The translator adds 'I spoke of' after 'Celestial Matter.' The source simply introduces 'la matiere celeste' (the celestial matter). This addition creates an anaphoric reference, suggesting a previous mention by the narrator, which can enhance narrative cohesion or make the concept seem familiar to the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P016: Vous me présentez la Terre <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">sous des idées bien méprisables</span></span>, dit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">la Marquise</span></span>.

'Tis certainly true, said I, Madam; while at the same time, Nature, who is not at the pains to consider these Troubles and Commotions, carries us all along together, by a general Motion, and does, as it were, play with this little Globe. It seems to me, said she, that 'tis very ridiculous to inhabit any thing that turns so often, and is so much agitated; and the worst of all is, that we are not assur'd whether we turn round, or not; for, to be plain with you, and that I may keep none of my Doubts from you, I do extreamly suspect, that all the Pre-cautions you can take, will not convince me of the Motion of the Earth: For is it possible, but Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us some sensible Sign, by which we might discover the turning round of so vast a Body? The Motions (answer'd I) which are most natural to remove, are the least perceptible; and which holds true, even in Morality; for the Motion of Self-love is so natural to us, that for the most part we do not feel it, while we believe we act by other Principles. Ah, said she, do you begin to speak of Moral Philosophy, when the Question is of that which is altogether natural? But I perceive you are sleepy, and begin to yawn; let us therefore retire, for there's enough said for the first Night, to morrow we shall return hither again; you with your Systems, and I with my Ignorance. In returning to the Castle, to make an end of what might be said to Systems, I told her, there was a third Opinion invented by Ticho-brahe, who wou'd have the Earth absolutely immoveable, and plac'd in the Centre of the Universe, and made the Sun to turn round it, as he did the other Planets to turn round the Sun; because, since the new Discoveries, it cou'd not be imagin'd that the other Planets turn'd round the Earth. But my Lady Marquiese, whose Judgment and Understanding is solid and penetrating, found, there was too much Affectation in endeavouring to free the Earth from turning round the Sun, since several other great Bodies cou'd not be exempt from that Labour; and that the Sun was not so proper and fit to turn round the Earth, since the other Planets turn round the Sun; and that this new System was only good to maintain the standing still of the Earth, if one had a mind to undertake that Argument; but 'tis not proper to perswade another to believe it.

It seems to me, said she, that 'tis very ridiculous to inhabit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">any thing that turns so often</span></span>, and is so much agitated; and the worst of all is, that we are not assur'd whether we turn round, or not; for, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">to be plain with you, and that I may keep none of my Doubts from you</span></span>, I do extreamly suspect, that all the Pre-cautions you can take, will not convince me of the Motion of the Earth: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">For is it possible, but Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us some sensible Sign</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">by which we might discover the turning round of so vast a Body</span></span>?

This addition serves to emphasize that these ideas originate from the philosopher, reinforcing the Marquise's commentary for clarity.","The translator added the vocative 'Madam' to the philosopher's response. This is a conventional expression of politeness in English dialogue of the period, naturalizing the conversation for the target audience.","The translator added 'so often' to the phrase 'any thing that turns'. This intensifies the description of the Earth's movement, perhaps to emphasize the Marquise's sense of absurdity or discomfort.","The translator expanded 'à ne vous rien celer' (to hide nothing from you) into 'to be plain with you, and that I may keep none of my Doubts from you'. The latter clause is an addition that explicitly states the Marquise's intention to reveal her 'Doubts,' providing more context for her skepticism.","The translator replaced the impersonal French construction 'qu'il ne laissera pas' (that it will not leave) with 'Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us'. This addition introduces 'Nature' as an agent and suggests a deliberate provision of signs, personifying the process and aligning with potential contemporary English modes of discussing Natural Philosophy.","The translator added 'of so vast a Body' to the clause. The source refers to recognizing 'it' (the movement); this addition specifies that 'it' is a 'vast Body' (the Earth) and emphasizes its scale, thereby underscoring the Marquise's point about the unlikelihood of such a large movement going unnoticed.","The translator replaced the French impersonal idiom 'cela s'appelle bâiller' (literally 'that is called yawning', meaning 'that's boring') with the direct observation 'But I perceive you are sleepy, and begin to yawn;'. This addition changes the meaning by personalizing the interaction and attributing the yawn directly to the philosopher's perceived state of being sleepy, rather than a general comment on the conversation.","The translator added the honorific 'my Lady' before 'Marquiese'. This reflects a common and polite form of address for aristocratic women in English contemporary to the translation, naturalizing the dialogue for the target audience.","The translator rendered the French noun 'le discernement' (judgment, insight) as the doublet 'Judgment and Understanding'. The addition of 'and Understanding' elaborates on the Marquise's intellectual faculties, a common stylistic choice in older English to add emphasis or fullness.","The translator added 'from that Labour' to the description of celestial bodies' motion. The source states they couldn't be exempted from turning; 'from that Labour' adds a characterization of this motion as an effort or task, making the Marquise's reasoning more vivid.","The translator rendered the French 'si propre' (so proper/suitable) as 'so proper and fit'. The addition of 'and fit' creates a doublet, a stylistic device used for emphasis and to convey the full semantic range of 'propre' in English.","The translator rendered 'la simplicité dont il est' (its simplicity) as 'its Simplicity and Easiness'. The addition of 'and Easiness' as a doublet elaborates on the qualities of Copernicus's system, suggesting its comprehensibility contributes to its persuasiveness along with its simplicity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: SECOND SOIR.

A little after this, there came Company to visit my Lady, which, according to the nauseous Country-fashion, stay'd till the Evening, and yet we thought our selves happy that we were so easily rid of 'em then, since, according to the custom of the Country, they might have prolong'd their Visit till the next Day; but they were so civil, as not to do it; so that Madam the Marquiese and I found our selves at liberty.

Said she, I never heard of the Moon's being inhabited, but as a Fable. So it may be still, said I; I concern my self no further in these Matters, than Men use to do in Civil Wars; where the Uncertainty of what may be, makes People still entertain a Correspondence with the adverse Party: As for me, tho' I see the Moon inhabited, I live very civilly with those that do not believe it; and I carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">upon occasion,</span></span> with Honour go over to their side who have the better; but still they gain some considerable Advantage over us.

It may be, some body standing by, wou'd represent to him, That it was true, one cou'd not see the Inhabitants of St. Denis from our Lady's Church, but that the distance was the cause of it; yet that all we cou'd see of St. Denis, was very like to Paris; for St. Denis had Steeples, Houses and Walls; and that it might resemble Paris in every thing else, and be inhabited as well as it. All these Arguments wou'd not prevail upon my Citizen; who wou'd continue still obstinate in maintaining, that St. Denis was not inhabited, because he saw none of the People. The Moon is our St. Denis, and we the Citizens of Paris, that never went out of our own Town. Ah, interrupted the Marquiese, you do us wrong; we are not so foolish as your Citizens of Paris: Since he sees that St. Denis is so like to Paris in every thing, he must have lost his Reason, if he did not think it was inhabited: But for the Moon, that's nothing like the Earth. Have a care, Madam, said I, what you say; for if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth, you are oblig'd to believe that the Moon is inhabited. I acknowledge, said she, if you do that, I must yield; and your Looks are so assur'd, that you frighten me already: The two different Motions of the Earth, which wou'd never have enter'd into my Thoughts, make me very apprehensive of all you say.

The English translation makes this relief explicit and personal by adding 'and yet we thought our selves happy that we were so easily rid of 'em then,' detailing the narrator's feelings of relief which are not directly expressed with such candor in the source.","The French 'la conversation ne manqua pas de tourner aussitôt sur nos Sistêmes' (the conversation did not fail to turn immediately to our systems) indicates a quick return to the topic. The English 'began as it ended before,' explicitly adds a temporal link by stating the conversation 'began as it ended before,' enhancing the narrative continuity in a way not present in the source.","The French 'elle dédaigna d'en parler une seconde fois' (she disdained to speak of it a second time) is concise. The English 'she wou'd not be at the pains to re-assume any thing of what had pass'd' elaborates on 'parler une seconde fois' by adding 'to re-assume any thing of what had pass'd,' specifying the Marquise's reluctance to review previously discussed material in more detail.","The French 'voyci ce qui m'a mis du côté des Habitans de la Lune' (here is what has put me on the side of the inhabitants of the Moon) is a direct presentational statement. The English 'I'll tell you my Reasons that make me take part with the Inhabitants of the Moon:' reframes this by adding the explicit authorial intention 'I'll tell you my Reasons that make me take part,' making the transition more discursive and personal.","The French 'Il y aura quelqu'un' (There will be someone) is general. The English 'some body standing by,' adds the spatial detail 'standing by,' providing a more vivid image of the scene not present in the source.","The French 'qu'il pourrait bien encore ressembler à Paris pour ce qui est d'être habité' (that it might well also resemble Paris as far as being inhabited is concerned) focuses on the similarity of being inhabited. The English 'and that it might resemble Paris in every thing else, and be inhabited as well as it' adds 'in every thing else,' thereby broadening the scope of resemblance beyond what is specified in the source.","The French 'Tout cela' (All that) refers implicitly to the preceding counterpoints. The English 'All these Arguments' makes this reference explicit by adding the noun phrase 'these Arguments,' thereby clarifying the anaphoric link for the reader.","The French 'Saint-Denis est tout fait comme Paris' (Saint-Denis is entirely made like Paris / just like Paris) expresses a strong similarity. The English 'St. Denis is so like to Paris in every thing' adds 'in every thing,' explicitly amplifying the extent of the resemblance for emphasis.","The French 'Prenez garde, Madame' (Take care, Madam) is a general caution. The English 'Have a care, Madam, what you say;' adds the specific object of her caution, 'what you say,' making the warning more direct and focused on her statement.","The French 's'il faut que la Lune ressemble en tout à la Terre' (if it must be that the Moon resembles the Earth in everything) presents an impersonal condition. The English 'if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth' introduces the speaker's agency ('if I make it appear') in demonstrating this resemblance, an element of personal involvement not explicit in the French.","The French 'Les deux mouvements de la Terre' means 'The two movements of the Earth.' The English 'The two different Motions of the Earth' adds the adjective 'different,' explicitly clarifying that the movements are distinct, a nuance not overtly stated in the source though contextually implied.","The French 'me rendent timide sur tout le reste' (make me timid about all the rest) describes a general apprehension. The English 'make me very apprehensive of all you say' specifies the cause of this apprehension by adding 'of all you say,' focusing her fear on the speaker's pronouncements, which is a more targeted explanation than the broader French phrase.","The French '& il faut que la Terre renvoye aussi...' (and it must be that the Earth also sends back...) expresses a logical necessity or strong inference. The English 'as the Earth, without doubt, reflects it back...' adds the phrase 'without doubt,' inserting an explicit assertion of certainty from the narrator's perspective, which is stronger than the inferential tone of the French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere du Soleil?

La moitié de la Lune qui se trouva tournée vers nous au commencement du Monde, y a toûjours eté tournée depuis; elle ne nous présente jamais que ces yeux, cette bouche, &amp; le reste de ce visage que notre imagination luy compose <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">sur le fondement des tâches qu'elle nous montre</span></span>. Si l'autre moitié opposée se presentoit à nous, d'autres tâches differemment arrangées, nous feroient sans doute imaginer quelque autre figure. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Ce n'est pas que la Lune ne tourne sur elle-même, elle y tourne en autant de temps qu'autour de la Terre, c'est à dire, en un mois</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">mais lors qu'elle fait une partie de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">ce tremblement, &amp; de s'imaginer que nous avons dans le Ciel comme un mouvement de Pendule qui va &amp; vient.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>P026: Toutes ces Planètes, dit la Marquise, sont faites <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">comme nous</span></span>, qui rejetons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mêmes. La Terre dit: Ce n'est pas moy qui tourne, c'est le Soleil. La Lune dit, _Ce n'est pas moy qui tremble, c'est la Terre. Il y a bien de l'erreur par tout. Je ne vous conseille pas d'entreprendre d'y rien réformer, répondis-je, il vaut mieux que vous acheviez de vous convaincre de l'entiere ressemblance de la Terre &amp; de la Lune. Représentez-vous ces deux grandes Boules suspendües dans les Cieux. Vous savez que le Soleil éclaire toûjours une moitié des Corps qui sont ronds, &amp; que l'autre moitié est dans l'ombre. Il y a donc toûjours une moitié, tant de la Terre que de la Lune, qui est éclairée du Soleil, c'est à dire, qui a le jour, &amp; une autre moitié qui est dans la nuit. Remarquez d'ailleurs que comme <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">une Balle a moins de force &amp; de vitesse après qu'elle a été donner contre une muraille qui l'a renvoyée d'un autre côté</span></span>, de même la lumière s'affoiblit lors qu'elle a été réfléchie par quelque Corps. Cette lumière blanchâtre qui nous vient de la Lune, est la lumière même du Soleil, mais elle ne peut venir de la Lune à nous que par une réflexion. Elle a donc beaucoup perdu de la force &amp; de la vivacité qu'elle avoit lorsqu'elle étoit receüe directement sur la Lune, &amp; cette lumière éclatante que nous recevons du Soleil &amp; que la Terre reflechit sur la Lune, ne doit plus être qu'une lumiere blanchâtre quand elle y est arrivée. Ainsi ce qui nous paroit lumineux dans la Lune, &amp; qui nous éclaire pendant nos nuits, ce sont des parties de la Lune qui ont le jour; &amp; les parties de la Terre qui ont le jour lors qu'elles sont tournées vers les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit les éclairent aussi. Tout dépend de la manière dont la Lune &amp; la Terre se regardent. Dans les premiers jours du mois que l'on ne voit pas la Lune, c'est qu'elle est entre le Soleil &amp; nous, &amp; qu'elle marche de jour avec le Soleil. Il faut necessairement que toute sa moitié qui a le jour, soit tournée vers le Soleil, &amp; que toute sa moitié qui a la nuit, soit tournée vers nous. Nous n'avons garde de voir cette moitié qui n'a aucune lumière pour se faire voir. Mais cette moitié de la Lune qui a la nuit, étant tournée vers la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, nous voit sans être veüe, &amp; nous voit sous la même figure que nous voyons la Pleine Lune. C'est alors pour les Gens de la Lune Pleine Terre, s'il est permis de parler ainsi. Ensuite la Lune qui avance sur son Cercle d'un mois, se dégage de dessous le Soleil, &amp; commence à tourner vers nous un petit coin de sa moitié éclairée, &amp; voilà le Croissant. Alors aussi les parties de la Lune qui ont la nuit commencent à ne plus voir toute la moitié de la Terre qui a le jour, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">&amp; nous sommes en Décours pour elles.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P019: But, said the Marquiese, is the Earth as proper for reflecting the Light of the Sun, as the Moon?

Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus très sages, étaient pourtant bien pleines, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">&amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientôt aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune.</span></span> Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà.</span></span> Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui étoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland.</span></span> Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly? Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut. En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Mais pour achever de m'ôter le mien, dites-moy, &amp; dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune</span></span>; car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une manière assez positive. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">Moi, repris- je. Je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune.</span></span> Voyez combien la face de la Nature est changée d'icy à la Chine; d'autres Visages, d'autres Figures, d'autres Moeurs, &amp; presque d'autres Principes de raisonnement. D'icy à la Lune le changement doit être bien plus considerable. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve</span></span>; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">qui pourrait pousser jusqu'à la Lune, assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit.</span></span> </p><p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience? De bonne foy, Madame, repliquay-je, je n'en say rien. S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, &amp; que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; &amp; si d'ailleurs nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eût ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures qu'on appelle le Genre humain? Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eût des passions si folles, &amp; des reflexions si sages; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">une durée si courte, &amp; des veües si longues</span></span>, tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, &amp; tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, &amp; tant d'inclination à la Servitude</span></span>; une si forte envie d'être heureux, &amp; une si grande incapacité de l'être? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">Il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela.</span></span></span></span> Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mêmes, &amp; nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">On a eté réduit à dire que les Dieux etoient plein de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">&amp; que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sang froid, ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire.</span></span> Nous voila donc bien en seureté du côté des Gens de la Lune, dit la Marquise, ils ne nous devineront pas; mais je voudrais que nous les pussions deviner, car en verité cela inquiete, de savoir qu'ils sont là-haut, dans cette Lune que nous voyons, &amp; de ne pouvoir pas se figurer comment ils sont faits. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">Et pourquoi, rêpondis-je, n'avez-vous point d'inquietude sur les Habitans de cette grande Terre Australe qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe?</span></span> Nous sommes portés eux &amp; nous sur un même Vaisseau dont ils occupent la Proüe, &amp; nous la Pouppe. Vous voyez que de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, &amp; qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font, &amp; vous voudriez savoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux? </p><p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien.</span></span> Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu.</span></span></span></span> Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\">Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition?</span></span> Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes.</span></span> Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"29\">mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou.</span></span> Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"31\">mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller.</span></span> On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"32\">Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"33\">Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"34\">Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent</span></span>; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise. Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"35\">Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier.</span></span> Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"36\">Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune.</span></span> Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"37\">je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"38\">pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit</span></span>, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"39\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"40\">Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves.</span></span></span></span> Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois. Ah! vous me soulagez, répliqua la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"41\">votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal</span></span>, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of.</p> <p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">waiting and depending on promising States-men</span></span>, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and Dedications</span></span> one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse.</p> <p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</p> <p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</p> <p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts</span></span>; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">and Liberty of Conscience</span></span>, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of. </p><p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Mountains, Plains, Groves</span></span>, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">and Grandure</span></span>, Infinity of hopes, time <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or</span></span> thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">and Dedications</span></span> one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Astolpho told me</span></span> this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">and penetrating</span></span> Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">as full as any</span></span> since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">I am perswading you to believe</span></span>, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">seven Years</span></span> after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse. </p><p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">your Cruelties</span></span> must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips. </p><p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">on something that is worthy of 'em</span></span>; but <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">to accomplish this, and</span></span> rid me of mine. </p><p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">but some other odd sort of Creatures:</span></span> Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">of America, &amp;c.</span></span> and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">and Women</span></span> there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">beyond it</span></span>; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">and Slavery</span></span>; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">and Judgment</span></span> in the Inhabitants of the Moon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition</span></span>; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">of old amongst the Heathens</span></span>, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">at the ridiculousness of their handy Work</span></span>. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">under and near</span></span> the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts</span></span>; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">as they thought</span></span>, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\">the Indians</span></span> wou'd never have believ'd <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility:</span></span> nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">while the wondring Indians cried</span></span>, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\">and Thunder</span></span>? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"29\">and pass'd through</span></span>? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">earnestly</span></span> on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"31\">if we cou'd support our selves</span></span>.

Madam' to the philosopher's response, a common English conversational softener not present in the direct French reply.","The translator inserted 'at that time,' when describing the Moon inhabitants' early flying attempts ('knew how to make little Journeys'), placing this initial capability in the past, contrasting with 'and are now practising,' a nuance not in the source's more continuous timeframe.","The translator expanded on 'pour le fortifier' (to strengthen it [the reasoning]) by adding 'and make all good,' suggesting the philosopher can not only reinforce his arguments but also somehow validate them or conclusively prove their soundness.","The translator added 'and secrets of Nature' to 'The World,' broadening the scope of future discoveries beyond just the geographical or spatial unfolding of 'the World' mentioned in the source.","The translator added 'by strength of Argument' to specify the means by which a 'chimerical Opinion' can be defended ('assez bien soûtenir' - sustain/defend well enough), making the philosopher's rhetorical method explicit.","The translator elaborated on 'une personne d'esprit' (a person of wit/mind) by using the more formal, elaborate, and complimentary phrase 'a Person of your Understanding and Sense,' directly flattering the Marquise.","The translator added 'the Ornaments of' before 'all its convincing Proofs,' suggesting that truth, unlike elaborate arguments, does not need decorative or superfluous displays to be persuasive.","The translator added the adjective 'convincing' to 'Proofs,' emphasizing the inherent power and efficacy of truthful evidence, even when not fully presented.","The translator added 'confound and' before 'incommode me,' strengthening the description of the negative effect the philosopher's 'false way of arguing' had on the Marquise, making her discomfort more pronounced."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.

Nous ne manquâmes pas à aller le soir dans le Parc, qui devenoit un lieu consacré à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">nos Conversations savantes</span></span>. </p><p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences êtoit habitée, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">pourroit bien ne l'être point</span></span>; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril. Je ne souffriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'hui ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">la peine que j'y avois</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">je les croiray.</span></span> Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Je ne me paie point de Sentences</span></span>, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune</span></span> comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Qui verroit la Terre</span></span> de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">sur sa surface</span></span>, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">un endroit obscur</span></span>, &amp; deviendrait <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">plus lumineux</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">dès qu'il serait découvert</span></span>. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">s'assembleroient diversement</span></span>, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle</span></span>; mais tout au contraire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours</span></span>, &amp; voilà le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">de dessus la Lune</span></span>. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">par la chaleur</span></span>. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux?</span></span> Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">de grandes cavitez</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">De la distance où nous sommes</span></span>, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune; conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plutôt, s'il se peut, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">j'ay pris pour eux une inclination</span></span> que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je</span></span>, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">l'apparence des taches de la Lune</span></span> ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur</span></span> qui les a resserrées, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">renduës visibles</span></span> par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\">de gros nüages</span></span> qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">retombet en pluyes</span></span>. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles</span></span>, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\">des rosées tres subtiles</span></span>, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">par l'action du Soleil sur elles</span></span>; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"31\">ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors</span></span>.) <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"32\">Il se peut donc <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"33\">que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages</span></span>, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulem</span></span>ent en rosées. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"34\">Il suffit pour cela que</span></span> l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"35\">ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable</span></span>. Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"36\">voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"37\">Cela nous fournira</span></span> des fruits, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"38\">des blés</span></span>, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"39\">J'entends des fruits, des bleds, des eaux à la maniere de la Lune que je fais profession de ne pas connoître</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"40\">le tout proportionné aux besoins de ses Habitans</span></span>, que je ne connais pas non plus. </p><p>P041: C'est-à-dire, me dit la Marquise, que vous savez seulement que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"41\">tout est bien</span></span>, sans savoir comment il est; c'est beaucoup d'ignorance sur bien peu de science; mais il faut s'en consoler; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"42\">je suis encore trop heureuse</span></span> que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"43\">vous ayez rendu à la Lune ses Habitans</span></span>. Je suis même fort contente que vous luy donniez un Air qui l'enveloppe en son particulier, il me semblerait desormais que sans cela une Planete seroit trop nuë.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P031: MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but I told her, 'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them. We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">And if it were possible for any one to see and consider</span></span> the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">as the Earth</span></span> is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">without Variation or Change</span></span>; there lies the difficulty: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and by consequence</span></span>, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">but deep Caverns</span></span>, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">at from the Moon</span></span>. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and a Kindness</span></span> for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">small Dew</span></span>, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling. It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">(for certainly it emits Vapours;)</span></span> and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain: And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence</span></span>; so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">with a little Knowledge</span></span>; but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">MY Lady</span></span> Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but I told her, 'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them.

I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">obscure and enlightened places</span></span> of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">Airs, as they ascend,</span></span> by it are condensed, and render'd visible <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">to us</span></span>, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\">thick and black</span></span> Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">upon the Earth</span></span> in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">are extended, and kept from joining together</span></span>, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\">a kind of small</span></span> Dew, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling.

The word 'Entertainment' is an addition that shifts the nuance, suggesting the conversations are not only learned but also a source of amusement or enjoyable diversion.","The phrase 'now I begin to think,' is added before the translation of 'pourroit bien ne l'être point' (might well not be so), explicitly introducing the speaker's evolving thought process, which is less direct in the source.","The translator elaborates on 'la peine que j'y avois' (the trouble/difficulty I had with it) by adding the clause 'my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion,' which specifies the source and nature of the Marquise's initial reluctance, a detail not present in the French.","The phrase 'and now I am resolv'd' is added before the translation of 'je les croiray' (I will believe them/in them), emphasizing a deliberate decision-making process on the part of the Marquise.","The French 'Je ne me paie point de Sentences' (I don't content myself with/I'm not fobbed off with maxims/platitudes) is rendered with the added concepts of being 'deluded' and 'with fair Words,' which interpret and expand the original meaning.","The phrase 'of the Inhabitants' is added to 'the Moon' to specify the subject of reasoning, making explicit what is implied in the French 'raisonner de la Lune' (reason about the Moon).","To the French 'Qui verroit la Terre' (Whoever would see the Earth), the translator adds the verb 'and consider,' expanding the action beyond mere sight to include contemplation.","The phrase 'as to the appearance of' is added before 'its Surface' (translating 'sur sa surface'), providing a more formal and analytical tone to the description.","The word 'endroit' (place) is translated as 'part of the Globe,' with 'part of the Globe' being an addition that makes the reference to the Earth as a whole more explicit.","The French 'plus lumineux' (more luminous/brighter) is rendered as 'clear and enlightned.' The addition of 'clear and' creates a doublet, possibly for emphasis or to broaden the description.","The French 'dès qu'il serait découvert' (as soon as it would be uncovered) is made more specific by the addition 'as soon as these Clouds dis-appear,' which names the agent ('Clouds') and the action ('dis-appear').","The French 's'assembleroient diversement' (would assemble themselves variously/differently) is translated with the added phrase 'in different Figures,' which specifies the manner of assembly.","The comparative phrase 'as the Earth is' is added after 'were it encompass'd with Clouds,' explicitly drawing a parallel with Earth's clouds that is not directly stated in this clause in the source.","The phrase 'without Variation or Change' is added to reinforce the description of the Moon's features as 'fixes' (fixed) and 'toûjours' (always) the same, elaborating on their unchanging nature.","The word 'Globe of' is added in the translation 'Globe of the Moon' for 'de dessus la Lune' (from upon the Moon), specifying the Moon as a spherical body.","The phrase 'of the Sun' is added to 'by the heat' (translating 'par la chaleur'), explicitly identifying the source of the heat, which is contextually understood but not stated in the French phrase.","The French text poses one rhetorical question about the inhabitants. The translator adds a second, distinct question, 'Or what living Creatures can subsist,' to further emphasize the supposed uninhabitability of the Moon due to lack of water and produce.","The French 'de grandes cavitez' (large cavities) is translated and significantly expanded to 'deep Caverns, and vast Cavities,' adding descriptive intensity and detail through the choice of 'deep Caverns' and the additional phrase 'and vast Cavities'.","The phrase 'from the Moon' is added to 'at the great distance we are at,' explicitly stating the reference point of the distance, which is implied in the French 'De la distance où nous sommes.'","The French 'une inclination' (an inclination/liking) is translated and expanded with 'and a Kindness,' adding a distinct, though related, emotional nuance to the Marquise's feelings for the Moon's inhabitants.","The polite term of address 'Madam' is added when the narrator speaks to the Marquise, a common feature in English dialogues of the period for formal politeness not explicitly present in the French dialogue structure here.","The French 'l'apparence des taches de la Lune' (the appearance of the Moon's spots) is rendered as 'the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon.' The phrase 'obscure and enlightened places' is an interpretative expansion of 'taches.'","The French 'une froideur' (a coldness) is specified as 'cold Airs,' and the phrase 'as they ascend,' is added to provide context for when and how vapours encounter this coldness.","The word 'to us' is added to 'render'd visible' (translating 'renduës visibles'), specifying for whom the vapours become visible.","The French 'de gros nüages' (large clouds) is rendered more descriptively as 'thick and black Clouds,' with 'thick and black' being added attributes.","The phrase 'upon the Earth' is added to 'fall...in Rain' (translating 'retombet en pluyes'), specifying the destination of the rainfall which is implied in the French.","The French 'se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées' (sometimes remain quite dispersed) is elaborated as 'are extended, and kept from joining together,' providing a more detailed description of the vapours' state.","The French 'des rosées tres subtiles' (very subtle dews) is translated as 'a kind of small Dew.'

Later, describing these dews further, 'insensible' is added before 'Dews', qualifying them in a way not specified in 'rosées'.","The introductory framing 'to demonstrate this, to conjecture only' is added before the explanation of air and vapours, setting a specific logical or methodological context for the statement that is not explicitly in the French 'Il suffit pour cela que...'.","The phrase 'to be true' is added to 'more than likely' (translating 'quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable'), making the assertion about the hypothesis more direct and conclusive.","The French 'voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, & nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance' (there are its inhabitants reborn, & we have the necessary basis for their subsistence) is rephrased so that 'external Causes' are now described with the added function: 'which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food'.

The translator adds 'and Commerce' to specify a particular type of interaction, potentially economic or social exchange, thereby clarifying and perhaps narrowing the scope of 'communication' for the English reader, or making an implied aspect explicit.","The source's phrase 'comme je vous disois hier' (as I was telling you yesterday) refers generally to a past conversation. The target text elaborates this into 'in that Art I discours'd of last Night.' The addition of 'in that Art' specifies flying as the subject of the prior discussion, and 'last Night' refines 'hier'. This provides more explicit context and links the past discourse more directly to the current topic of perfecting flight.","The original work is a dialogue with a Marquise. The translator adds 'Madam' to the philosopher's statement 'J'avoüe pourtant qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup d'apparence.' This addition makes the dialogic nature explicit by directly addressing her, maintains a polite and formal tone appropriate for the characters, and enhances naturalness for the English reader.","Fontenelle uses 'air' metaphorically in 'L'eau est l'air des Poissons' to mean the vital medium for fish. The translator adds 'and Element' to clarify this metaphorical use, making it more explicit for the English reader that water is the natural environment or life-sustaining substance for fish, not just 'air' in a literal sense.","Consistent with the previous clarification, 'and Element' is added when referring to the medium of birds. The source phrase 'ils ne passent jamais dans l'Air des Oiseaux' (they never pass into the Air of Birds) is expanded in the target to 'who never pass into the Air and Element of Birds,' reinforcing the idea of a specific, life-sustaining environment for birds, parallel to that of fish, and making the analogy clearer.","The French 'se noyeroit' (from 'un Habitan de la Lune ... se noyeroit...') translates to 'would drown.' The translator adds 'and suffocated' to elaborate on the consequence of Moon inhabitants entering Earth's air. This provides a more precise physiological explanation, as 'drowning' in air might be less clear than 'suffocating,' especially given the context of different atmospheric compositions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P043: Oh, que j'aurois d'envie, s'écria la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">qu'il arrivât quelque grand naufrage qui répandît icy bon nombre de ces Gens- là</span></span>, dont nous irions considérer à notre aise les figures extraordinaires!

Consider, said I, that you wou'd be very weak and feeble, before you come to the Surface of our Air; for we cannot breath it in all its Extent, and we can hardly live on the Tops of high Mountains; and I wonder that those who are so foolish as to believe, that Corporeal Geniuses inhabit the purest Air, do not tell us why these Geniuses visit us so seldom, and stay so short a while: I do believe, 'tis because few amongst 'em know how to dive; and that even those who are skilful in that Art, have great difficulty to penetrate the grossness of the Air which we breath. You see therefore, that Nature has set many Bars and Fences, to hinder us from going out of our World, into that of the Moon. However, for our Satisfaction, let us conjecture and guess as much as we can of that world: For Example; I fansie that the Inhabitants of the Moon must see the Heavens, the Sun, and the Stars, of a different Colour than what they appear to us. All these Objects we see through a kind of natural Perspective-Glass, which changes them to us; this Perspective-glass of ours is mix'd with Vapours and Exhalations, which do not ascend very high. Some of late pretend, that the Air of it self is blew, as well as the Water of the Sea; and that that Colour is not apparent in the one, nor the other, but at a great depth: The Heavens, say they, in which are plac'd the fixed Stars, has of it self no Light; and by consequence, ought to appear black: But we see it through our Air, which is blew; and therefore the Heavens appear of that Colour. If it be so, the Beams of the Sun and Stars cannot pass through the Air, without taking a little of its Tincture, and at the same time lose as much of their own natural Colour: But supposing the Air had no Colour of it self, 'tis certain, that a Flambeau, seen at a distance, through a thick Fog, appears of a reddish Colour, tho' that be not natural to it; so all our Air, which is nothing else but a thick Fog, must certainly alter the true natural Colour of the Heavens, Sun and Stars to us; for nothing but the pure heavenly Substance is capable to convey to us Light and Colours, in their Purity <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and Perfection</span></span>, as they are: So that the Air of the Moon is of another nature than our Air, or is, of it self, of an indifferent Colour; or, at least, is another Fog, changing, in appearance, the Colours of the Celestial Bodies.

Consider, said I, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">that you wou'd be very weak and feeble, before you come to the Surface of our Air</span></span>; for we cannot breath it in all its Extent, and we can hardly live on the Tops of high Mountains; and I wonder that those who are so foolish as to believe, that Corporeal Geniuses inhabit the purest Air, do not tell us why these Geniuses visit us so seldom, and stay so short a while: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">I do believe, 'tis because few amongst 'em know how to dive</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">and that even those who are skilful in that Art, have great difficulty to penetrate the grossness of the Air which we breath.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">You see therefore, that Nature has set many Bars and Fences</span></span>, to hinder us from going out of our World</span></span>, into that of the Moon. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">However, for our Satisfaction, let us conjecture and guess as much as we can of that world:</span></span> For Example; I fansie that the Inhabitants of the Moon must see the Heavens, the Sun, and the Stars, of a different Colour than what they appear to us. All these Objects we see through a kind of natural Perspective-Glass, which changes them to us; this Perspective-glass of ours is mix'd with Vapours and Exhalations, which do not ascend very high. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Some of late pretend, that the Air of it self is blew</span></span>, as well as the Water of the Sea; and that that Colour is not apparent in the one, nor the other, but at a great depth: The Heavens, say they, in which are plac'd the fixed Stars, has of it self no Light; and by consequence, ought to appear black: But we see it through our Air, which is blew; and therefore the Heavens appear of that Colour. If it be so, the Beams of the Sun and Stars cannot pass through the Air, without taking a little of its Tincture, and at the same time lose as much of their own natural Colour: But supposing the Air had no Colour of it self, 'tis certain, that a Flambeau, seen at a distance, through a thick Fog, appears of a reddish Colour, tho' that be not natural to it; so all our Air, which is nothing else but a thick Fog, must certainly alter the true natural Colour of the Heavens, Sun and Stars to us; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">for nothing but the pure heavenly Substance is capable to convey to us Light and Colours, in their Purity and Perfection, as they are:</span></span> So that the Air of the Moon is of another nature than our Air, or is, of it self, of an indifferent Colour; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">or, at least, is another Fog, changing, in appearance, the Colours of the Celestial Bodies.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">In short, if there be Inhabitants in the Moon, they see all things chang'd, through their Perspective-glasses, which is their Air.</span></span></span></span></p>","explanations":["The translator adds 'occasion'd by a mighty Tempest' to elaborate on the cause of the shipwreck, providing a more vivid image than the source's 'quelque grand naufrage' (some great shipwreck). This addition specifies the agent of the shipwreck, which is not present in the source.","The French 'bien malade' (very ill/sick) is translated and expanded to 'very weak and feeble.' While 'weak' can be a consequence of illness, the addition of 'and feeble' provides further descriptive detail, emphasizing the physical debilitation not explicitly itemized in the source.","The translator introduces the phrase 'I do believe,' which is absent in the source's more direct statement 'c'est que...' (it is that...). This addition injects a subjective perspective from the narrator, slightly altering the epistemic tone of the assertion.","The source's 'ceux-là même' (even those/them) is elaborated in the target text with the clause 'who are skilful in that Art'. This addition specifies a characteristic of the individuals being discussed (their skill in diving), providing context not explicitly stated in the source.","The source 'Voilà donc bien des barrieres naturelles' (So there are many natural barriers) is rendered as 'You see therefore, that Nature has set many Bars...'. The phrase 'that Nature has set' introduces 'Nature' as an active agent creating these barriers, an explicit attribution of agency not present in the source's 'natural barriers'.","The French 'barrieres' (barriers) is translated as 'Bars and Fences.' While 'Bars' is a suitable translation, the addition of 'and Fences' creates a doublet, likely for emphasis or to offer a more comprehensive or culturally resonant image of obstacles for the English reader.","The French verb 'deviner' (to guess/surmise/divine) is rendered as 'conjecture and guess.' 'Guess' alone could translate 'deviner'; the addition of 'conjecture' introduces a slightly more formal or intellectual nuance to the act of speculation, possibly to align with the philosophical tone.","The source 'Quelques Modernes' (Some Moderns) is translated as 'Some of late.' While 'Moderns' implies recency, the addition of 'of late' makes this temporal aspect more explicit and emphatic, perhaps to stress the contemporary nature of these theories for the target audience.","The French phrase 'dans toute leur pureté' (in all their purity) is expanded in the target text to 'in their Purity and Perfection.' The addition of 'and Perfection' enhances the description of the ideal state of light and colors, adding a qualitative aspect not explicitly mentioned in the source.","The source states that the fog 'cause une autre alteration aux couleurs' (causes another alteration to the colors). The target text refines this by stating it is 'changing, in appearance, the Colours.' The addition 'in appearance,' clarifies that the alteration is perceptual rather than intrinsic, a specific nuance added by the translator.","The source's phrase 'à l'égard des Gens de la Lune' (regarding the People of the Moon) presupposes their existence for the sake of the argument. The target text introduces 'if there be Inhabitants in the Moon,', transforming the presupposition into an explicit condition, thus adding a layer of doubt or hypothesis not as strongly conveyed in the source.","The translator adds the clause 'which is their Air' to explicitly identify what 'their Perspective-glasses' refers to. While the source implies this connection through context, this addition provides direct clarification for the reader, ensuring the analogy is understood."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P045: Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy.

The source's 'n'est pas si agreable' means 'is not so agreeable'.","The translator added 'for a Room' to provide a specific context for 'Furniture' (meuble), which is more general in the source text.","The translator expanded 'un habit' (an outfit/garment) to the more elaborate 'a Garniture for a Suit of Cloths'. 'Suit of Cloths' specifies the type of 'habit', and 'a Garniture for' introduces the idea of trimmings or accessories, which is an elaboration.","The translator added 'agreeable to the Inhabitants of' to make explicit that the colors are intended to be pleasing to the Moon's inhabitants. The source 'pour la Lune' (for the Moon) is less explicit in this regard.","The translator added 'perfectly' as an intensifier to 'well understood,' making the assurance stronger than the source's 'bien entendu' (well understood).","The translator expanded 'à chaque point de veüe diferent' (at each different point of view) into the more descriptive phrase 'according to the different Situation and Position of the Beholders,' clarifying what constitutes a 'point of view' by specifying the observer's physical state and location.","The translator added 'new and' before 'agreeable way.' The source 'd'une manière toûjours agreable' means 'in an always agreeable manner.' The addition introduces the concept of novelty alongside agreeableness.","The translator made the referent of 'son' (her) in 'son adresse' (her skill) explicit by adding 'of Nature'. Additionally, 'perfectly well' was added to intensify 'know' (reconnois - I recognize/acknowledge), making the acknowledgement of Nature's skill more emphatic.","The translator elaborated on 'pour chaque point de veûe' (for each point of view) by rephrasing it as 'as to the several Points' and adding the explanatory clause 'from whence they may be seen,' clarifying the nature of these points.","The translator added the clause 'through which they are seen' to explain the function of the 'Perspective-glasses' (Lunettes - glasses/telescope), a detail not explicitly stated in the source.","The translator added the phrase 'with an Air of the same Colour' to the description of the Moon's environment.

The source focuses on 'les Belles de ce Pays-là' (the Beauties of that country) and the general loss of comparisons related to them, while the target specifies actors and a romantic context.","The translator adds the explicit clarification 'without these two things?' to specify what is lacking for comparisons (the aurora and rainbow).

They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another. You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other? Seriously, said I, Madam, 'twould be a great Pleasure and Satisfaction to see several different Worlds; and I am often glad, to make these Journeys in Imagination; what joy then it wou'd be to do it in reality; that wou'd be far better than to travel from hence to Iapan, crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again. Well, said she, what hinders, but we shou'd make a Journey through the Planets as well as we can? Let us by imagination place our selves in several Positions, and situations, fit for considering the Universe. Have we no more to see in the Moon? No, said I, at least, I have shown you all I know. Going out of the Moon towards the Sun, the first Planet you meet with is Venus; and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis. Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">as the Moon does round the Earth</span></span>; and by the means of Telescopes, we discover that Venus waxes and wanes, being sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened according to her different Positions in respect to the Earth.</p> <p>P037: By all appearance the Moon is inhabited, why shou'd not Venus be so, as well as she? Ay, but interrupted the Marquiese by your why nots, you will people all the Planets. Do not doubt of it, Madam, answer'd I; why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all? We see that all the Planets are of the same Nature, that they are all Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun; which they send one to another by Reflection, and that they have all the same kind of motion; thus far equal, and after all this must we conceive that all these vast Bodies were made not to be inhabited? And that Nature has made only an exception in Favor of the Earth, he that will believe this, may, but for my part I cannot. I find you, said the Marquiese, very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited. It is true, Madam, in the minute wherein you have surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me, as to the Inhabitants of all the Planets, I wou'd not only have defended my opinion, but have proceeded, to have given you an exact description of all the several Inhabitants of the Planets. There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it. The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there. And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates. If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,) and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures. Several Bodies, which appear to be solid, are nothing else but Collections or little heaps of these imperceptible Animals; who find there as much room, as is requisite for them to move in. The leaf of a Tree, is a little World inhabited, by such invisible little Worms: To them this leaf seems of a vast Extent, they find Hills and Valleys upon it: And there is no more Communication between the living Creatures on the one side, and those on the other, than between us and the Antipodes. And I think there is more reason, to believe a Planet (which is so vast a Body) to be inhabited. There has been found in several sorts of very hard Stones, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">infinite multitudes</span></span> of little Worms, lodg'd all over them in insensible varieties; and who are nourish'd upon the Substance of these Stones which they eat. Consider the vast Numbers of these little Animals, and how long a tract of Years they have liv'd upon a grain of Sand. And by this Argument, tho my Moon were nothing but a confus'd heap of Marble Rocks, I wou'd rather make it be devour'd and consum'd by its Inhabitants, than to place none at all in it.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P036: I do much regret that loss, said the Marquiese, for in my Opinion, the Inhabitants of the Moon are fully recompens'd <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">for the want of the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light,</span></span> since for the same Reason, they have neither Thunder nor Lightning, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">both which are produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations;</span></span> they enjoy bright serene Days, and never lose the Sun by Day, nor the Stars by Night.

It likely serves to summarize previous arguments or to establish a philosophical context for the English-speaking audience, emphasizing Earth's abundant life to support the hypothesis of life on other planets.","The translator added 'strangely' to 'embarass'd,' intensifying the Marquise's feeling of confusion and making her reaction more vivid for the reader.","The translator added 'of Mankind' to clarify that 'tous les visages' (all faces) refers specifically to human faces, avoiding potential ambiguity.","The translator added 'of our Globe' to specify that the 'deux grandes Nations' (two great nations) being discussed are those on Earth, providing explicit geographical context.","The translator added the interjection 'Nay,' to introduce and emphasize the subsequent point, a common rhetorical device in English for adding an idea that reinforces or expands on the previous one.","The translator elaborated on the French 'trouver le modele des visages' (to find the model of faces) by describing this model as 'a certain resemblance and Air of the Countenance peculiar to' them, adding descriptive detail about the nature of family/racial resemblances.","The translator added 'or Race of Men' to expand on 'chaque Famille' (each family), broadening the concept to include racial distinctions or to clarify 'family' in a wider sense of lineage.","The translator added the introductory exclamation 'Yet it is wonderful to observe' and significantly elaborated 'en tant de manieres' (in so many ways) into the more specific and emphatic 'how many Millions of Times,' to underscore the vastness of nature's creativity and evoke a sense of awe.","The translator added 'of a Man' to 'visage' (face) for clarity, specifying that it refers to a human face, consistent with an earlier addition.","The translator added 'the Inhabitants of the Earth,' to explicitly identify 'Nous' (We), making the reference immediately clear for the reader.","The translator added 'peculiar to themselves;' to elaborate on 'un autre air' (another look/appearance), emphasizing the unique and distinct nature of the facial features of inhabitants of other planets.","The translator added the conjunction 'for' to create a clearer logical link between the preceding statement (differences increase with distance) and the illustrative example that follows, improving the argumentative flow.","The translator added 'together' to clarify that the hypothetical viewing of an inhabitant of the Earth and one of the Moon is for a simultaneous comparison.","The translator added 'Tongue and' to 'Voice,' specifying the physical organ associated with speech (the tongue), thereby providing a more concrete anatomical detail than the general 'voix'.","The translator replaced the concise 'ailleurs' (elsewhere) with the more descriptive phrase 'and in another Planet,' specifying the location, and added the modal 'it may be,' to soften the assertion into a possibility.","The translator added 'the Inhabitants' to provide an explicit subject for the verb 'speaks,' where the French uses the impersonal pronoun 'on' (one).","The translator added 'and made perfect' to 'is form'd' (se forme), suggesting that experience not only shapes reason but also refines it to a state of perfection.","The translator added 'to know' before 'what's to come' and 'what's past' (implied for the second instance), clarifying that the 'torment' or 'trouble' is specifically related to the desire for, or anxiety about, knowledge of future and past events.","The translator replaced 'plus loin' (further away/beyond) with the more specific 'In another Planet,' clarifying the context of the comparison.","The translator added 'now' to 'ignorant of,' providing temporal specificity to the state of human ignorance regarding certain things.","The translator added 'the Inhabitants of' when rephrasing the French. The source states 'Ce sixiéme Sens est apparemment dans quelque autre Monde' (This sixth Sense is apparently in some other World); the target's 'It may be the Inhabitants of some other Planet have this advantage' specifies who might possess this sense.","The translator reframed the original 'Ce sixiéme Sens est apparemment dans quelque autre Monde' (This sixth Sense is apparently in some other World) by stating that inhabitants 'have this advantage,' thereby characterizing the sixth sense as a benefit and focusing on its possession rather than its mere existence elsewhere.","The translator added 'other' before 'five we enjoy' to clearly distinguish these five senses from the potential sixth sense under discussion, enhancing precision.","The translator added 'more' to 'natural Senses,' implying these are additional to the known five senses, thus reinforcing the idea of a greater variety of senses beyond human experience.","The translator added 'in other Worlds' to specify the potential location of the 'great many more natural Senses,' providing context for this speculation.","The translator added 'yet' to 'cou'd never exceed,' subtly emphasizing that this limitation of human intellect holds true up to the present moment, possibly for rhetorical emphasis.","The translator replaced 'elles nous manquent tout à coup' (they [sciences] suddenly fail us) with 'our Ingenuity is at a stand,' personifying the limitation by attributing it to human intellectual capacity ('Ingenuity') rather than an abstract failure of 'sciences.'","The translator added 'it may be' to introduce a degree of speculation or possibility regarding the unknown nature of familiar things in other worlds, softening the assertion.","The translator elaborated 'ce que nous savons' (what we know) into the more descriptive phrase 'that are familiar to us,' providing a clearer sense of the known things being contrasted with their potential unknown status elsewhere.","The translator added 'altogether' to intensify 'unknown,' emphasizing the complete and total lack of knowledge of certain Earthly familiar things in other worlds.","The translator added 'delights of' before 'Love,' characterizing love positively and thereby making its absence in the other planet more poignant and significant.","The translator significantly elaborated on '& on s'ennuye' (and one gets bored / is bored) by adding the consequential clause 'which must render their Lives very irksom.' This addition explains the severe negative impact of lacking love on the inhabitants' lives, using stronger vocabulary.","The translator replaced 'entre les hommes' (among men) with 'to us Mortals,' making the statement more direct and personal to the reader, while also emphasizing human mortality.","The translator replaced 'pour la distribution du bonheur où des talens' (for the distribution of happiness or talents) with 'by making some happy, others miserable.' The phrase 'others miserable' introduces a specific negative state (misery) not explicitly present in the source, which speaks of distributing happiness or talents, thus adding a stronger contrasting element.","The translator added the conjunction 'Yet' to introduce a contrasting or emphatic point about Nature's consistent 'admirable Art' of diversification, despite other distributions.","The translator added the concessive clause 'tho she has made some equal in some respects,' which qualifies the idea of equality and compensation, making it more nuanced than the source's 'égaler' (to make equal). The phrase 'in some respects' is particularly additive.","The translator significantly elaborated on 'égaliser ... par les compensations' (to make equal ... through compensations) by explicitly detailing the mechanism: 'by compensating the want of any one thing, with another of equal value.' This provides a much clearer and more detailed explanation of how Nature's system of compensation and equalization functions."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux?

This makes the transition more explicit and dramatic than the source's simple conjunction '&' (and) combined with 'même' (even).","The translator expanded the French 'figures' (figures, forms) into the doublet 'shapes and figures.' This is a common rhetorical device in older English translations used for elaboration or emphasis.","The translator added 'fansie' to the verb phrase. While the source 'je voy' means 'I see,' the target 'I fansie I see' explicitly frames the Marquise's perception as an act of imagination or 'fancying,' a nuance not directly stated but contextually fitting.","The translator added 'here' to make the Marquise's vision more immediate and spatially defined ('I fansie I see 'em here'). This specific adverb of place is absent in the source, which generally states 'I see something.'","The translator added 'Madam,' a polite form of address. This was common in English dialogues of the period to enhance naturalness for the target audience, even though no direct vocative is present in the source's 'répliquay-je' (I replied).","The translator added 'to entertain you,' changing the stated purpose of the dreams. The source suggests 'd'en laisser le soin aux Songes' (to leave the care/responsibility of it to Dreams), focusing on the dreams' role in revealing the figures, while the target suggests the dreams will provide entertainment.","The translator replaced the source's concept of dreams teaching 'comment sont faits les Habitants' (how the Inhabitants are made/formed) with the idea that dreams will assist 'to describe the Inhabitants.' This addition shifts the focus from gaining knowledge of their nature to the ability to articulate or depict this knowledge, aligning with an earlier alteration in the text regarding the Marquise's ability to describe figures.","Similar to the first instance, the translator added 'other' to specify that the planet is distinct from Earth, providing slight additional clarity not explicitly present in 'de quelque Planete' (of some Planet)."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P054: QUATRIEME SOIR.

The translator adds \"of my Lady Marquiese\" to explicitly state whose dreams are being discussed, providing clarity for the English reader.","The source states that certain people only make bizarre and grotesque paintings. The target text adds a full explanatory clause (\"for they being ignorant...\") detailing their lack of skill and preference for such figures as a reason for their art and criticism, content not present in the source.","The source refers to \"Habitans\" (Inhabitants). The translator specifies this by using the phrase \"Animals that inhabit,\" effectively adding the concept \"Animals\" to narrow the meaning from general inhabitants to a specific biological category not explicitly stated in the source.","The source text mentions \"Voyage des Mondes\" (Voyage of the Worlds). The translator expands this to \"Worlds of the Universe,\" adding \"of the Universe\" to provide a grander scope or context, clarifying that these worlds are part of the larger cosmos.","The French \"en ce temps-là\" (in that time) refers to the previously mentioned duration of eight months. The English translation \"since Venus turns round the Sun\" already implies this. Adding \"in that space of time\" at the end of the clause is a redundant temporal marker, possibly for emphasis or rhythm, reiterating information already conveyed.","The source uses \"paroît\" (appears). The target strengthens this with \"must necessarily appear.\" The addition of \"must necessarily\" introduces a strong modal of obligation or certainty that is not present in the simple descriptive \"paroît,\" thereby intensifying the statement.","The French phrase \"de dedans Venus\" (from within Venus) implies an observer on Venus. The translator makes this explicit by adding \"to the Inhabitants of Venus,\" clarifying for whom the Earth would appear larger, a common normalization strategy.","The source text uses \"& comme\" (and as/since) to link the premise (Moon's size relative to Earth) to the conclusion (its appearance from Venus), implying a logical step.

The translator renders this as 'the lucky Star' and further adds 'of their Intrigues,' introducing a specific connotation of romantic scheming not explicitly present in the original phrase.","The source phrase 'presider aux Amours' (to preside over loves) is rendered as 'to give Laws to the Loves.' The addition 'to give Laws to' imputes a more directive and controlling influence to the Moon than the original 'preside.'","The source phrase 'doivent bien entendre la galanterie' (must be well versed in/understand gallantry well) is significantly elaborated into 'are very soft, and have the Art to please extreamly well.' This addition provides a more descriptive and romanticized characterization of the Venusians.","The translator added 'from its Influence' to explicitly state the causal link, clarifying that the brighter light and heat Venus receives are due to the Sun's influence, which is implicit in the source's 'elle en reçoit' (it receives from it [the Sun]).","The source states Venus receives 'plus de chaleur' (more heat).

The translator used 'Gentlemen' instead of a direct translation for 'Peuple,' adding a connotation of social class or refinement not explicitly in the source text.","The source lists Venusian activities as 'des Fêtes, des Danses, & des Tournois' (Festivals, Dances, and Tournaments).

This cultural substitution makes the concept more immediate and impactful for the contemporary English reader.","The translator elaborates on 'de très foibles Crépuscules' (very faint twilights) by adding 'the Remains of a saint' to 'Twi-light.' This addition introduces a specific, though somewhat unusual, characterization not present in the source, possibly to create a more striking image, even if 'saint' might be a misprint for 'faint'.","The source text 'peut-être n'y pourroient-ils pas distinguer les objets' (perhaps they could not distinguish objects there) is expanded. The target text adds 'the Light we enjoy, wou'd not serve them,' which specifies what is insufficient for the Mercurians to see, thereby clarifying the reason for their difficulty.","The translator adds 'enjoy'd by the Inhabitants' to the description of the warmth in Africa. This clarifies who experiences this warmth, making the comparison with Mercury's heat more explicit than the source's 'celle qu'il fait icy au fond de l'Afrique' (that [heat] which it is here in the depths of Africa).","The translator adds 'to death' to the verb 'frieze' (translating 'glacier' - to freeze). This intensifies the outcome, emphasizing the fatal effect of Earth's relative cold on Mercurians, making the statement more dramatic.","The French 'à toute l'adresse des Astronomes' (to all the skill/adroitness of Astronomers) is translated using the English doublet 'Art and Skill.' This common rhetorical device adds emphasis and lexical fullness not strictly present in the single French word 'adresse'.","The source's 'le mouvement qu'il doit avoir sur son centre' (the movement it must have on its center) is significantly elaborated. The addition 'the Time in which he performs his Revolution upon his own Axis or' specifies the nature of the astronomical observation (timing a rotation) and uses more formal and precise scientific terminology.","The translator adds the phrase ', to their Apprehension,' to clarify that the 'wonderful Rapidity' of the Sun's movement is perceived from the perspective of Mercury's inhabitants. This makes the subjective nature of the observation explicit.","The French 'ils soûpirent après la nuit' (they sigh for/long for the night) is rendered more emphatically by adding 'so earnestly' and specifying 'the coming' Night. These additions intensify the Mercurians' desire and make the object of their longing more distinct.","This entire clause, stating that night 'must be much more grateful to 'em than the Day,' is an addition by the translator. The source mentions Mercurians long for night but does not explicitly make this comparison or state this consequence, so the translator is elaborating on their presumed preference.","The source's general temporal phrase 'pendant ce temps-là' (during that time, referring to night) is made more descriptive by the addition of 'cooler Hours.' This specifies a qualitative aspect of the night on Mercury, implying relief from the intense daytime heat.","The French 'cette grande voûte' (this great vault) is expanded to the more poetic and descriptive 'the vast arch'd Roof of the Heavens.'

This addition helps to contextualize the dialogue for the reader as part of a guided tour.","The French 'Le Pourquoy non nous manque là' suggests the reasoning or justification for inhabitants is absent for the Sun. The translator makes the implication of this lack of justification more explicit by stating 'we are mistaken' if one were to apply the general rule (that similar bodies are inhabited) to the Sun. This clarifies the speaker's stance on the Sun's habitability.","The translator added 'and Fountain' as a stylistic doublet to 'Source.' This was a common rhetorical practice in English prose of the period, used to add emphasis, rhythm, or a sense of completeness to the description of the Sun as the origin of light.","The translator added 'and Violence' after 'Force,' creating another stylistic doublet. This intensifies the description of the Sun's emission of light, making the imagery more vivid and powerful for the English reader.","The translator added 'in the Air,' to specify the medium through which light rays are depicted as crossing and traversing. While potentially inaccurate for interplanetary space (which is a vacuum), this addition might reflect a common understanding or a simplification for the popular audience of the time, making the visual description more concrete.","The French 'Aussi' can mean 'also' or 'therefore.' The translator chose 'For this end' to make the teleological reasoning more explicit, emphasizing that the Sun's central position serves the specific purpose of distributing light and heat.","The translator added 'dispense and' before 'distribute,' creating a doublet. This stylistic choice enhances the description of the Sun's function, possibly for rhetorical emphasis or to lend a more formal tone to the prose.","The source text states the Sun animates 'par sa chaleur' (by its heat). The translator expanded this to 'his Light and Heat,' explicitly including light as one of the means by which the Sun animates its surroundings. This addition clarifies and completes the description of the Sun's influence, aligning with its role as the source of light.","The French 'animer' (to animate, enliven) is rendered partly as 'livening.' The translator added 'and enlightning,' specifying another crucial effect of the Sun. This complements the addition of 'Light' earlier and provides a fuller account of the Sun's functions.","The source describes the Sun as 'un Corps particulier' (a particular Body). The translator rendered this as 'a Body of a particular Substance,' adding 'Substance' to emphasize the unique material composition of the Sun, going beyond merely its form or type as a 'body'.","Following the previous addition, the question 'quelle sorte de Corps?' (what kind of Body?) is expanded in the translation to 'what kind of Body, or what kind of Substance,'. This addition maintains parallelism and further specifies the nature of the inquiry into the Sun's composition.","The source says 'the new Planets had come into fashion.' The translator elaborated on this by adding 'and Discourses of 'em,' specifying that public and scholarly conversations about these new planets were what became particularly fashionable. This gives more precise context to the intellectual excitement of the time.","The source 'Les Savans' (The Learned/Scholars) is translated as 'The learned Men of the World.' The addition 'of the World' slightly broadens the term, perhaps to convey a sense of the widespread community of scholars or simply as a conventional English elaborative phrase.","The source 'il s'épand' (it spreads/extends) describes the light more generally. The translator specified the mechanism as 'reflected,' which implies a particular mode of light propagation (bouncing off surfaces) between planets. This adds a layer of physical interpretation not explicitly in the original verb.","The source uses 'traînées' (trails/streaks). The translator expanded this to 'streams and streaks,' a stylistic doublet where 'streams and' is added to 'streaks' (a plausible translation of 'traînées'). This adds fullness to the description of light, typical of the translation style of the period."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

The translator has specified \"on\" as \"the Philosophers and learned Men,\" clarifying who was responsible for naming the parts of the Moon, presumably drawing from the context of \"Savants\" (learned men) mentioned immediately after in the source.","The source lists \"noms de Savants & d'Astronomes\" (names of Scholars/Scientists & Astronomers). The target translates this as \"Names of Philosophers, Astronomers and Mathematicians.\" \"Philosophers\" can be seen as a specification of \"Savants.\" The distinct addition is \"and Mathematicians,\" expanding the categories of learned individuals whose names were used.","The source refers to \"differentes parties de la Lune\" (different parts of the Moon). The translator uses \"several Countries of the Moon.\" The word \"Countries\" is an elaboration that likens lunar regions to terrestrial divisions, making the description more vivid for the English audience.","The source text uses \"les Savants\" (the learned/scientists). The translator has rendered this as \"Philosophers and Astronomers,\" specifying the types of \"Savants\" based on the earlier context of naming parts of the Moon. This explicitation adds clarity by reminding the reader which specific groups of learned people are being referred to.","The source states that \"les Savants\" (the learned/scientists) should reserve \"le Ciel\" (the Sky/Heaven) for themselves. The translator specifies \"le Ciel\" as \"the Moon and the Stars,\" making the domain of these scholars more concrete and directly relevant to the astronomical discussion.","The translator added \"What, ... Madam,\" to the philosopher's reply. \"Répondis-je\" (I replied) is simply rendered as \"said I\". The \"What,... Madam\" adds a conversational interjection and a direct address to the Marquise, enhancing the dialogic nature of the exchange.","The source lists \"des nuages, des fumées, des écumes\" (clouds, smokes, scums). The translation renders this as \"Clouds of Smoak and Vapours, and, as it were, a Scum\". \"Smoak\" translates \"fumées\". \"Clouds of Smoak\" could interpret \"nuages\" in this context. The addition of \"and Vapours\" expands the description of these solar phenomena, providing another related term for clarity or richness.","The source states \"quelquefois elles se séparent\" (sometimes they separate). The translator used the doublet \"dispers'd and dissipated.\" While \"dispers'd\" captures the meaning of \"se séparent,\" \"and dissipated\" is added for rhetorical emphasis or to provide a fuller sense of the spots vanishing.","The source says the Sun \"produit des impuretez, qui...sont rejettées sur sa surface\" (produces impurities, which...are cast upon its surface). The target translates \"Impuretez\" as \"Impurities\" earlier in the clause, but then elaborates on what is thrown to the surface as \"its Scum and Dross.\" This addition specifies the nature of the impurities, making the image of \"melted Gold\" more vivid by using terms associated with metallurgy.","The source uses the imperative \"Imaginez-vous\" (Imagine). The translator renders this as \"Pray, Madam, fansie to your self\". The addition of \"Pray, Madam,\" personalizes the address to the Marquise, reinforcing the dialogic style.","The source text says \"quels Corps étrangers ce sont là\" (what strange/foreign bodies these are). The target text clarifies these \"strange Bodies\" by explicitly naming them as \"these Spots of the Sun.\" This addition ensures the reader understands the referent, enhancing clarity.","The source states \"aussi grand que la Terre\" (as big as the Earth). The target translation \"full as big as the Globe of the Earth\" includes the intensifier \"full.\" This addition emphasizes the size comparison, making it more emphatic for the reader.","The source says \"aussi grand que la Terre\" (as big as the Earth). The translator has rendered this as \"full as big as the Globe of the Earth.\" The addition of \"the Globe of\" specifies the Earth as a spherical body and adds a degree of formality or grandeur to the comparison.","The source says the vision is \"causée par quelque chose qui arrive dans les Lunettes\" (caused by something that happens in the eyeglasses/telescopes). The target specifies this as \"the Effects of the Glasses of the Telescopes.\" The addition \"of the Telescopes\" after \"Glasses\" reiterates and clarifies that these are optical instruments, ensuring the reader understands the source of the potential optical illusion.","The source uses the impersonal pronoun \"On\" (One) saying \"On seroit au centre de tout\" (One would be at the center of everything). The translator specifies \"On\" as \"its Inhabitants\" (referring to hypothetical inhabitants of the Sun). This explicitation makes the subject clearer.","The source text states \"au centre de tout\" (at the center of everything). The translator has rendered \"tout\" as \"the Universe,\" making the scope of \"everything\" more specific and grander, aligning with the cosmological context.","The source has the Marquise say \"Vous n'y songez pas\" (You are not thinking about that). The translator adds \"whilst you speak,\" which specifies the timing of this lack of thought, making the critique more immediate.","The source uses \"Qui seroit dans le Soleil\" (Whoever/He who might be in the Sun). The translator specifies this hypothetical being as \"any living Creature.\" This addition clarifies the nature of the entity being discussed, making it explicit that it refers to a life form.","The source states \"verroit rien, ny Planetes, ny Etoiles Fixes\" (would see nothing, neither Planets, nor Fixed Stars). The target rephrases this as \"he wou'd see neither Planets, nor fixed Stars; nor, indeed, any thing\". The phrase \"nor, indeed, any thing\" is an emphatic reiteration of \"verroit rien\" (would see nothing), added for rhetorical effect.","The source text poses a rhetorical question: \"Le Soleil n'efface-t-il pas tout?\" (Does the Sun not blot out everything?). The translator replaces this question with an affirmative declarative sentence: \"the brightness of the Sun wou'd render all things else invisible;\". This added sentence explicitly states the reason why nothing else would be seen, providing a direct explanation.","The source says the inhabitants would believe themselves \"seuls dans toute la Nature\" (alone in all Nature).

But, pray, Madam, allow me to tell you, that you who have corrected me so justly, may also be mistaken your self: The Inhabitants of the Sun wou'd not so much as see it self; for they wou'd be incapable to support the dazling of his Light, or unable to receive it, by being too near; and all things well consider'd, the Sun wou'd be a Country of blind Men only. So that, once for all, I conclude, the Sun cannot be inhabited; and if you please, Madam, we will continue our Journey to the other Worlds: We are now come to the Centre, which is the lowest Point in all Circular Figures; and therefore must return back again, and go upwards. In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited.</p> <p>P049: The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and his Inhabitants see the Sun neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or Guards: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain</span></span>, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">vast Ocean,</span></span> and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and the Sphere</span></span> of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">from East to West,</span></span> round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">the Sphere of its Activity</span></span> can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">in a Vessel</span></span>, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">like an Onion</span></span>; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"43\">the Sun</span></span>, without the Effects of its Light.

but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"44\">notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet</span></span> every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"46\">which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives</span></span>, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"48\">and this is call'd</span></span> the particular <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"49\">Whirling, or</span></span> Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"50\">Sphere of its Activity can reach</span></span>;

but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"53\">with their Whirlings,</span></span> to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"54\">after the Creation of the Universe,</span></span> the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"56\">Sphere of Activity,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"57\">and forc'd its Obedience.</span></span> Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"58\">had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"59\">you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also,</span></span> Iupiter being ninety times bigger <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"60\">than <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"69\">our Earth</span></span></span></span>; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"61\">turning round her</span></span>: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"62\">Pray,</span></span> what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"63\">that our Earth</span></span> shall always remain in the same Situation?

The source 'reglent fort bien les rangs' (regulate the ranks very well) is made more specific by detailing the manner of regulation, implying a hierarchical or graduated system not explicit in the source.","The source 'parmi nous' (among us) is general. The translator specifies 'us Mortals' by adding 'Mortals', a common literary qualifier that emphasizes the human condition and potentially adds a slightly more formal or philosophical tone for the English audience.","The source phrase 'Me voilà fort en repos du côté de Jupiter' translates to 'Here I am, very much at ease/reassured concerning Jupiter.' The target text's 'no longer in fear' introduces the specific concept of prior 'fear' and its cessation, which is not explicitly stated in the source's 'fort en repos' (very much at ease/peace/rest).

The translator adds 'at ease' to this clause ('that he will leave us at ease in our own little Whirling'), explicitly stating the condition or manner in which they are left. This reinforces the Marquise's contentment, implied by 'Je suis bien aise' (I am very glad), but adds it directly into the description of Jupiter's action.","The source uses the French term 'tourbillon' within the phrase 'notre petit tourbillon' (our little whirlwind). The translator provides an English equivalent 'Whirling' and then adds 'or Tourbillion.' This addition of the original French term (albeit slightly anglicized in spelling) serves to clarify the concept for an English audience, who might be unfamiliar with 'tourbillon' as a specific scientific term from Cartesian physics, or it helps preserve Fontenelle's specific terminology.","The source says '& je ne lui envie point les quatre qu'il a' (...and I do not envy him the four that he has). The context implies Jupiter's moons. The target text translates this as 'and do not envy Iupiter his four Moons', explicitly adding 'Moons' to clarify what 'the four' refers to.

The source text 'à en éclairer une autre' means 'to enlighten another [planet]'. This addition provides clarity by focusing on the presumed beneficiaries of the light, consistent with the book's theme of populated worlds.","The translator added 'their long' to describe the nights on Jupiter.

The addition of 'long' is a descriptive elaboration not found in the source, perhaps to emphasize the duration and the consequential importance of the moons' illumination.","The translator added 'Madam;' as a term of address from the narrator to the Marquise. This is a conventional expression of politeness in English dialogue of the period and is not present in the French source.","The translator significantly expanded the Marquise's expressed wish. The source text implies that the inhabitants of Jupiter's moons would constantly perceive the 'monstrous Planet suspended over their heads'. The target text replaces this with a complex set of socio-political desires: for the moon inhabitants 'to be Colonies of Iupiter, and receive their Laws and Manners from thence, and pay Homage and Respect to Iupiter, and not to look upon that great Planet, but with Veneration.' These concepts are entirely new and not suggested by the source, possibly added to explore themes of governance or to make the dialogue more imaginative for the target audience.","This entire speech by the narrator ('said I') is an addition by the translator. It responds to and elaborates on the Marquise's (already translator-expanded) wish regarding interplanetary political structures. The narrator introduces further political concepts like ambassadors and fealty, and adds speculative astronomical details (Jupiter's apparent size, proximity of its moon) not present in this context in the source. The Marquise's original thought about Jupiter's imposing presence is then voiced by the narrator at the end of this added segment. This extensive addition serves to develop the theme of interplanetary relations and inject more imaginative, pseudo-scientific content.","The translator added 'Madam,' as a term of address from the narrator to the Marquise. Similar to a previous instance, this is a conventional expression of politeness in English dialogue of the period, not present in the French source.","The translator added 'in the Morning' to the description of Tycho Brahe's superstition. The source text 'Si en sortant de son logis' means 'If on leaving his lodging/home'.

The source \"n'a pû se delivrer impunément\" means \"could not free himself with impunity/without negative consequence.\" The target's \"was not free...for nothing\" suggests his lack of freedom or suffering was not without reason or purpose, adding an interpretive layer not explicitly present in the source's use of \"impunément.\"","The translator adds \"of Nature\" to \"the common Law\" (which translates \"la Loy commune\"), thereby specifying the type of law being discussed. This addition provides greater contextual and philosophical precision appropriate for the work's themes.","The translator elaborates on \"la pouvoir deviner\" (to be able to guess it) by adding the phrase \"at this time, what that may be.\" This addition provides more explicit contextual details regarding the timing and the specific object of the Marquise's intended guess, enhancing clarity.","The phrase \"my Fancy has just now suggested\" is an addition that replaces the source's more passive description \"qui m'occupe depuis quelques moments\" (which has been occupying me for some moments). This introduces the personified agent \"my Fancy\" and the specific action \"suggested,\" adding a literary embellishment and an explicit source for the thought.","The translator adds \"the Inhabitants of\" before \"Iupiter\" in the clause \"does the Inhabitants of Iupiter see our Earth?\" This clarifies that the question pertains to beings on Jupiter rather than the planet itself, resolving a potential ambiguity in the source \"Jupiter nous voit-il?\" (Does Jupiter see us?).","The translator clarifies the pronoun \"il\" (he/it) in the source sentence \"Il faudroit qu'il vît la Terre...\" by rendering it as \"the Inhabitants of Iupiter must see the Earth...\". This addition ensures the reader understands that it is Jupiter's inhabitants who are the potential observers, consistent with earlier clarifications.","The translator adds \"by them\" to the clause \"which is too small to be perceiv'd by them\". The source \"il ne la voit point\" (he/it doesn't see it) is made more specific by indicating who is unable to perceive the Earth, reinforcing the focus on Jupiter's inhabitants.","The translator replaces the French title \"le Journal des Savants\" with \"Philosophical Transactions,\" its prominent contemporary British equivalent. This cultural substitution introduces a specific English title not present in the source, thereby making the reference more familiar and relevant for an English-speaking audience of the period.","The word \"themselves\" is added after \"the Philosophers\" for emphasis. This addition highlights the philosophers' personal investment or direct opposition to the new discovery, a nuance not explicitly stated in the source.","The translator makes the vague pronoun \"cela\" (that) in the source text more explicit by rendering it as \"that discovery.\" This addition clarifies for the reader precisely what is undermining the philosophers' existing opinions.","The English phrase \"that will trouble themselves with the thoughts of it\" is a significant elaboration of the French \"qui en veulent bien douter\" (who are willing to doubt it). The added text introduces the idea of active mental engagement and consideration, which is not directly conveyed by the simpler source expression.","After translating \"une vision\" (a vision) as \"Fancy,\" the translator adds the contrasting phrase \"but a real thing.\" This addition serves to strongly affirm the reality of the astronomical observation, making the distinction more emphatic and explicit than in the original French.","The translator adds \"or Revolution\" after \"Motion\" (which translates the French \"mouvement\"). This addition provides a synonym or a more specific astronomical term, potentially for greater clarity or to introduce a term more familiar in English scientific discourse of the time.","The translator inserts \"a Planet and\" before \"a World\" in the phrase \"our Earth is a Planet and a World\". This addition provides a more specific scientific classification for Earth (\"Planet\") that is absent in the source text's more general term \"un Monde\" (a World), thus enhancing the scientific detail for the target reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P074: Si ce n'êtoit, dit la Marquise, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">qu'il n'est point trop agreable de savoir</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">qu'on ne nous peut découvrir de dedans Jupiter</span></span> qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche, je me représenterois <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">avec plaisir</span></span> ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">comme les nôtres le sont vers luy</span></span>, &amp; cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">les Planetes s'entre-considèrent</span></span> &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">demandent l'une de l'autre</span></span></span></span>, Quel monde est-ce là?

This is not explicitly present in the philosopher's reply in the source at this point, making the dialogue conform more to English conversational norms of the period and clarifying the addressee.","The translator added 'in that Planet' to explicitly specify that the 'remarkable thing' pertains to Saturn, which is the current topic. This addition enhances clarity for the reader by directly linking the characteristic to the planet under discussion.","The translator added 'in that World' to the translation of 'des Pays' (lands/regions) as 'Climates'. This explicitation clarifies that these 'Climates' are features of Saturn, conceptualized as a distinct 'World,' reinforcing the book's theme of planetary habitability.","The translator added 'together' to emphasize the continuous and uninterrupted nature of the fifteen-year-long night. While 'entiers' (whole/entire) in the source implies completeness, 'together' adds a distinct nuance of unbroken succession.","The source phrase 'assez élevé' translates to 'sufficiently elevated' or 'high enough'. The translator rendered this as 'elevated sufficiently high enough'. The addition of 'high' specifies the nature of the elevation (altitude), making the description more vivid, though it contributes to a somewhat redundant phrasing.","The source states the light is reflected 'dans les lieux' (in/into the places). The translator added 'upon the Inhabitants of Saturn', shifting the focus from the inanimate 'places' to the beings who might reside there. This addition aligns with the book's central theme of exploring life on other worlds.","The translator added the clause 'who have the Misfortune to live in that Climate, that is, so long a time depriv'd of the influence of his Beams.' This elaborates on the condition of the hypothesized Saturnian inhabitants in places without direct sunlight. The source simply states that these places 'ne le voyent point' (do not see it [the Sun]). The addition provides context, evokes empathy ('Misfortune'), and explains the consequence of the long nights for the inhabitants."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P078: En verité, dit la Marquise, de l'air d'une personne qui rentroit en elle-même avec étonnement, tout cela est d'un grand ordre; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">il paroît bien que la Nature a eu en veüe les besoins de quelques Etres vivans</span></span>, &amp; que la distribution des Lunes n'a pas êté faite au hazard.

This elaborates on Nature's role, making Nature's action more explicit and active ('provided for') compared to the French 'a eu en veüe' (had in view/considered).","The translator added 'the Inhabitants of this Planet'. The French uses the relative pronoun 'qui' (who), implicitly referring to beings on Venus and Mercury. This addition makes the agent explicit and clarifies who esteems the night, though 'this Planet' is a singular specification for a plural antecedent context.","The translator added the dialogue tag 'said Madam the Marquiese'.

This elaborates on 'Phosphores naturels' (natural phosphors) by explaining the inherent quality that allows the rocks to be phosphorescent, thus clarifying their nature for the reader.","The translator added the conditional phrase 'and if it be so' at the beginning of the sentence. This addition creates a stronger logical link to the preceding speculation about phosphorescent rocks on Mars, enhancing discourse coherence.","The translator added 'or Representation'. This serves as a synonym or clarification for 'Scene' (which translates 'Spectacle'), offering the reader an alternative term and potentially broadening comprehension of the original 'Spectacle'.","The translator added 'or Expence' to the phrase 'without Art'. This addition specifies that the natural illuminations are not only artless but also cost-free, an aspect implied but not explicitly stated in the source's 'sans aucun art' (without any art).","The translator added the comparative phrase 'as well as by that of a Candle'.

The translator adds the adjective 'flying,' specifying the birds' action or state. This provides a slightly more vivid or particular image than the general term 'Birds' alone.","The French 'qu'il faut des Lunes' (that moons are needed) is rendered as 'that they are absolutely necessary.' The addition of 'absolutely' intensifies the perceived need for moons, making the Marquise's statement stronger than in the source.","The source 'c'est une marque qu'il faut des Lunes' (it's a sign that moons are needed) is general. The translator adds 'as well to Mars' to make the Marquise's desire for Mars to have moons more explicit in this specific sentence, focusing the 'need' onto Mars based on her preceding statements.","The French 'si vous vous mêliez de Philosophie plus que vous ne faites' (if you involved yourself in Philosophy more than you do) is elaborated by the translator to 'if you think it worth your pains to make any further Progress in Philosophy'. This adds the notions of effort ('worth your pains') and advancement ('further Progress'), making the philosopher's tone more formal or perhaps slightly patronizing.","The translator adds the polite phrase 'if you please' to the philosopher's suggestion 'Let us do so with Mars', softening the command and making his tone more courteous for the English audience.","The source 'Nous serions bien étonnez' (We would be very astonished) is a declarative statement. The translator reframes this by adding 'And tell me if it wou'd not be', turning it into a rhetorical question that invites agreement and adds a conversational tone.","The translator adds the intensifier 'strangely' to 'surprizing' (which translates 'étonnez' from 'bien étonnez'). This heightens the degree of astonishment being described.","The source 'dans Saturne' (in Saturn) is translated as 'in the World of Saturn'. The addition 'in the World of' explicitly clarifies that they are referring to Saturn as a planetary body or realm, aligning with the book's theme of exploring different worlds.","The French 'on ne peut pas se dispenser de les peupler' (one cannot dispense with populating them) implies they must be populated. The translator makes this implication explicit by adding the clause 'for they must have Inhabitants,' reinforcing the certainty for the reader.","The source states the moons 'eussent un mouvement égal' (had an equal motion). The translator adds 'and turning one way,' specifying the directionality of this equal motion, a detail not explicitly present in the French, likely to provide a clearer astronomical picture.","The translator adds 'I spoke of' after 'the five little Moons' to remind the reader that these moons have been previously mentioned by the narrator, enhancing conversational flow and referential clarity.","The translator adds 'or whirlings' as an explanatory gloss for 'Tourbillion,' a French term (referring to Descartes' vortex theory) that might not be immediately familiar to all English readers, thus providing context.","The French 'Quoy qu'il en soit' (Be that as it may / Whatever the case) is more general. The translator specifies this by rendering it as 'and yet whatever is the Cause,' linking the statement more directly to the preceding speculation about Saturn's ring and moons.","The translator adds the concessive phrase ''Tis true,' before the statement that the ring gives light ('Il leur donne la lumiere'). This sets up a contrast with the subsequent point about the feebleness of that light, a rhetorical flourish not present in the direct French.","The French poses a rhetorical exclamation: 'mais quelle lumiere...!' (but what light...!). The translator provides an explicit interpretation by adding 'Sure a very feeble one,' directly stating the quality of light rather than leaving it implied.","The source 'expirer de chaud' means 'to die/expire from heat.' The translator uses the more graphic and intense phrase 'and melt away with heat,' adding a vivid, almost hyperbolic image not literally present in the French, possibly for dramatic effect.","The French 'en me parlant de Mercure' (by speaking to me of Mercury) is rendered as 'with the descriptions you gave me of Mercury.' The addition of 'the descriptions you gave me' makes the nature of the philosopher's previous discourse more explicit and detailed.","The French uses the impersonal pronoun 'on' in 'on est bien sage dans Saturne' (one is very wise in Saturn). The translator specifies this by adding 'the Inhabitants of,' making it clearer who is being described as wise.","The French 'tout le monde êtoit fou dans Mercure' (everyone was mad in Mercury) is rendered more specifically as 'the Inhabitants of Mercury,' providing parallelism with the inhabitants of Saturn and clarifying 'everyone'.","The French 'fou' (mad) is intensified in the translation to 'down-right mad.' The addition of 'down-right' emphasizes the degree of madness attributed to Mercury's inhabitants.","Similar to previous instances, the French impersonal 'on' in 'Si on n'est pas bien sage dans Saturne' (If one is not very wise in Saturn) is made more concrete by translating it as 'If the People of Saturn,' clarifying the subject.","The source says 'qui prennent toûjours un jour' (who always take a day). The translator adds 'at least' after 'a whole days time,' implying that a day is the minimum duration, thus emphasizing the extreme slowness of Saturn's inhabitants more strongly.","The translator adds the epithet 'the grave' to 'Cato,' emphasizing his serious nature, which is then contrasted with how the Saturnians would perceive him. The source simply states 'Caton d'Utique'.","The source refers to 'Caton d'Utique' (Cato of Utica, Cato the Younger). The translator changes this specific historical reference by replacing 'd'Utique' with 'the Censor,' referring to Cato the Elder, and adding this identifier.","The source ends with Cato being found 'trop badin & trop folâtre' (too playful and too skittish/frolicsome). The translator adds the phrase 'for their Conversation,' specifying the context in which Cato would be deemed unsuitable by the Saturnians."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P082: Il me vient une pensée, dit-elle.

'Now' acts as a discourse marker, 'upon our Earth' specifies 'nous,' and 'we have a mixture of both' makes explicit the implied consequence of having diverse temperaments, enhancing clarity.","The translator adds 'very' as an intensifier for 'airy' (the chosen translation for 'vifs' - lively), for emphasis.","The translator adds 'as' to create a parallel comparative structure ('very airy ... as insipid') in English, which is not explicitly in the source's simpler 'les autres lents' (others slow). This addition aims for stylistic balance.","The translator replaces the general 'au milieu des autres Mondes' (in the middle of the other Worlds) with the more specific 'between these two Worlds,' clarifying the reference to Mercury and Saturn previously mentioned.","The translator elaborates on 'des extrémitez' (of the extremes) by adding 'so' to emphasize the degree of participation and 'of the Qualities of both' to specify what aspect of the extremes is partaken, providing more detail.","The translator adds 'of People' to clarify that 'toutes les especes' (all the kinds/species) refers to human-like inhabitants in this context, preventing potential ambiguity.","The translator adds 'really' as an intensifier for 'believe,' strengthening the hypothetical assertion made by the speaker.","'ramassez' (gathered/collected) is translated as 'collected,' and the translator adds 'and drawn together' as a doublet, likely for emphasis or to provide a more vivid image of the assembly.","The translator clarifies 'd'être icy' (to be here) by rendering it as 'to live in ours' (i.e., our world), making the location more specific and relatable for the reader.","The translator elaborates on the nature of the 'abregement' (abridgement/summary). While the source implies an abridgement *of* the other worlds, the target specifies it as an abridgement 'of all that can be seen in' them, providing a fuller explanation.","The word 'commodité' encompasses meanings of convenience and advantage. The translator uses 'advantage and' conveniency, with 'advantage and' being added to 'conveniency' (as a translation of 'commodité') to form a doublet, capturing the full semantic range or for emphasis.","The phrase 'De plus,' (Moreover/Furthermore) is expanded. While 'over and above' can translate 'De plus,' the addition of 'And we have the good luck' introduces a subjective notion of fortune not explicit in the original, adding a layer of interpretation.","The source 'nous sommes justement dans un endroit de la Terre' (we are precisely in a place on Earth) is elaborated to 'to be born in a Climate of this Earth.' 'to be born in' specifies the nature of their presence, and 'Climate' specifies the type of 'endroit' (place), fitting the context of temperature and making it more precise.","The translator adds 'very' as an intensifier before 'Tourbillion,' for emphasis.","The translator makes the meaning of 'où je suis placée' (where I am placed) more explicit and specific by rendering it as 'where I was born,' clarifying a potential ambiguity.","'un goût' (a taste) is expanded to 'such a Sense and Taste.' The translator adds 'Sense and' to 'Taste' (the translation of 'goût'), forming a doublet to convey a broader meaning or for rhetorical emphasis. 'such a' connects it grammatically.","The phrase 'qui les mette à profit' (that puts them to use/profit) is expanded. 'all' specifies 'les' (them), 'our' clarifies for whose benefit, and 'Advantage and' forms a doublet with 'Profit' (translation of 'profit'), adding emphasis and detail.","'plaisirs' (pleasures) is translated as 'Pleasure,' and the translator adds 'or Satisfaction' as a doublet for emphasis or to broaden the semantic scope of 'pleasures' for the English reader.","This qualifying clause, 'than this World afforded,' is entirely new, added by the translator to specify the source or limitation of the pleasures being discussed, a contextual detail not present in the original French.","This conditional clause, 'If Philosophy be the Pleasure, you propose,' is a new element introduced by the translator. It links the following statement to philosophy being the pleasure under discussion, a framing absent in the source's direct question about a promise.","This phrase, 'I have the Boldness to wish,' reframes the philosopher's speech act. The source has 'Vous me promettez donc' (So you promise me), which seeks a commitment. The target's expression changes this to an assertion of a wish, altering the illocutionary force and tone.","While 'think of me' translates 'souviendriez de moy' (remember me), the phrase 'be pleas'd to' is an added layer of politeness or deference, possibly to align with English conversational norms of the period.","The source 'mais faites que' (but ensure that/make it so that) is translated with the elaboration 'provided you take care,' which emphasizes the conditionality ('provided') and the manner of action ('take care'), making the implicit more explicit.","The translator adds 'prepared for you' to the statement 'J'ai des Etoiles fixes' (I have fixed Stars), implying an active preparation by the speaker for the Marquise, which enriches the interaction and the speaker's characterisation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: CINQUIEME SOIR.

Can they be inhabited as the Planets are, said she to me? or are they not inhabited? what shall we make of 'em? If you wou'd take the Pains, you cou'd not fail to guess, said I, Madam, the fixt Stars cannot be less distant from the Earth, than fifty Millions of Leagues; nay, some Astronomers make the distance yet greater; that between the Sun and the remotest Planet is nothing if compared to the distance between the Sun or Earth, and the fix'd Stars; we do not trouble our selves to number 'em, their Lustre as you see is both clear and bright. If the fix'd Stars, receive their Light from the Sun, it must certainly be very weak and faint before it comes to 'em, having passed through a hundred and fifty Millions of Miles of the Celestial Substance, I spoke of before: Then consider, the fix'd Stars are oblig'd, to reflect this borrow'd Light upon us at the same distance, which Is every fixt Star the Center of a Tourbillion; and it may be full as big as our Sun? Is it possible, that all this Immense space, wherein our Sun and Planets have their Revolution, is nothing but an inconsiderable part of the Universe? And that every fix'd Star must comprehend and govern an equal space with our Sun? This confounds, afflicts, and frightens me. And for my part, said I, it pleases and rejoices me; when I believ'd the Universe to be nothing, but this great Azure Vault of the Heavens, wherein the Stars were placed, as it were so many golden Nails or Studs, the Universe seem'd to me too little and strait; I fansied my self to be confin'd and oppress'd: But now when I am perswaded, that this Azure Vault has a greater depth and a vaster Extent, and that 'tis divided into a thousand and a thousand different Tourbillions or Whirlings, I imagine I am at more Liberty, and breath a freer Air; and the Universe appears to me to be infinitely more Magnificent.

This question, 'which Is every fixt Star the Center of a Tourbillion; and it may be full as big as our Sun?', introduces the concept of tourbillons and the comparison to 'our Sun' prematurely from the philosopher's side, altering the original dialogue flow where the Marquise first voices these connections.","The translator elaborated on 'cloüées' (nailed) by adding 'as it were so many golden Nails or Studs' to create a more vivid and culturally specific image for the English audience, enhancing the description of the old Ptolemaic view of the cosmos.","The translator added 'a glorious Work' to the phrase 'worthy of her,' thereby embellishing the description of Nature's creation and making the praise more explicit and emphatic than the source's 'qui est tout-à-fait digne d'elle.'","The translator replaced 'Monde' (World) with the more technical-sounding doublet 'Sphere or Activity' to provide a more precise or scientific-flavored term for the limit of a sun's light within its own system, likely for clarification or to enhance the scientific tone for the English reader.","The translator added 'or Whirlings' as an English gloss or explanation for the French term 'Tourbillons' (Vortices), which might have been unfamiliar to the English audience, thus ensuring clarity of this key concept.","The translator inserted a list of specific negative actions ('circumventing, betraying, flattering, and poorly lying') to vividly illustrate the human ambition and effort that the Marquise decries, adding moral weight and specificity not present in the source's more general 'si on se donne tant de peine'.","The translator expanded on the idea of 'l'on ne connoît pas les Tourbillons' (one does not know the Tourbillons) by adding 'to grasp a part of a World they neither know nor understand,' thus emphasizing the ignorance behind human ambition and explicitly linking it to a lack of understanding of the vast cosmos.","The translator replaced the pronoun 'luy' (him, referring to Alexander) with the more descriptive and honorific 'to that great Prince,' clarifying Alexander's status and making the reference more explicit and formal for the reader.","The translator significantly expanded 'Un peu de foiblesse pour ce qui est beau' (A little weakness for what is beautiful) into 'a kind of Weakness in Love, a kind of frailty for what is delicate and handsom.' This addition specifies the nature of the weakness as romantic ('in Love') and elaborates on 'what is beautiful' with concrete English aesthetics ('delicate and handsom'), adding a more gallant and specific flavor.","The translator added 'or make the Charms of Wit ever the less' to the philosopher's list of enduring values. The source text focuses on physical beauty ('beaux yeux, ou une belle bouche'), while the addition introduces intellectual or personal charm ('Charms of Wit') as equally resilient to the universe's immensity, broadening the scope of what remains valuable."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P090: C'est une étrange chose que l'Amour, répondit-elle, en riant; il se sauve de tout, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">il n'y a point de Systême qui luy puisse faire de mal.</span></span> Mais aussi parlez- moi franchement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">votre Systême est-il bien vray?</span></span> Ne me déguisez rien, je vous garderay le secret.

The source 'de deviner' (to guess/to divine) is more general. This addition clarifies the object of the 'difficulty,' explicitly referencing the differences between Tourbillons that the characters are discussing, thereby enhancing clarity for the reader.","The translator added the phrase 'In one Tourbillion' at the beginning of this clause, replacing the French deictic 'Icy' (Here). This addition provides explicit context, clarifying that the philosopher is describing a hypothetical scenario within one specific type of vortex system, rather than relying on a less specific spatial reference.","The translator added the word 'round' to the description of the sun carrying its planets. The source phrase '& emporte ses Planetes avec soy' (and carries its Planets with it) does not specify the manner of carrying. The addition of 'round' elaborates on the nature of the planets' motion, suggesting a circular or orbital movement, which is contextually appropriate for astronomy and provides more detail.","The translator used 'the Counterpoise' within the phrase 'according to the Changes of the Counterpoise which balances 'em.' The source phrase 'par le changement de l'équilibre qui les tient suspenduës' (by the change of the equilibrium which holds them suspended) uses the general term 'l'équilibre' (equilibrium/balance). 'The Counterpoise' is an elaboration, introducing a more specific mechanical concept to explain how the planets are held in balance, thus offering a more concrete image to the target audience.","The translator added the vocative 'Madam' to the question. The source 'que voudriez-vous?' (What would you want?/What more could you ask?) does not contain this direct term of address.

The word 'infinitely' is an addition that significantly intensifies the quantity, providing an elaboration or heightened emphasis not present in the original French.","The French 'qui ne se montrent point aux yeux' (which do not show themselves to the eyes) implies unassisted vision. The translator added 'alone' after 'with our Eyes' to explicitly state that these stars are invisible to the naked eye, thus clarifying the contrast with stars seen 'by the help of Telescopes'.","The source text uses the pronoun 'en' ('of them'), referring back to 'Etoiles Fixes' mentioned earlier. The translator explicitly added 'fixed Stars' to ensure clarity for the English reader, specifying what was being counted in the constellation.","The source text uses 'il s'en trouve autant que' (one finds as many as), indicating an equal quantity compared to what was previously seen in the whole sky. The translation 'there have been discover'd more than' changes this to indicate a greater quantity.

'Superficies' translates 'faces plates' (flat faces) from the source; 'or flat Sides' provides a more common synonym or clarification for English readers.","Similar to the previous instance, 'or flat Sides' is added to explain 'Superficies,' which translates 'faces plates' from the source. This repetition reinforces the terminology for the reader.","The source 'faces en dehors' (external faces) is translated as 'flat Sides.' The addition of 'flat' makes explicit a geometric property (flatness) that, while implied by the overall context of facets, is not literally stated in the French 'faces en dehors.'","The translator uses the doublet 'Sides or Faces' for the French 'faces' (faces). This provides synonyms to ensure the English reader grasps the meaning of 'faces' in this geometrical context, possibly offering a more common term ('Sides') alongside a more direct translation ('Faces').","The French 'qui ménage bien le terrain' (who manages space well / makes good use of the ground) is significantly elaborated by the translator into 'who will lose nothing, and turns all her work to the best advantage.' This expansion clarifies and emphasizes the concept of Nature's efficiency for the English reader.","The translator adds 'flat' to 'Sides' (which translates 'faces' from the source). The source text says 'faces' (faces/sides). By adding 'flat,' the translator consistently reinforces the geometric nature of these surfaces, aligning with previous descriptions, even though 'flat' is not explicit in this specific French phrase.","The French 'fort contents d'eux-mêmes' (very content with themselves) is rendered as 'very well contented with their own Condition.' The phrase 'with their own Condition' elaborates on 'd'eux-mêmes,' specifying the aspect of their contentment for greater clarity.","The source 's'ajustent les uns avec les autres le mieux qu'il est possible' (adjust to each other as best as possible) is translated as 'are so rightly adjusted,' and then expanded with 'and join'd to one another in so delicate a Form.' This latter phrase adds a qualitative description of their interconnection ('delicate Form') not explicit in the French, which focuses on the adjustment process.","The source states tourbillions 'aident mutuellement leurs mouvements' (mutually help their movements) after comparing them to intermeshing watch wheels. The translator adds 'and yet moving contrary to one another,' which describes a common behavior of interlocked gears not explicitly mentioned in the source, thus providing a more specific mechanical detail.","The source uses the analogy 'comme un Ballon' (like a Balloon). The translator adds 'or Foot-ball,' providing a more concrete or culturally familiar example of an inflatable object for an English-speaking audience of that era.","The French 'il rentre en luy-même' (it returns into itself / shrinks back) is translated as 'it shrinks to its first form.' The addition 'to its first form' elaborates on the result of the shrinking, making the cyclical nature of the process clearer.","The source phrase '& ainsi de suite' (and so on) implies continuation of a cycle. The translator replaces this with the more explicit 'and is again depress'd,' detailing the next action in the cycle (being pushed by neighboring worlds), making the mechanism more concrete than the general French phrase.","The French 'on pretendent' (one/they claim or it is claimed) is rendered as 'the Philosophers pretend.' The translator specifies the indefinite pronoun 'on' as 'the Philosophers,' attributing the claim to a specific group, which adds a layer of context or perceived authority."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">toutes ces Idées-là</span></span>, dit la Marquise.

This addition enhances clarity by making the source of the ideas explicit.","The translator added the conjunction 'But,' at the beginning of this part of the sentence.

This enhances politeness and dialogue clarity, a common feature in English texts of the period, whereas the French text implies the addressee from the context of the conversations.","The French source 'ce n'est pas le seul.' translates to 'it is not the only one.' The pronoun 'le seul' (the only one) has an implied antecedent. The translator added the noun 'Traffick' to explicitly state this antecedent, providing clarity for the English reader regarding the nature of the interaction or subject being discussed.","The French verb 'visiter,' (to visit,) is general. In the phrase 'send Envoys sometimes to us,', the translator added the noun 'Envoys' to elaborate on the nature of these visits. This specification suggests more formal or diplomatic missions, complementing the description 'assez magnifiquement' (translated as 'with a great deal of Splendor').","The French phrase 'd'une queüe majestueuse.' means '(with) a majestic tail.' The target text translates this as 'a Royal Train.' While 'Train' is a translation for 'queüe' (tail, especially of a comet), the adjective 'Royal' is an addition. It specifies or intensifies the meaning of 'majestueuse' (majestic), lending a particular monarchical or heightened sense of grandeur to the comet's appearance."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P100: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Ah! quels Deputez dit-elle en riant!</span></span> On se passeroit bien de leur visite, elle ne sert qu'à faire peur. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Ils ne font peur qu'aux enfants</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">repliquay-je</span></span>, à cause de leur équipage extraordinaire, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">mais les enfants sont en grand nombre.</span></span> Les Cometes ne sont que des Planetes qui appartiennent à un Tourbillon voisin. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">Elles avoient leur mouvement vers ses extremitez,</span></span> mais ce Tourbillon êtant peut-être differemment pressé par ceux qui l'environnent, est plus rond par en haut, &amp; plus plat par en-bas, &amp; c'est par en-bas qu'il nous regarde. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Ces Planetes qui auront commencé vers le haut à se mouvoir en Cercle</span></span>, ne prévoyoient pas qu'en bas le Tourbillon leur manqueroit, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">parce qu'il est là comme écrasé,</span></span></span></span> &amp; pour continuer leur mouvement circulaire, il faut nécessairement qu'elles entrent dans <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">un autre Tourbillon, que je suppose qui est le nôtre,</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">&amp; qu'elles en coupent les extremitez.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">Aussi sont-elles toûjours fort élevées à notre égard,</span></span> elles marchent beaucoup au dessus de Saturne.

The translator expanded this by adding 'Fools and,' thus broadening the category of easily frightened people and adding a layer of social commentary not explicitly in the original.","The translator inserted 'Madam' as a polite term of address from the philosopher to the Marquise. This was a conventional way to render dialogue in English at the time, normalizing the conversation for the target audience.","The source's 'mais les enfants sont en grand nombre' (but children are in great number) is transformed. The translator added 'of those Ignorants' to explicitly characterize the previously mentioned 'Fools and Children,' and 'I confess' to add a personal, slightly concessive tone from the speaker, elaborating significantly on the original's simpler statement.","The source uses 'extremitez' (extremities). The translator added 'or Out-side of it' after 'Extremity' to provide a synonymous clarification, ensuring the English reader clearly understands the intended spatial meaning (the edge or boundary of the vortex).","The source's 'écrasé' (crushed) is expanded to the doublet 'braz'd or squeez'd,' with 'braz'd or' being the added part if 'squeez'd' is taken as the primary translation of 'écrasé'. This offers a more vivid pair of descriptors for the English reader.","The source uses 'là' (there). The translator made this more specific by adding 'in that part,' providing greater locative precision for the English reader.","The source text refers to 'Ces Planetes' (These Planets). The translator added the clarifying clause 'which we call Comets,' explicitly reminding the reader that these planets are indeed the comets under discussion, ensuring comprehension.","The source phrase 'que je suppose qui est le nôtre' (which I suppose is ours) indicates the speaker's hypothesis. The translator changed this to 'which happens sometimes to be ours,' adding the specific notion of occasional occurrence ('happens sometimes') not present in the original's expression of supposition.","The source states the planets 'coupent les extremitez' (cut its extremities). The translator elaborated this action by saying they are 'making their passage through,' adding a descriptive phrase about the process of movement rather than just the action of cutting.","The source text uses 'elles' (they) in 'sont-elles'.

Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles Fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumière; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes</span></span>; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">car que faire sans Soleil?</span></span> Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? Je vous diray, si vous voulez, répondis je, ce que disent de fort habiles Gens, que les Etoiles Fixes qui ont disparu ne sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est-à-dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mêmes, tantôt ils nous présentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantôt la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion-là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoître, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mêmes? Vous êtes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur.</span></span> Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles Fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantôt plus grandes tantôt plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus légers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres</span></span>, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez.</span></span> Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoîtroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoître de longtemps. Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, &amp; adieu le Soleil.</span></span> Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa</span></span>, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde.</span></span> Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet.

D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde?

Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">false </span></span> Light. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">after a long Sea-Voyage </span></span>. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light? The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, and then farewell the Sun <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and all its Light </span></span>. 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect. The Ancients were foolish to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience </span></span>; but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener, but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is: Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever, yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? Eternity is not so easy a matter; and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish. Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them. If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other. Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie. 'Tis sufficient for me to have carried your Understanding as far as your sight can penetrate.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P074: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">I understand you, said she, and am pleas'd with your Chamber of State; for we do not permit 'em to come directly in the middle of our Tourbillion, but receive 'em as the Grand Seignior does his Foreign Ministers; he does 'em not the Honour to lodge 'em in Constantinople, but sends 'em to the Suburbs. Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds.</span></span> At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">usually but a scurvy</span></span> threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">or false Light</span></span>. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">its Inhabitants</span></span>; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air</span></span>: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">meaning Saturn</span></span>; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">after a long Sea-Voyage</span></span>. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">no doubt,</span></span> you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">for all the Inhabitants of its</span></span> Planets; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">for there is no living without a Sun</span></span>.

This added text introduces a cultural analogy involving the \"Grand Seignior\" and diplomatic practices concerning foreign ministers and ambassadors, and elaborates on the behavior of tourbillons. This was likely added to make the abstract concepts more relatable or vivid for the English audience of the time by using familiar geopolitical references and also includes a reply from the narrator that is not in the source.","The translator added 'usually but a scurvy' to 'threatning Look'. 'Usually' introduces a frequency not in the source, and 'scurvy' adds a pejorative and colloquial quality to the description, possibly to enhance the character's voice or make the imagery more vivid for the English audience.","The translator added 'or false Light' to specify or provide an alternative term for 'illumination,' likely to ensure the reader understands that the light is not inherent to the comet but an effect.","The translator added 'its Inhabitants' to specify who Saturn would frighten, making the object of the 'fright' explicit, which was implied in the source.","The translator replaced the idea of changing tourbillons being 'entertaining' ('Rien n'est si divertissant') with the notion that 'nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air,' adding a familiar English proverb or concept. The phrase 'you know' is also added to create a more conversational tone, adapting the reasoning to a common cultural understanding.","The source text says 'disent-ils peut-être en parlant de Saturne' (they say perhaps, speaking of Saturn). The target text changes this to the more direct and explanatory 'meaning Saturn,' removing the element of conjecture and presenting it as a factual clarification for the reader.","The translator added 'after a long Sea-Voyage' to provide context for why mariners would cry 'Land! Land!', making the analogy clearer and more relatable for readers.","The translator replaced 'j'espère du moins' (I hope at least) with the stronger 'no doubt,' changing the tone from hopeful expectation to a statement of greater certainty about the Marquise's commiseration.","The translator added 'for all the Inhabitants of its' to 'Planets,' making explicit that the mortality affects the inhabitants of the planets, not just the planets themselves. This clarifies the impact of a sun's extinction.","The source's rhetorical question 'car que faire sans Soleil?' (for what to do without a Sun?) is replaced by a more direct declarative statement 'for there is no living without a Sun.' This offers a concrete consequence rather than leaving it as an open question, potentially for greater impact or clarity.","The translator expanded 'cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur' (however I will make another effort in your favor) into the more explicit 'However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way.' This clarifies the purpose ('for your Satisfaction') and nature ('solve this Objection') of the 'effort,' making the philosopher's intention clearer.","The translator interpreted 'plus légers & plus agiles' (lighter and more agile) as 'of less Light and Activity.' This specification clarifies a potentially ambiguous term ('légers' could mean less massive or less luminous) by adding descriptive qualities not explicitly stated in the source.","The translator added 'and are lost' after 'entirely vanish' (disparoissent entièrement). This addition reinforces the idea of the stars' complete and final disappearance, adding emphasis.","The translator added the phrase 'I spoke of,' making the reference to 'Half-Suns' more explicit by linking it to the narrator's previous explanation, aiding reader recall and continuity.","The translator added 'and all its Light' to 'farewell the Sun.' This clarifies what is lost when the sun is gone, emphasizing the cessation of its primary function (providing light).","The translator changed 'la force du Soleil' (the Sun's force) to 'the Face of the Sun.' This introduces a personification or vivid image ('Face') not present in the original, potentially for stylistic effect.","The translator added 'a great deal of' to 'time,' intensifying the amount of time required to ruin a world. This adds emphasis to the narrator's reassurance.","The translator added 'nor Life long enough' to 'Leisure.' The source text only mentions 'le loisir' (leisure/time). This addition elaborates on why the Ancients couldn't verify their beliefs, adding another limiting factor (lifespan) not present in the original.","The translator added 'now, Madam,' to the beginning of the rose analogy, making the transition more direct and conversational by explicitly addressing the Marquise.","The translator inserted 'nay,' before 'he changes not,' adding emphasis and a touch of rhetorical flourish to the roses' assertion about the gardener's immutability.","After 'he changes not,' the translator added 'and certainly will never be other than what he is.' This further elaborates on the roses' flawed reasoning, emphasizing their conviction in the gardener's immutability beyond what the source explicitly states ('il ne change seulement pas' - he only doesn't change).","This entire block of text is an addition by the translator, replacing the original philosophical reflection found in the source text ('Devons-nous établir notre durée... signe d'immortalité.'). It elaborates on the theme of human lifespan versus cosmic timescales, introducing examples and reflections on eternity and decay that are not present in the source's version of this reflection.","The translator added 'I am not so unreasonable,' as an introductory phrase for the Marquise's statement. This adds a polite and rational framing to her acceptance of the worlds' impermanence, enhancing her character.","The translator expanded 'qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses' (who lasts so long with respect to the roses) to the more explicit and emphatic 'who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses,' clarifying the extent of the gardener's longevity.","The translator elaborated 'ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent & qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres' (they are but like the roses themselves who are born and die in a garden one after the other) to 'They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next', adding more poetic and specific imagery for the roses' short life.","The translator added the parallel structure 'and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so' to link the analogy of roses to the appearance of new stars. This creates a more explicit and rhetorically balanced comparison not present in the source's simpler 'car' (for/because).","The translator significantly expanded 'il faut que l'espce se repare' (the species must be repaired/repair itself). The additions 'and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd' and 'and no Species can totally perish' provide a more elaborate explanation of cosmic renewal, framing it as a repair of a 'defect' and ensuring species survival.","The translator added the adjective 'glorious' to 'Works of Nature,' enhancing the description and emphasizing the grandeur of nature's creations.","The translator added 'and Flowers' to the list 'Herbs, Plants.' This makes the list more comprehensive and possibly more evocative for the reader than the source's 'des herbes ou des plantes' (herbs or plants).","The translator expanded 'qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage' (that it doesn't cost her more) to 'since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other.' The phrase 'Pains and Expence' elaborates on the nature of the 'cost,' making the comparison more concrete.","The translator replaced the concise 'n'en parlons plus' (let's not talk about it anymore) with the more elaborate and polite 'and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse.' This adds a layer of courtesy ('if you please') and formality to the suggestion."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers!</span></span></span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Je suis savante!</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Oüy, répliquay-je, vous l'êtes assez raisonnablement</span></span>, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">vous l'êtes avec la commodité de pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit dés que l'envie vous en prendra.</span></span> Je vous demande seulement pour recompense de mes peines <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">de ne voir jamais le Soleil, ny le Ciel, ny les Etoiles, sans songer à moy.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P075: What, cry'd out the Marquiese, have I the Systemes of all the Universe in my Head, am I become so learned?

While 'elle' in the source refers to the Marquise, explicitly naming her with 'the Marquiese' in the target text provides greater clarity for the English reader within the flow of dialogue.","The translator used the plural 'Systemes' and the phrasing 'of all the Universe' where the source has 'tout le systeme de l'Univers!' ('the whole system of the Universe!'). The change from the singular 'systeme' (system) to the plural 'Systemes' is an elaboration that may emphasize the plurality of worlds discussed in the book, altering the scope from a single comprehensive cosmic system to multiple ones.","The translator added 'become so' in the translation of 'Je suis savante!' ('I am learned!'). This addition introduces a nuance of transformation or having achieved a state of learnedness, which is an elaboration not explicitly present in the original statement of current state.","The translator added the direct address 'Madam' after 'Yes'. The French source 'Oüy, répliquay-je' ('Yes, I replied') does not include this specific term of address at this point. This addition formalizes the dialogue in English and makes the address explicit.","The translator added 'all or' to the options for belief. The French 'pouvoir ne rien croire de tout ce que je vous ay dit' means 'to be able to believe nothing of all that I have told you.' The target phrase 'believe all or nothing' expands this, offering the Marquise the additional option of complete belief, which is a significant alteration of the original proposition.","The translator added 'Moon' to the list of celestial objects. The source text lists 'le Soleil, ny le Ciel, ny les Etoiles' ('the Sun, nor the Sky/Heaven, nor the Stars'). The target text's list 'the Heavens, Sun, Moon or Stars' includes 'Moon', an item not present in the original French enumeration.
