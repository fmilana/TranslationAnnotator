Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moyndre Etoile; elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\"><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche.</span></span> Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cet</span></span>te belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">avec toute sa beauté brune</span></span>. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné.</span></span> Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil;</span></span> les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver.</span></span> Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée. Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle? Helas, repliquay-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde.

Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, repliquay-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self. Well, says she, since your Folly is so delightful, pray let me have a share in it, I'l believe what you please of the Stars, provided I find pleasure in it. Ah! Madam, said I, 'tis not a pleasure like that which you find in a Comedy of Moliere; 'tis a pleasure, I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind. And pray, says she, do you think me incapable of pleasures that are only in the Reason; bring me acquainted with your Stars, and you shall presently see the contrary. No, said I, it shall never be laid to my charge, that in a Grove, at ten of clock at night, I entertain'd the most lovely person in the World with nothing but Philosophy, look out for such Philosophers elsewhere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day.</span></span> I find I am falling into a Description, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it.</span></span> The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set.

The English simplifies to 'the Air was delicate and fresh, which made amends for the heat of the day.' This removes the sense of enduring ('essuyée') and the rewarding aspect, thus muting the contrast between discomfort and relief.","'la chose m'y porte necessairement' translates as 'the thing (subject) compels/necessitates me.' The English renders this as 'the Subject leads me naturally to it,' which loses the sense of inevitability and necessity, and softens the compulsion implied in the original.","The French 'presque toûjours blondes' (almost always blondes) becomes 'ever represented fair' in English, dropping the qualifier 'almost,' which flattens the nuance that there are rare exceptions.","'donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas' means 'to give this advantage to brunettes, you who are not one.' The translation renders it as 'to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self.' The English shifts 'Brune' (dark-haired/brunette) to 'black,' conflating hair color and possibly complexion, which changes the social/cultural connotation and introduces ambiguity not present in the French.","'si elle ne touche'—'if it does not move (emotionally touch)'—is rendered as 'unless it charm.' 'Charm' in English has a lighter, more superficial connotation than 'toucher' in French, which implies a deeper, more heartfelt emotional impact.","The French 'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste & de passionné' ('it does not inspire that indefinable something which is sad and passionate') is translated as 'it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion.' 'Inspire' is more about an outside influence, while 'creates' shifts the agency internally. Also, the 'je ne sçay quoi' (I know not what) is lost, missing the subtlety and the French idiom's cultural flavor.","'On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil;' is translated as 'we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun,' dropping the sense of 'marchent' (walk/march), and the implied contrast of deliberate, serene movement compared to the more imposing Sun.","'la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; & enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver.' The translation simplifies to 'and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd.' The English omits elements: the idea of ‘fixing one’s gaze’ is replaced by 'entertain the Eye with less trouble,' and the nuance of being the only person in all Nature dreaming is less poetic and philosophical; it loses the unity with Nature suggested in the original.","The original is: 'Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit.' The translation splits and merges this; 'That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night.' The English elides 'que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure' (as I just saw you about to fall), shifting the hesitation and observational aspect, as well as softening the immediacy and intimacy of her observing him in reverie.","'C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, & qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.' The translation: ''Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self.' The phrase 'qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante' (which has placed itself in my mind in a smiling/mirthful manner) is rendered as 'has with delight taken possession', which alters the gentle, whimsical tone of the French. Furthermore, 'agrément' means charm or pleasantness, but the translation uses 'delight is not amiss even in Truth itself,' which makes it sound like pleasure is simply acceptable rather than necessary to truth.","'avec toute sa beauté brune'—'with all its brunette/dark beauty' becomes 'all the dark beauties of the most glorious night' in English, shifting from a singular possessive (the beauty of the night itself) to a plural, introducing an idea of multiple beauties not present in the French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne sçavois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle qui ne sçavoit rien en matiere de Phisique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit estre une Planete; &amp; les Planetes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des Mondes.</span></span> J'en revenois toûjours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en nostre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes; &amp; si d'un autre costé vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le sçavoir, ce qui reviendrait au mesme. Mais on veut sçavoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est-là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier.</span></span> Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera. Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiete d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien, qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers; car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Suposons qu'ils voyoient le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent, qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé.</span></span> L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; &amp; cent autres resveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique? Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties. Avoüez la verité. N'avez-vous point eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne meritoit? J'ay vû des gens qui l'en estimoyent moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoyent connu. Et moy, repliqua-t-elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sçay qu'il ressemble à une Montre. Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples. </p><p>P005: Je ne sçay pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en verité, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir. Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la teste un faux Merveilleux envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent.

When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World.</span></span> So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed.</span></span> From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed:</span></span> One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch.

This condenses the Copernican assertion about planets being like Earth and mutes the pluralistic implication about multiple worlds.","The French 'cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier' (this condition is not, it seems to me, too much to be envied) is softened in English to 'a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed,' omitting 'it seems to me,' which makes the original statement more tentative and personal. The translation shifts the tone to imply a firmer, more universal judgment.","The French specifically says 'le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent' (the flight of Phaeton that the winds carry away), but the English changes this to 'the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind,' introducing a mythological metaphor absent in the French. This poetic expansion adds a grandeur and mythic quality not present in the original's more observational phrasing, thus shifting connotation.","The English translation compresses 'assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la teste un faux Merveilleux envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent. Ils n'admirent la Nature que parce qu'ils la croyent une espece de Magie où l'on n'entend rien, & il est seur qu'une chose est deshonorée auprés d'eux, dés qu'elle peut estre conceüe' into a more informal and less pointed phrase: 'We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected.' In doing so, it omits the link between darkness/obscurity and respect, and changes 'dés qu'elle peut estre conceüe' (as soon as it can be conceived) to 'whatsoever is once comprehended.' This subtly shifts the emphasis from rational understanding (conception) to psychological comprehension, and omits the social aspect of dishonor."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus interessée que je ne l'ay, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander.</span></span> Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne, &amp; nous y menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraye vie pastorale que de parler des Planetes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaist, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries. L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis.</span></span> La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes.</span></span> Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait.</span></span> C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule.</span></span> Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoyent esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pieces. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû.</span></span> Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvemens qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux</span></span>. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">that the ancient System is not at all tenable.</span></span> But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">World</span></span>, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study.</span></span> Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better.</span></span> 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars.</span></span> The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions</span></span>; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous.</span></span> I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour</span></span>; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens</span></span>. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them.

The French is specific that the speaker will stick to Astronomy only, specifying why she avoids the other two: the English blurs this distinction, potentially altering the portrayal of the Marquise's personality and self-perception.","The French phrase 'fort peu devot' refers specifically to the King's lack of devotion (i.e., not very devout/religious), whereas the translation uses 'something irreligious', a stronger and vaguer descriptor. This more pointed negative attribute subtly increases the irreverence of the King, slightly altering the tone and social acceptability in the 17th-century context.","The original French 'celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus', meaning 'those of two or three superfluous Heavens', is rendered as 'those three superfluous Heavens'. The English translation quantifies exactly (three), potentially introducing a number that is not present or emphasized in the source, which could mislead readers about the actual philosophical/historical idea.","The nuanced original French 'Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait' contains 'épargne' (parsimony, economy), here directly contrasted and paired with a 'surprising magnificence that shines in all [nature] has done.' The translation renders 'épargne' as 'Providence' (a more theological and less economic term), and flattens 'qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait' into 'is illustrious in all her actions', which both shifts the register and blunts the economic/magnificent contrast. This introduces a more providential, possibly theological reading, and reduces the focus on the philosophical point about economy in nature.","In the French, the ridicule comes from giving nature 'un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit' (a small plan executed with ten times more cost than necessary). The English translation shifts this to 'carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs', omitting the necessary comparison and the nuance that it is human perception that attributes this wastefulness, which blurs the criticism Fontenelle is making about the philosophical error.","The original French uses 'saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome', which connotes being seized with an astronomer's noble fury/enthusiasm. The translation omits the adjective 'Astronomical', simply saying 'possess'd with a noble ... fury', and thus slightly dilutes the sense of passionate scientific drive that is connected with the historicization of Copernicus's act. There is also a less vivid sense of agency in 'throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt', compared to the more vivid and playful original description.","The French says Copernicus 'punishes' the Earth for her long repose by giving her all the motions that she had previously attributed to the planets and heavens. The English alters the nuance, with 'to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens': 'charges her as near as he can' is less pointed than 'le plus qu'il peut', and 'impose'd' introduces a slight moral shade not present in the original. This dampens the playful irony of Fontenelle's personification of the Earth."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient.</span></span> Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabatu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes.</span></span> Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie?

The English translation simplifies to 'that stays with us, when all the rest of the Planets have forsaken us,' which lessens the sense of abandonment and agency of the planets, subtly shifting the original's emotional nuance.","The French 'voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes' frames Earth as now being mingled 'in the crowd' of other planets, conveying a sense of equality and lack of distinction. The English translation 'see the Earth now in the common road of the other Planets' replaces 'crowd' with 'common road,' which conveys more an idea of a shared path rather than loss of special distinctiveness, slightly altering the intended humility and leveling.","The French ironic statement that Copernicus 'died' upon receiving his printed book and 'avoided all the contradictions he foresaw, and cleverly got out of the affair' is sharply humorous and hyperbolic. The English 'He had no mind to withstand all the Contradiction he knew it would meet with, and therefore wisely withdrew' omits the irony of dying as an escape, and replaces it with a more neutral and pragmatic explanation, softening the satirical tone of the original.","The metaphor in French, 'Voila nostre rivage' (That's our shore/bank), makes a stronger poetic parallel between the distant fixed stars and a literal shoreline.

The translation 'that's call'd Bantring' shifts the connotation from boredom or disengagement to playful teasing, which softens the dismissiveness of the original and changes the tone.","The French 'vous moralisez, dit- elle, quand il est question de Phisique' means 'you moralize, she said, when the subject is physics.' The translation 'when there's a Question in Natural Philosophy, you begin to moralize' not only removes the direct attribution of speech but also changes the register: 'physics' suggests the physical sciences specifically, while 'Natural Philosophy' was the term commonly used in England during the Enlightenment for all natural sciences, making the English slightly more formal and less conversational, subtly altering the social dynamic and tone.","The original French 'nous emporte tous ensemble d'un mouvement général, & se joüe de la petite boule' literally means 'carries us all together with a general movement, and plays with the little ball.' The translation 'carrys us altogether with one general movement, and sports her self with the lit-Ball' retains the idea of Nature playing with the Earth ('little ball'), but 'sports her self with the lit-Ball' misrenders 'petite boule', as 'lit-Ball' could be misread as related to 'light' or 'literature', and also slightly personifies Nature (as 'she' sporting with the Earth), which is less subtle than 'se joüe de', thus introducing a manipulative connotation.","In the French 'la Terre, qui est assez solide, est couverte depuis sa surface jusqu'à vinght lieües de hauteur tout au plus, d'une espece de duvet, qui est l'air, & toute la Coque de Ver à Soye tourne en mesme temps,' the metaphor is that the Earth is like the silkworm's cocoon entirely, covered with a layer of air, and all turns together. In the translation, 'This and all the other Cod of the Silkworm turns at the same time', the phrase 'all the other Cod' is unclear, possibly implying other cocoons or parts in a way that is not present in the French (which simply refers to 'the entire cocoon'), slightly confusing the metaphor and thus altering the reader's understanding."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P019: En retournant au Château je luy dis pour épuiser la matiere des Systêmes, qu'il y en avoit un troisiéme inventé par Ticho- Brahé qui, voulant absolument que la Terre fust immobile, la plaçoit au centre du Monde, &amp; faisoit tourner autour d'elle le Soleil, autour duquel tournoient toutes les autres Planetes, parce que depuis les nouvelles Découvertes, il n'y avoit pas moyen de faire tourner les Planetes autour de la Terre.

This slightly alters the tone and diminishes the irony and intellectual context.","The original 'nous ne nous apercevons pas qu'elle est lumineuse, faute de nous pouvoir mettre à quelque distance d'elle' emphasizes our inability to notice the Earth's luminosity because we are too close to it, while the translation subtly shifts it to 'cannot discern that she is luminous, because we cannot set our selves at distance enough from her' — the loss of the agency and self-awareness present in the reflexive structure softens the philosophical implication.","The translation of 'frapez de l'éclat' as 'dazl'd with the lustre' loses some of the original connotation of being struck or deeply impressed, changing the intensity and nuance of the metaphor.","The phrase 'nous sommes toûjours dans un mauvais point de veüe' becomes 'still ill placed to take our view', which weakens the notion of a fundamentally incorrect or flawed perspective that is more present in the original.","'Nous voulons juger de nous, nous en sommes trop près; nous voulons juger des autres, nous en sommes trop loin.' becomes 'in judging of our selves we are too near, and in judging of others too far off.' The English version omits the volitional nuance ('nous voulons'), making the reflection less about human intention and more about observational happenstance, thereby subtly shifting the philosophical point.","'Qui serait entre la Lune & la Terre, ce seroit la vraye place pour les bien voir.' is translated as 'The middle place between the Moon and the Earth is the best to take a right prospect of both;' which converts a counterfactual or hypothetical ('Qui serait', 'ce seroit la vraye place') into a definitive statement, thereby reducing the sense of philosophical speculation.","'Il faudroit estre simplement Spectateur du Monde, & non pas Habitant.' becomes 'and better it would be, to be simply a Spectator of the World than an Inhabitant.' The translation omits the modal 'Il faudroit' ('one ought to'), thus weakening the suggestion of an ideal state and replacing it with a lighter, less prescriptive mood.","'je ne me consoleray jamais...si vous ne m'assurez que...' is rendered 'I shall never be comforted...unless you assure me that...' but omits the nuance in 'la préoccupation trop favorable où nous sommes pour la Lune' which refers to a prejudiced or excessive partiality, rendering it less about an ingrained preconception and more about simple partiality, thereby altering the connotation.","'le reste de ce visage que nostre imagination luy compose sur le fondement des tâches qu'elle nous montre.' is translated as 'and all the rest of the Face, which those Spots we discern in her, frame in our Imagination;' The English does not convey the idea of composition 'on the basis of the spots she shows us,' making the process seem more arbitrary and less derived from observation, subtly altering the connection between imagination and perception.","The French sentence structure in 'Ce n'est pas que la Lune ne tourne sur elle-mesme...c'est à dire, en un mois; mais lors qu'elle fait une partie de ce tremblement, & de s'imaginer que nous avons dans le Ciel comme un mouvement de Pendule qui va & vient.' is more ambiguous and open-ended, while the translation expands the scientific explanation (mentioning the Libratory motion, etc.) and closes with a specific assertion about mutual perception. This is an interpretive elaboration, adding explanatory material not present in the original and subtly steering the reader's understanding of the science, thus shifting the discursive focus."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P026: Toutes ces Planetes, dit la Marquise, sont faites comme nous, qui rejettons toûjours sur les autres ce qui est en nous-mesmes.

In the translation, 'when 'tis full Moon with us, 'tis the inlighten'd half of the Moon turn'd towards the obscure part of the Earth, and 'tis then they see us not at all, and count it New Earth,' the word 'part' is substituted for 'whole' ('obscure part' instead of 'whole obscure half of the Earth'), which subtly minimizes the mutual aspect presented in the astronomy. This lessens the implied symmetry and totality of the respective viewpoints (whole hemisphere seeing whole hemisphere), important for the dialogue's speculative tone.","In the original, 'ces trois Corps ne sont pas tres exactement rangez en ligne droite' (these three bodies are not exactly arranged in a straight line), 'celuy qui devroit faire l'Eclipse, jette son ombre un peu à costé de celuy qui en devroit estre couvert' (the one that ought to make the eclipse casts its shadow a bit to the side of the one to be covered). The translation gives 'not always in a right line one to the other' and then 'casts its Shadow a little on one side of that which should be obscured by it.' The phrase 'right line one to the other' is an awkward and less precise rendering of 'exactly in a straight line,' potentially misinforming the reader and diminishing the clear mechanical basis that Fontenelle provided, thus subtly altering the clarity and didactic intent of the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P028: Je suis fort étonnée, dit la Marquise, qu'il y ait si peu de mystere aux Eclipses, &amp; que tout le monde n'en devine pas la cause.

The translation adds 'for fear of preserving the memory', which is implicit but not explicit in the French, thus making the cause more explicit and diminishing the ironic legal register.","'défendist qu'on parlast jamais de rien' (should forbid ever speaking of anything) is purposely extreme and has the tone of hyperbolic legal satire. The translation 'forbid ever speaking of any thing' omits the slightly more formal and legalistic tone present in 'défendist qu'on parlast jamais de rien', thereby losing some of the comedic exaggeration.","'monument de quelque sotise des hommes' (monument of some folly of men) expresses that every thing is a record of some particular human folly.

The English translation reduces the sense of parody and mutuality by condensing the sentences and by introducing 'or' between clauses, which makes them alternative rather than cumulative. This changes the tone and slightly lessens the comic burlesque effect and cultural mirroring present in the original.","The French 'pourquoy Messieurs de la Lune auroient l'esprit plus fort que nous' ('why should the gentlemen of the Moon have a stronger mind than we do?') is rendered as 'why the Gentlemen of the Moon should have more Wit than we', which replaces the nuance of 'stronger mind' (implying greater rationality or resistance to superstition) with 'more Wit', which is more closely associated with cleverness or intelligence, thus altering the connotation of the original philosophical inquiry.","The French 'il ne faut qu'un peu d'esprit & d'habileté dans les Gens de ce Pays-là, pour détruire tous ces honneurs dont nous nous flattons, j'avoüe que je crains toûjours que nous n'ayons quelque desavantage' is translated as 'very little Wit and Ability is sufficient in the people of that Country, to destroy all those Honours we flatter our selves withal; I must confess, I am still afraid we have somewhat the disadvantage.' The translation introduces 'very little Wit and Ability is sufficient', subtly implying a deficit in those people rather than focusing on the ease with which they could undermine the imagined honours. The cautious, slightly ironic tone in the French about our insecurity is also softened in English by the phrase 'we have somewhat the disadvantage', which is less self-critical and understated compared to the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P031: Ne craignez rien, répondis-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">il n'y a pas d'apparence que nous soyons la seule sotte espece de l'Univers.</span></span> L'ignorance est quelque chose de bien propre à estre generalement répanduë, &amp; quoy que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">je ne fasse que deviner celle des Gens de la Lune, je n'en doute non plus que des Nouvelles les plus seures qui nous viennent de là</span></span>.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P026: Fear not, said I, it doth not appear that we are the only foolish Species in the World.

'Thither' is vague, potentially making it unclear whether it refers to the Moon or something else, thus making the narrative less direct about the lunar voyage.","'l'Arioste' (Ariosto, the Italian poet) is mistranslated as 'Ariosio' in the English text, making an error in the author's name and diminishing the historical-cultural specificity of the source.","The French 'qu'ils fissent ensemble le Voyage de la Lune' (they should take together the Journey to the Moon) is translated as 'it was necessary they should both together take a journey to the Moon', which weakens the mutual and somewhat adventurous spirit of the original; the French implies a sense of poetic collaboration, while the English sounds more perfunctory.","The original says Astolphe 'fut fort surpris de voir la Lune beaucoup plus grande qu'elle ne luy avoit paru de dessus la Terre' (was greatly surprised to see the Moon much larger than it had appeared to him from Earth); the translation says 'admir'd to see the Moon much bigger than she had appear'd to him from the Earth', using 'admired' instead of 'was greatly surprised', which changes the tone from true surprise to simple admiration and reduces the sense of wonderment and astonishment.","In French 'des Nymphes qui chassoient dans ces Forests' (Nymphs who were hunting in these forests) emphasizes the activity ('qui chassoient'), while the English simply states 'Nymphs hunting in those Forrests,' which flattens the progressive action and lively imagery of the French phrase.","The French 'un Vallon où se trouvoit tout ce qui se perdoit sur la Terre, de quelque espece qu'il fust' (a vale where everything lost on Earth, of whatever kind, could be found) becomes in English 'a great Vale, where was to be found all that was ever lost upon the Earth, of what kind soever': The translation omits the nuance in the original which highlights the ongoing process ('tout ce qui se perdoit'), thus subtly shifting from a dynamic to a static description."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sçais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune.

Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery.

However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse.

Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure.

C'est que les Papes ont prétendu...' is split in two in the English ('even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, the Popes...') which not only interrupts the original's rhetorical joke (the Donation itself is in the Moon), but also somewhat misses the humor of the supposed 'disappearance'—the translation instead creates ambiguity and makes it appear as if Ariosto whispers a literal explanation.","The original states that the liquid in the phials 's'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée' (evaporates easily if it is not enclosed/contained), but the English adds 'unless the Phiol be close stop'd', placing the emphasis on stopping up the bottle rather than simply being contained, introducing a subtly more practical and less fanciful tone.","The French passage has 'pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantost Philosophiques, tantost Poëtiques', making the correlation between telling visions (sometimes philosophical, sometimes poetic) and the filling of the phial. The English collapses this to 'since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical' and shifts the logic (merely entertaining, rather than the specific acts of vision-telling causing the growth), weakening the link between creativity and folly implied by the original.","The phrase 'mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientost aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune' is translated as 'that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long.' The double negative and tone in the French humorously suggest inevitability, whereas the English uses a convoluted construction ('not impossible but that'), lessening the original's playful irony and sense of certainty.","The phrase 'reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie' is translated as 'he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water.' The original is 'reprit tout son Esprit' (he recovered all his wits), while the English only mentions 'snuffed it up', omitting the explicit recovery of sense/wit, thereby diminishing the whimsical and comic effect of the analogy.","In the source, 'Il eut assez de peine à la porter, car l'Esprit de ce Heros estoit de sa nature assez pesant, & il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goute.' emphasizes the heaviness of the hero's 'spirit/wit' and not missing a single drop. The English removes the contrast ('not a drop wanting'), but doesn't fully capture the humor derived from the physical heaviness of wit/spirit compared to the spiritual or mental aspect.","The phrase 'il va errant sur vos yeux, sur vostre bouche, & si vous voulez bien que je m'en resaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly?' is rendered 'they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty?' The translation changes the immediacy and permission implied in 'permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres' and reduces 'Cela n'est-il pas joly?' (Isn't that pretty?) to 'Is not his pretty?', introducing a typographical error and losing the playful meta-commentary."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience?

The English says 'they'l not discover us; but I should be very glad we could know them', shifting from 'guessing/imagining' to 'discover/know', which changes the reciprocal, speculative emphasis to one of discovery or knowledge, making the intellectual context more empirical than originally intended.","The French 'vous voudriez sçavoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux' (you would like to know what happens in the Moon, in that other vessel which sails far from us through the heavens) is rendered as 'yet you would know what's done in the Moon, that other Vessel that sails in the Heavens at so great a distance from us'. The translation lessens the original's emphasis on curiosity and the unknowable events ('ce qui se passe'), changing it to a more static phrase ('what's done in the Moon'), losing the ongoing, dynamic sense of cosmic mystery and action."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoistra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connoistra jamais, cela est desesperant.

Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale.

En verité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous estes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre.</span></span> A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"10\">mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation.</span></span> De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde.

Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas?

If I should answer you seriously, said I, that we know not what may come to pass, you would laugh at me, and I should well deserve it, but in the mean time I could defend my self well enough if I pleas'd. I have a thought in my head that is very ridiculous, which yet (I know not how I got it, being so impertinent as it is) has some appearance of truth. I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it. Ah! says the Marchioness, you now give me some comfort; your fallacious reasoning made me sick.

The French 'je vais vous reduire à avoüer' implies 'I will reduce you (force you) to admit,' a subtle but more adversarial or witty tone than 'I'le hold a wager' which lightens the rhetorical tension.","The English 'Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus,' omits the directive 'Remettez-vous dans l'esprit' ('Recall to mind'), softening the original's rhetorical gesture and slightly reducing the conversational and intimate nature of the exchange.","The English 'and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals' misses the hypothetical/conditional implication in the French and slightly rewords the incredulity; this affects the sense of cultural astonishment present in the French, where 'n'avoient jamais conçeu' stresses the cognitive gap.","In the French, the sea is described as 'un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, & au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien' (a great forbidden space to men, which joined to the heavens, beyond which there was nothing). The English reduces 'défendu aux hommes' ('forbidden to men') to 'prohibited to men,' which slightly lessens the metaphysical awe and boundaries implied in the French.","The French 'à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient' ('they always swam, except for the moments they rested there') becomes, in the English, 'and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats.' The translation slightly alters the meaning, losing the nuance that their only respite from swimming was resting in the boat, instead suggesting that taking breath in the boat was their sole alternate activity.","The French 'qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus' ('that one could stop without moving in the middle of the agitated waves') becomes 'that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves,' where 'émus' (agitated/stirred) loses its vivid connotation and is made generic as 'rolling.'","The French metaphorically rich image of 'Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, & tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste' is condensed in the English: 'people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them.' The translation reduces the mythological resonance of the original by compressing the unique expressions ('écaillez de fer,' 'foudres') into more prosaic ones, thus dulling the fantastical and awe-laden tone.","The French sentence directly stresses the Americans' ignorance of Europe ('qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas'), but the English adds: 'and that they alone should not know it?' using 'alone' not implied in the source, which subtly shifts the sense toward the Americans being left out, rather than simply unaware.","The French 'nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller' ('we could very well imagine that one could go by air, if it were indeed possible') is simplified in English to 'would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there,' which reduces the emphasis on the capacity for imagination and the sense of hypothetical possibility.","The English 'Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings...' misses the playful deflection in the French opener, 'On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je...' ('In fact, more than imagining it possible, we are already beginning to fly a little'). The translation loses the understated self-correction and surprise present in the French.","The translation 'does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation' omits the definite article 'les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau,' and does not explicitly convey the sense of originality ('the very first ever put on water'). The translation thus subtly downplays the sense of pioneering innovation.","The division of the French sentence and its rhetorical emphasis about the mishaps in early attempts at flight is weakened by the English, which joins the consequences and the analogy without the same rhetorical impact or reflective tone present in the original sequence.","The English 'Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added?' replaces the French 'Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter?' where 'mis à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter' (brought to a point to which nothing could be added) is more open to future possibility than the closed phrasing of 'proceeded so far that nothing is to be added' in English.","The English 'So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon,' omits 'il ne fait encore que de naistre' (the art of flying 'is only just born'), reducing the sense of fresh, recent emergence in the French.","The translation 'I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck' loses the playfulness and implicit challenge of the French: 'Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou' ('I will never allow, she said, that people will ever fly, except in such a manner as to immediately break their necks'). The translation makes flying and injury mutually exclusive, while the French emphasizes the inevitability of disaster.","The English 'Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we,' omits the rhetorical twist: 'il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy' ('it doesn't matter whether we go there or they come here'), weakening Fontenelle's witty symmetry.","The English 'and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood' simplifies and rearranges: 'nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien,' downplaying the mutual incomprehension that the French highlights.","Replacing 'à bout de six mille ans... il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation' ('only after six thousand years... it took them that time to perfect Navigation'), the English 'after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean,' changes the emphasis of evolution and the duration's inevitability, losing the sense of it being a gradual and somewhat surprising culmination.","'the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be.' The English omits the present continuous sense that is contained in the French ('à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent'), making it seem less immediate and vivid.","'Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little;' simplifies the French 'Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu' ('Notice that the world is unfolding little by little'), not carrying over the explicit directive to 'remark/notice,' which sets a more active engagement from the audience in the original.","'The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon:' weakens the future potentiality and sense of gradual improvement--the French 'le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous, on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune.' ('the world may perhaps finish unfolding for us, we might get to know up to the Moon') which is more conditional and forward-looking.","'When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours' omits the anticipation and cosmic neighborliness in the French 'les Gens de la Lune.' The missing explicit reference to 'les Gens de la Lune' slightly shifts the focus away from the imagined lunar society as true neighbors.","In the English 'I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade,' the playful idea that a chimerical opinion can 'embarasser une personne d'esprit' (embarrass or trip up an intelligent person), while never actually persuading, is less sharp and pungent than the French's stress on intellectual embarrassment.","The English 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it.' subtly adds detail about 'insinuates' and 'seems only to remember it,' which are not as explicit in the French, thus providing interpretive paraphrase beyond the original's tone of effortless truth.","The phrase 'you now give me some comfort; your fallacious reasoning made me sick. I am now in a better condition to go to bed and sleep quietly, if you think fit that we retire.' changes the register of the closing French sentence, where the Marquise expresses relief at being free from the narrator's flawed logic, feeling now truly at ease to rest. The English uses 'now in a better condition,' which medicalizes the feeling instead of the original's domestic, conversational flavor."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P034: THE Third Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P034: THE Third Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P039: La Marquise voulut mégager pendant le jour à poursuivre nos Entretiens, mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">je luy representay que nous ne devions confier nos chimeres qu'à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles, puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet.</span></span> Nous ne manquasmes pas à aller le soir dans le Parc, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">qui devenoit un lieu consacré à nos Conuersations sçavantes.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P035: THe Marcioness would have ingag'd me to prosecute our Entertainments in the day time; but I told her, that we ought not to trust our Chimerical Notions to any but the Moon and Stars; for they were the Object of them, We fail'd not then in the Evening to take our Walk into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our learned Conversation.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P035: THe Marcioness would have ingag'd me to prosecute our Entertainments in the day time; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">but I told her, that we ought not to trust our Chimerical Notions to any but the Moon and Stars; for they were the Object of them,</span></span> We fail'd not then in the Evening to take our Walk into the Park, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"1\">which was now become a place consecrated to our learned Conversation.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The translation \"for they were the Object of them\" loses the causal and poetic nuance of the French phrase \"puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet.\" The original connects the act of confiding dreams to the Moon and Stars specifically because the conversations are about them, implying intimacy and appropriateness; the English makes this more mechanical and less charming, subtly changing the tone.","The translation \"which was now become a place consecrated to our learned Conversation\" shifts the meaning slightly. The French \"qui devenoit un lieu consacré à nos Conuersations sçavantes\" uses the imperfect tense, suggesting an ongoing process of the park becoming consecrated over time, while the English phrase suggests it has already happened, altering the temporal nuance and sense of gradual transformation present in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences estoit habitée, pourroit bien ne l'être point; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril.

Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost un Païs, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mesmes changemens sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voila le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'éleve point de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que nostre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement ou il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoy, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-estre que de grandes cavitez. De la distance ou nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, repliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la verité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantost une partie, tantost une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes. Mais ces mesmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mesmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour estre imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mesmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-mesme, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme nostre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de nostre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied-là, il faudra que la matiere étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voila ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance. Cela nous fournira des fruits, des bleds, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons. J'entends des fruits, des bleds, des eaux à la maniere de la Lune que je fais profession de ne pas connoistre, le tout proportionné aux besoins de ses Habitans que je ne connais pas non plus.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P036: I have News to tell you, said I. The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\">they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud</span></span>.

Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable.

The English version 'you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be.' translates 'donner que la moitié de son esprit' as 'yield your self but by halves', which shifts the emphasis from intellectual engagement (one's mind/spirit) to overall personal commitment, thus subtly manipulating the epistemic nuance from thoughtful caution to mere half-hearted belief.","The original contains a cultural reference to the Parisian suburb of Saint Denis and Paris proper ('la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint Denis ressemble à Paris'), suggesting an almost comical level of similarity/familiarity. The translation 'the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris.' omits the subtle local color of the comparison (which would have resonated with French readers familiar with the proximity and relationship between Paris and Saint Denis), thus flattening the original connotation and the friendly, urbane banter embedded in 17th-century French culture."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P041: C'est-à-dire, me dit la Marquise, que vous sçavez seulement que tout est bien, sans sçavoir comment il est; c'est beaucoup d'ignorance sur bien peu de science, mais il faut s'en consoler; je suis encore trop heureuse que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">vous ayez rendu à la Lune ses Habitans</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Je suis mesme fort contente que vous luy donniez un Air qui l'envelope en son particulier, il me sembleroit desormais que sans cela une Planete seroit trop nuë</span></span>.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P037: That is to say, says the Marchioness, that you only know all is well there, but know not how: 'tis indeed a great deal of ignorance with a little knowledge, but we must be content; I am but too happy that you have restor'd to the Moon her Inhabitants, I am likewise well pleas'd that you allow her Air to cover her; for otherwise I should think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P037: That is to say, says the Marchioness, that you only know all is well there, but know not how: 'tis indeed a great deal of ignorance with a little knowledge, but we must be content; I am but too happy that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"0\">you have restor'd to the Moon her Inhabitants</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">I am likewise well pleas'd that you allow her Air to cover her; for otherwise I should think a Planet too naked.</span></span></p>","explanations":["Though the phrase 'vous ayez rendu à la Lune ses Habitans' is literally 'that you have returned to the Moon her Inhabitants,' the translation 'restor'd to the Moon her Inhabitants' carries a connotation that the inhabitants were truly once lost and are now being officially brought back, whereas in the context of Fontenelle's playful speculation, it is more about entertaining the possibility rather than truly believing they are being 'restored.'","The phrase 'je suis encore trop heureuse' carries a tone of playful exaggeration or irony ('I am even too happy'), downplaying the seriousness—while 'I am but too happy' formalizes and literalizes the statement and loses the French subtlety of self-mockery or gentle irony.","The segment 'je suis mesme fort contente que vous luy donniez un Air qui l'envelope en son particulier, il me sembleroit desormais que sans cela une Planete seroit trop nuë' subtly plays with the notion of 'air' as both atmosphere and clothing, giving the planet a kind of modesty or propriety. The translation 'I am likewise well pleas'd that you allow her Air to cover her; for otherwise I should think a Planet too naked' flattens the connotations, making it seem more literal and stripping away some of the playful, personifying tone of the original.

The English changes this relational and time-specific nuance to a more general 'cannot dive to the bottom of our thick Air, to stay any long time', omitting the metaphor of 'dives of very little duration,' which loses Fontenelle's precise whimsical tone.","The French states 'beaucoup de barrières naturelles' (many natural barriers) while the English says 'three natural Barricades', reducing the indefinite plural of the French (implying multiple unspecified barriers) to a definite number (three), which is not justified by the original and changes the sense from an open-ended multiplicity to a closed list.","The French uses 'une espece de Lunette naturelle qui nous les change. Cette Lunette, c'est nostre Air' explicitly calling the air a 'natural telescope' (or spyglass/lens), emphasizing the mediator role of the air. The English softens this metaphor significantly by calling it 'a kind of natural Perspective' instead of 'lens' or 'spyglass', which weakens the scientific playfulness and the physical-optical image employed by Fontenelle.","This key statement—'il n'appartiendroit qu'à la matiere celeste de nous apporter la lumiere & les couleurs dans toute leur pureté, & telles qu'elles sont'—is omitted entirely in the English translation, erasing Fontenelle's notion that only the celestial matter itself could transmit light and color in their purest form. This changes the philosophical implications about the mediation and purity of perception and light.","The explanation of the 'lens' is much more elaborate and visually specific in the source, but the English translation compresses the conclusion by simply stating 'the Perspective through which all is seen, in respect of the people of the Moon is changed,' losing the full metaphor of a 'lens' changing for the people of the Moon.

The translation 'over and above our due' interprets this in a transactional or almost economic sense, subtly shifting the connotation from one of unearned, gratuitous grace ('grace que la Nature nous fait') to a more legalistic or deserved framework.","The translation renders the key clause as 'But it may not be so proper in •he???, where the Air is apparently more pure to beat down the Rays of the Sun before he rises or after he is set.' Aside from the evident typographical corruption, the mistranslation of 'renvoyer en bas les rayons' as 'to beat down the Rays' misses the nuance: the French means 'to send back downwards the rays,' i.e., to reflect them down to the surface, while 'beat down' suggests forceful blocking or scattering, subtly changing the sense of atmospheric physics under discussion.","'Il ne faudroit qu'oster celle-cy, le reste seroit une Ville à la maniere de la Lune.' literally means 'one would only need to remove this one (surface Rome), the rest would be a town in the manner of the Moon'. The translation, 'there needs no more than to take away this, the rest will be a Town like those in the Moon,' generalizes 'in the manner of the Moon' to 'like those in the Moon,' which subtly inserts the idea of multiple lunar towns and shifts the analogy from an abstract comparison of city forms to a more concrete (and unintended) image of multiple lunar settlements.","The original 'vous pourriez vous tromper plûtost que moy' renders as 'you might be mistaken sooner than I' or 'you could be more easily mistaken than I.' The English translation, 'you may be deceived sooner than I,' adds an external agent ('be deceived'), whereas the original is about making a mistake oneself, changing the implication from self-delusion or error to being tricked or misled."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P049: Il n'importe, dit la Marquise, je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle.

The English changes 'endroit si facheux' (such a wretched/unpleasant place) to 'that trouble', weakening the sense of misfortune or adversity experienced by souls.","The translator adds that the Moon and Earth send souls to each other 'as to their Paradise', which is not present in the French. This addition introduces a Christian notion of Paradise not explicit in the original, subtly shifting the connotation.","The original uses a metaphor 'de ramper avec beaucoup de peine' (to crawl with much difficulty), evoking a laborious, almost degrading human condition, while the translation uses 'take the pains to run', which downplays the sense of arduous ordeal and strips the original of its ironic, philosophical tone.","'Sur Vénus je reprens le Saint Denis' refers to resuming the astronomical longitude reckoning from the Parisian meridian, that is, the Saint Denis reference point. The translator renders it as 'and in Venus I return again to Saint Denis', which is ambiguous for English readers and doesn't clarify the original scientific context, omitting its technical significance.","The translation shifts 'qui n'ont que les mesmes mouvemens, jusque là tout est égal' (which have only the same motions; thus far all is equal) to 'have all the same motions; thus far all are equal', which can pass, but in context, omits the emphasis that the similarity goes only up to that point, potentially narrowing the philosophical contrast on natural order.","The phrase 'qu'il y auroit une exception justement en faveur de la Terre toute seule' means 'there would be an exception in favor of the Earth alone', while the translation gives 'the Earth only was exempted from it.' This removes the sense of special, almost arbitrary privilege implied in the original—'justement en faveur'—softening the argument about the illogical uniqueness of Earth's inhabited status.","Translation of 'Ciron' is uncertain ('Mite and the Cicon'); 'Ciron' refers to a tiny mite, but the English translation introduces both 'Mite and the Cicon', which is redundant and confusing, and could leave English readers unclear. The original makes a clear analogy: the ciron is the 'elephant' among invisible creatures, underscoring scale, which is blurred in the English rendering."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P050: Beaucoup de Corps qui paroissent solides, ne sont que des amas de ces Animaux imperceptibles, qui y trouvent pour leurs mouvemens autant de liberté qu'il leur en faut.

The phrase 'would indeed have good reason to believe themselves the only Creatures in Nature' imputes a stronger justification and less nuance than the French 'seraient bien fondez à se croire seuls', which is less assertive and open-ended, only suggesting that the inhabitants would be justified in believing they are alone without emphasizing exclusive 'Creature' status."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P063: J'avoüe que je m'estois trompé, répondis-je, je ne songeois qu'à la situation où est le Soleil,&amp; non à l'effet de sa lumiere; mais vous qui me redressez si à propos, vous voulez bien que je vous dise que vous vous estes trompée aussi; les Habitans du Soleil ne le verroient seulement pas.

The English translation splits this into 'that crowd of Stars, like Ants in their Hillock, that Grainery of Worlds', separating the metaphors, with 'Grainery of Worlds' implying a storage rather than the generative, multiplying connotation of 'graine de Mondes'. The indirect manipulation slightly shifts the poetic import and imagery intended by Fontenelle.","The source states 'on y peut dresser des Pigeons à porter des Lettres comme on fait icy dans le Levant', meaning 'one might train pigeons to carry letters, as is done here in the Levant'. The English 'Pigeons that are taught to carry Letters, may be as useful there as here in the Levant' is less precise: it introduces 'as useful there as here', which implies a utilitarian function rather than the novelty or analogy being made in the original, subtly shifting the tone from playful speculation to pragmatic comparison.","The closing French segment 'Ils nous regarderoient comme des Estres disgraciez de la Nature, & fremiroient de l'horreur de nostre condition' uses 'Estres disgraciez de la Nature', meaning 'beings out of favour/disgraced by Nature'. The English 'Beings curs'd by Nature' adds a distinctly more theological and negative connotation ('cursed'), which was not present in the secular and pitying tone of the original, subtly skewing the Enlightenment rationality of the French to a more superstitious English reading."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P096: Je ne vous demande pas, dit la Marquise, s'il y a des Lunes dans les Mondes de la Voye de Lait; je voy bien qu'elles n'y seroient de nul usage aux Planetes principales qui n'ont point de nuit, &amp; qui d'ailleurs marchent dans des espaces trop étroits pour s'embarrasser de cet attirail de Planetes subalternes.

This subtly amplifies the sense of exasperation and makes the tone less neutral.","The translation changes 'Boules' (balls or spheres) to 'Bowls', which refers to a different object altogether. The French clearly discusses the contact of round shapes (spheres, planets), in keeping with early modern physics (Descartes' vortices) and astronomical models; the English 'Bowls' shifts the imagery away from celestial spheres to a household object, which blurs the intended analogy and scientific context, thus altering the reader's perception of the question's seriousness and scope."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P097: Il y a beaucoup d'esprit, répondis-je, à avoir cette difficulté-là, &amp; mesme à ne la pouvoir résoudre; car elle est tres-bonne en soy, &amp; de la maniere dont vous la concevez, elle est sans réponse, &amp; c'est avoir bien peu d'esprit que de trouver des réponses à ce qui n'en a point.

The phrase about the Milky Way sustaining 'all these little worlds' is separated in the French, and the translation muddles the logical relationship (which is that the smallest facets support the small worlds, specifically those of the Milky Way). The translation's syntax risks suggesting the Milky Way sustains the void, which is not in the original.","The translation omits the hypothetical and somewhat playful tone present in the source: 'peut-estre par mille, qui n'incommodent point les autres, & ne laissent pas d'estre un ou deux, ou mille Mondes de plus' more directly says 'perhaps a thousand, who do not inconvenience the others, and nonetheless are one or two or a thousand more worlds.' The English renders it as 'which do not at all disturb the rest, and are only an addition of one or two or a thousand Worlds more'—changing the connotation from potentially playful or generous multiplicity to a more mechanical numerical addition, flattening the affect.","The phrase 'ils ne laissent pas d'estre fort contents d'eux-mesmes' is much stronger and more charming in French ('they are nonetheless very pleased with themselves'), while the English flattens this to 'they are yet well content in themselves,' which diminishes the intended whimsical personification of the 'little worlds.'","'Ce sont ceux sans doute dont on ne découvre les petits Soleils qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche, & qui sont en une quantité si prodigieuse' refers to 'those (worlds) whose little suns are discovered only with telescopes, and which are in a prodigious quantity.' The English says: 'whose Suns are not to be seen without the Telescope, and which are prodigious in number.' The English reverses the logic: the French is about discovery with telescopes (positive construction), while the English is about lack of visibility without telescopes (negative construction). This subtle shift manipulates the explanatory tone, making the worlds seem hidden and not to be seen, rather than discoverable.","The translation 'agree one with another the best they can: and whereas each of them must turn about his Sun...' misses the original's implication that adjustment (s’ajustent) is active and necessary for coexistence—not merely agreeing 'the best they can.' The tone shifts from clever adaptation to passive accord, undercutting the metaphor of mechanical ingenuity and necessity present in Fontenelle.","'They ingrain one within another like the Wheels of a Watch' simplifies 'Ils s'engrainent en quelque façon les uns dans les autres comme les rouës d'une Montre, & aident mutuellement leurs mouvemens.' The translation omits the explicit mutual assistance ('aident mutuellement leurs mouvemens'), losing the idea that the worlds help each other's movement, instead only noting 'ingrain one within another... and mutually help each other's motion,' which is less specific and less vivid in collaborative imagery.","The translation 'Every World... is like a Bladder that swells it self...' for 'Ballon qui s'enfle de soy-mesme...' omits the nuance that the world would extend itself if let alone and is immediately ('aussi-tost') repulsed by its neighbors. 'Repress'd' and 'contracts' in the translation is less dynamic than the opposition of forces described in the French; the original describes a lively opposition and repetition, while the English makes the process feel more mechanical and less energetic.","The translation for 'on pretend que les Etoiles Fixes ne nous envoyent cette lumiere tremblante, & ne paroissent briller à reprises, que parce que leurs Tourbillons poussent perpetuellement le nostre, & en sont perpetuellement repoussez.' says 'And 'tis thought that the fixed Stars give us a trembling Light, and seem to twinkle only, because their Vortices perpetually press upon ours, and are pressed by it.' The original has the idea of mutual pushing and repulsing being responsible for the twinkling, whereas the English simplification ('perpetually press upon ours, and are pressed by it') lessens the oscillating, ongoing quality central to the explanation in French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P098: J'aime fort toutes ces Idées-là, dit la Marquise.

The addition of 'strong' is not in the original and subtly shifts the scientific implication from an ambiguous or undefined sort to something forceful.","The French 'il ne sorte point de nostre Tourbillon' (that he does not leave our Vortex) is rendered as 'he should not stir at all out of our Vortex'. The addition of 'at all' and 'stir' instead of 'leave' softens the absolute sense in the French and introduces an informality not present in the original, altering the tone.","The French 'ayant mis bas cet accompagnement terrible, il revint se ranger icy avec les autres Planetes à ses fonctions ordinaires' refers to Saturn returning 'here with the other Planets to his ordinary functions' after having 'laid aside this terrible accompaniment.' The English is looser and omits 'here', smoothing over the original's notion of Saturn reintegrating specifically 'here' (in our Vortex), diluting the sense of location and order.","The French 'nous croyons nous autres estre bien malheureux quand il nous paroist une Comete; c'est la Comete elle-même qui est bien malheureuse' (we believe ourselves to be unhappy when a Comet appears to us; actually it is the Comet itself that is very unhappy) is weakened in the English by omitting 'very' (bien) and changing the cause/effect structure. The French underscores irony and misperception more sharply.","The French 'nous menons une vie assez ennuyeuse' translates to 'we lead a rather (quite) boring life', but the English renders this as 'lead a life uneasie enough.' 'Uneasy' conveys discomfort or fretfulness, while 'ennuyeuse' means boring or tedious. This shifts the connotation from ennui (boredom, central to Enlightenment themes) to discomfort, subtly manipulating the philosophical undertone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P104: Il ne faut donc plus songer, luy dis-je, à vous donner de la pitié pour les habitans d'une Comète, mais j'espere du moins que vous plaindrez ceux qui vivent dans un Tourbillon dont le Soleil vient à s'éteindre, &amp; qui demeurent dans une nuit éternelle.

Que ce soient ou des écumes, des broüillards, ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces taches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toujours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée belle, dit-on. Le Soleil a esté tres-pasle pendant des années entieres, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'estoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire, la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa; mais si elle eust continué, nous estions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je sçay les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pasle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même.

Je vous l'avouë, repris-je: Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changemens: soit lents, soit prompts, mais toujours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens estoient plaisans de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoyent pas encore vû changer. Avoyent-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'experience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se laissoient des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoyent suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela elles diroient, nous avons toûjours vû le mesme Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours esté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroistroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience.

How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</p> <p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</p> <p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature. Has not she the secret of causing Herbs and Plants to spring and dye in a continual Revolution? I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it.</p> <p>P111: In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that I have e'en left them.</p> <p>P112: Let us leave them more yet, said I, if you'l be persuaded by me, and talk no more of them; for you are now come to the highest Roof of Heaven, and to tell you whether there be Stars beyond that or not, will require more knowledge than I have. Place Worlds there, or place them not, 'twill depend upon your self.

'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"2\">Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time.</span></span> Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"3\">those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct.</span></span> How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone. </p><p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so. </p><p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"4\">Eternity is not so easily acquir'd.</span></span> A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality. </p><p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"5\">they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</span></span> </p><p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"6\">why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World?</span></span> I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"7\">Has not she the secret of causing Herbs and Plants to spring and dye in a continual Revolution?</span></span> I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it. </p><p>P111: In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"8\">I have e'en left them.</span></span> </p><p>P112: Let us leave them more yet, said I, if you'l be persuaded by me, and talk no more of them; for you are now come to the highest Roof of Heaven, and to tell you whether there be Stars beyond that or not, will require more knowledge than I have. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text IIM\" data-index=\"9\">Place Worlds there, or place them not, 'twill depend upon your self.

This subtly alters the Marquise's desire for consolation into a mere question of intensity.","The French makes it clear that 'des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoistroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoistre de longtemps' (Suns that would sink into the sky would disappear but once, and not reappear for a long time), but the English changes it to 'disappear but once for a long time' which blurs the distinction between temporary and permanent disappearance, failing to capture the idea that this kind of disappearance is unique rather than merely lengthy.","The French presents a gradual process: Suns obscure enough to cease being visible, then relight, then eventually are extinguished. The English skips some of the nuance and the sequential nature of 'en suite se rallument, & à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait', making the extinction seem more abrupt and less cyclical.","'On n'est pas si aisément éternel' (It's not so easy to be eternal) is rendered 'Eternity is not so easily acquir'd.' The translation introduces a more active and acquisitive sense ('acquir'd') versus the original's suggestion that eternity is simply not easily attained or ascribed. This subtly shifts the philosophical context from being to possessing.","The original stresses continuous replacement: 'il faut que l'espèce se repare' (the species must be repaired/replenished). The translation makes it seem merely an observation of succession and general 'reparation of the Species,' downplaying the underlying cycle of necessary renewal implied in the French.","The French presents a rhetorical question about the possibility and logic of matter recombining to form a new world. The translation, while accurate in substance, downplays the interrogative and speculative nuance ('pourquoy... ne pourra-t'elle pas') replacing it with 'why may not...?' which sounds less hypothetical and more justified.","The French asks if Nature has only the secret of making herbs and plants live and die in a continuous cycle, implying the use of that same secret for worlds. The English translation turns this into an assertion ('Has not she the secret') rather than a rhetorical limitation, changing the degree of speculation.","The Marquise's 'nous voila tout à fait revenuë' (I have quite come back/been brought back) expresses a more active process of re-evaluation or return from a previous position. The English 'I have e'en left them' instead implies abandonment or disengagement, thus reversing the sense.","The French highlights the arbitrary nature of putting or not putting worlds beyond the last vault of the heavens, emphasizing the voluntary and speculative power of philosophers ('c'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes... dépend de vous'). The English translation, while similar, shifts the agency from the philosophers to the reader ('which may be or not be, according as they please'), reducing the sense of the speculative domain and turning it into more of a fantastical option than a philosophical principle."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la teste tout le systeme de l'Univers!
