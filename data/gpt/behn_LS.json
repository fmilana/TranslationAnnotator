Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">La Lune étoit levée il y avoit peut- estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moindre Etoile, elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Ne trouvez-vous pas, lui dis-je, que le jour même n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t'elle, si elle ne touche.

C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-être aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hasard en mille figures différentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">J'ay toújours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Ah! m'écriai-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes.

Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une manière riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">Eh bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la moy, je croirai sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">Ah?

Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day? I confess, said she, the Day must yield to such a Night; the day which resembles a fair Beauty, which though more sparkling, is not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night. You are very generous, Madam, said I, to give the advantage to the brown, you who are so admirably fair your self: Yet without dispute, day is the most beautiful thing in Nature; and most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair. But, said she, Beauty is insipid, if it want the pleasure and power of charming; and you must acknowledge that the brightest day that ever you saw could never have engaged you in so agreeable an Ecstasie, as you were just now like to have faln into by the powerful attractions of this Night.</p> <p>P004: I agree to what you say, Madam, said I, but I must own at the same time, that a Beauty of your complexion would give me another sort of transport than the finest Night with all the advantages obscurity can give it.</p> <p>P005: Though that were true, said she, I should not be satisfied; since those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other. How comes it, that Lovers who are the best Judges of what is pleasing and touching, do always address themselves to the Night, in all their Songs and Elegies? I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that? The silence and gloom of the Night, said I, inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing. Besides, the Scene of the Universe by day-light appears too Uniform, we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts. Sir, replied Madam la Marqueise, I have always felt those effects of Night you tell me of, I love the Stars, and could be heartily angry with the Sun for taking them from my sight. Ah, cry'd I, I cannot forgive his taking from me the sight of all those Worlds that are there. Worlds, said she, what Worlds? And looking earnestly upon me, asked me again, what I meant? I ask your Pardon, Madam, said I, I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness. What weakness, said she, more earnestly than before? Alass, said I, I am sorry that I must confess I have imagined to my self, that every Star may perchance be another World, yet I would not swear that it is so; but I will believe it to be true, because that Opinion is so pleasant to me, and gives me very diverting Idea's, which have fixed themselves delightfully in my Imaginations, and 'tis necessary that even solid Truth should have it's agreeableness. Well, said she, since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it; I will believe whatever you please concerning the Stars, if I find it pleasant. Ah, Madam, said I, hastily, it is not such a Pleasure as you find in one of Mullier's Plays; it is a Pleasure that is-I know not where, in our Reason, and which only transports the Mind. What, replied she, do you think me then incapable of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind? I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars. Ah, Madam, cry'd I, I shall never indure to be reproach'd with that neglect of my own happiness, that in a Grove at ten a Clock of the Night, I talk'd of nothing but Philosophy, to the greatest Beauty in the World; no, Madam, search for Philosophy some where else.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description, which I cannot well avoid, the fineness of it leading me so necessarily to it.</span></span> </p><p>P003: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">The Moon was about an hour high, which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, and checker'd the Paths beneath with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation; but the Presence of a Person of her Wit and Beauty hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day?

the English summarizes this with the plainer 'might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation.'","The playful complexity and antithesis of the French ('la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde...') are made much more succinct, and comparisons are streamlined in English, omitting the nuances about 'plus brillant' and 'plus touchante.'","References to 'les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination' is expanded and rationalized ('modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind'), clarifying but also reducing the literary layer.","The French's 'Ce n'est rien que la beauté, si elle ne touche' is made concrete and accessible with 'Beauty is insipid, if it want the pleasure and power of charming,' and 'engaged you in so agreeable une resverie' is translated as 'engaged you in so agreeable an Ecstasie,' which is a more direct rendering.","'me feroit encore mieux resver' is simplified to 'would give me another sort of transport,' omitting the subtlety of dreaming and the contrast to 'la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune.'","The slightly tangled reasoning of the French is replaced by a simple assertion that fair Beauties do not have the soft effects (emotional impact) of darker Beauties, making the philosophical comparison more accessible.","The English omits the literary specificity of 'dans toutes les Chansons & toutes les Elegies que je connais' in favor of a more general statement.","The translator rewrites the explanation for why night receives lovers' confidences, drastically condensing and smoothing several lengthy French sentences full of speculation and imagery into a clearer and more direct discussion, sometimes straying slightly from the original's order and rhetorical complexity.","The French's somewhat formal repetition ('j'aime les Etoiles, & je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface') becomes blunt and conversational: 'I love the Stars, and could be heartily angry with the Sun for taking them from my sight.'","The 'tous ces Mondes' and the poetic double question with the Marquise's gaze are folded together into a single succinct English exchange.","In English, Fontenelle's playful self-accusation about 'mon imagination s'est échappée' becomes simply being 'led to this fond discovery of my weakness,' omitting the imagery of the mind escaping.","This passage is condensed and clarified in the English rendering, reducing repetition ('je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray') and providing a smoother, less tangled logic for the pleasure of belief and the necessity of agreeable truth.","The direct discourse and conditional complexity of the French are compressed, for readability, to 'since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it.'","The English simplifies both the syntax and imagery around Molière and the quality of pleasure, making Fontenelle's hesitation and the 'je ne sçay où dans la raison' more brisk.","A circuitous French phrase with 'je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles' is paraphrased briskly as 'I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars.'","The translation flattens the French's delicate humor ('il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir...') into a blunter English sentence, omitting the hedged style and wit of the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp;

Suposons qu'ils voyaient le Vol de Phaéton que les Vents enlèvent, qu'ils ne pouvoient découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne savoient point comment le derrière du Théâtre étoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrète qui enlève Phaéton. L'autre, Phaéton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaéton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Théâtre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaéton n'etoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler, que de laisser le haut du Théâtre vide; &amp; cent autres rêveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que lui descend.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra.</span></span> A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenue bien mécanique?

Some nuances about the hypothetical (si vous aviez/si vous étiez) are made more direct and conversational, and some reflective remarks are omitted or streamlined.","The English translation synthesizes multiple French sentences into one much more fluid—yet simplified—explanation. The generalized 'engineer in the pit' replaces 'quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre' and explanatory asides about audience perception and their indifference are expanded for clarity but at the expense of Fontenelle's playful asides and rhetorical flourishes.","The reference to 'cordes parfaitement bien cachées' and 'a deviner ce qui causoit les mouvements de l'Univers' is generalized and expanded to include lists ('Ropes, Pullies, Wheels and Weights') and a direct mention of 'the vast Frame of the Universe,' reducing the sentence's density and some ambiguity.","A lengthy and rhetorically structured French passage listing philosophers and mocking their varied explanations becomes a condensed English version that simplifies the list, merges narrative and dialogue, omits some rhetorical commentary (e.g., 'je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité') and streamlines the style to be more straightforward.","The English version splits up the sentence and uses more straightforward language, omitting some of the qualification and rhetorical questioning that Fontenelle layers in the original. The structure is transformed from extended hypotheticals and negations to much clearer statements.","The sentence is rendered as two English clauses joined by a semicolon, replacing the hypothetical 'on veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit' with a formulaic equivalency, and the detailed sequence of 'mouvements régléz qui dépendent de l'arrangement des parties' is reflected as a simpler 'ordered by Regular Motion, which depends upon the just and equal disposal of its Parts.'","The recursive rhetorical questioning from Fontenelle is condensed to a direct challenge, and multiple statements are collapsed for clarity, reducing stylistic repetition and some of the philosophical tone, while maintaining only the essential exchange.","The more elaborate French reflection on 'idées saines' and 'faux Merveilleux envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent' becomes a concise English reflection about 'just Idea's' and 'false Principle or other of Admiration, wraped up in obscurity,' omitting nuance and rhetorical escalation to improve accessibility.","Fontenelle's periphrastic sentence including 'vous êtes si bien disposée à entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire, que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, & à vous montrer le Monde' is rendered more simply as 'I find you so well disposed to comprehend all I have to say to you, that without further Preface, I need only draw the Curtain, and shew you the World,' condensing the motivation and eliminating some of the conversational tone."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P006: De la Terre où nous sommes, ce que nous voyons de plus éloigné, c'est ce Ciel bleu, cette grande voûte où les Etoiles sont attachées comme des cloux.

Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaît, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoient estre arrangées, &amp; c'est là ce que les Sçavants appellent faire un Sistême. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athénien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. Notre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature, sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne.

Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien.</span></span> Et pourquoi ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent- ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matière? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides.

Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous lui donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout à fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je.</span></span> Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoient esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pièces. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû.</span></span> Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin.</span></span> Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme,<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\"> &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvements qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux.</span></span> Enfin <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle.</span></span> Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</span></span> </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonnoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabattu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez- vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celui qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préséance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs. Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-être sans s'en apercevoir, ce principe qui le flate &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'intéresser à une affaire de pure speculation.</span></span> Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'aurait donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy- mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long- temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez- vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire. Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne autour, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir.<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\"> Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau.</span></span> Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avais laissées. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au delà de tous les Cercles des Planètes sont les Etoiles fixes, voilà nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois nécessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voie répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air savant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">N'ai-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoient, en voyant de certaines figures, Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voie icy.</span></span> </p><p>P009: Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voy que des pas d'Amans, c'est-à- dire, votre nom &amp; vos chiffres, gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs. Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le cercle que nous décrivons nous- mêmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur notre tête, comment se fait-il? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\">Avez-vous remarqué, lui répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? Elle va vers le but où elle est envoyée, &amp; en même temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-même, en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut. La Terre fait la même chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, elle tourne sur elle-même en vingt-quatre heures. Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le côté où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse.</span></span> Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planètes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur notre tête en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la même cause. Les Planètes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nôtre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planètes marchent aussi; cela nous met dans diférens points de veüe à leur égard, &amp; nous fait paroître dans leur cours des bizarreries dont il n'est pas nécessaire que je vous parle. Il suffit que vous sachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irrégulier dans les Planètes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont notre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fond elles sont toutes très-reglées.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtât moins à la Terre, on ne l'a guere ménagée, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité..</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"25\">Mais, lui répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de très grands Corps, fissent en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'il le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sut elle même en 24 heures.</span></span> </p><p>P010: Oh! répliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"26\">Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'expérience, que ce fût quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'un gros Navire monté de cent cinquante pièces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une très grande nombre de Marchandises? Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planètes. Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fût cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matière céleste, &amp; ne pas s'y laisser emporter? C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\">good quality</span></span> alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\">System</span></span>, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</p> <p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\">World</span></span>, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\">discover Irregularities in their Revolutions</span></span>, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy.

The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true.</span></span> I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice.</span></span> The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing.</span></span> But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others.</span></span> Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</span></span> </p><p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong;</span></span> the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way:</span></span> All things now turn round the Sun; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth.</span></span></span></span> Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth.</span></span> I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation.</span></span> Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat.</span></span> True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"21\">Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place.</span></span> 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass?<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"22\"> Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting.</span></span> This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"23\">Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"24\">I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"25\">But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis.</span></span> Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"26\">And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The original's complex structure describing humanity's self-centered folly and the philosopher's justification is rendered more simply: the English breaks up the sentence and omits the nuance of 'ils vous répondent froidement', translating it as a philosopher 'will tell you gravely'. The flow is smoother and vocabulary is more familiar.","The translation tightens and clarifies the idea: instead of the more abstract 'on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer', English directly has 'Man believed', making the intent clearer and more direct.","The original is one long sentence; the translation divides it and drops the French's emphasis—'ce fut donc...', simplifying the presentation of the list of planetary spheres.","The English passage is made simpler and more linear; it removes the layered clause 'plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre' and instead summarizes with 'the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth...', clarifying for easier comprehension.","Here the verbose and ornate French is compressed into 'I have very much softned and explained this System', losing the phrase 'que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême' and its subtlety, for a straightforward statement.","The English is more direct and condensed, breaking up a lengthy, intricate enumeration into clear, short phrases. Key details about the irregularities and their navigation are summarized.","Subtle qualifiers like 'apparemment fort peu devot' for the King are shrunk to '(not over devout)', and the anecdote is recast as a punchier, simpler statement.","The English condenses the detail: the reasoning about 'bons avis' for removing the circles is clarified and shortened, with 'no doubt...' and no repetition of 'regardoient'.","The list of motions is simplified—'ils faisoient, au-delà du dernier Ciel... un Ciel de cristal...' is summarized to 'did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven...', omitting the recursive imaginative process and making the meaning transparent.","The transformation from 'il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide' to 'there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance' removes some of the vivid imagery about breaking spheres, focusing on outcome.","The translation cuts into two sentences, combining the certainty of contemporary observation with the conclusion that the Ptolemaic system is 'not to be defended', omitting 'par cet endroit' and using more accessible phrasing.","The French's longer sentence about why the King cannot offer advice is compressed and clarified to 'will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising', smoothing over nuance and focusing on simplicity.","The assurance in French, 'Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles', simply becomes 'There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties', omitting the hedging and adjusting tone for clarity.","The French description—'Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome...'—is rendered as 'being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance...', which shortens the sense of drama and simplifies the visual language.","French's 'Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, & parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin.' is rendered as 'and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way:', which is more direct and less nuanced.","The complex motivation for Copernicus's 'punishment' of the Earth (for its rest) is simplified and more repetitive, losing the French's rhetorical play and density.","The phrase 'de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner & environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle.' becomes 'having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon...', compressing metaphor and style for a simpler conclusion.","The French's nested structure turns into a much more linear, step-by-step description: 'The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it...' in the English, making the explanation easier to visualize.","The English removes much of the emotional and rhetorical play about rank and ambition in the universe, collapsing it to a comparison of planetary and diplomatic precedence, and focuses on speculation, omitting shared inner motivation in more ornate French.","The interrupted and self-conscious French phrasing about earth's movement and the boat analogy is smoothed into a single, familiar analogy to the reader.","The French paragraph building up the visual experience and logic of the zodiac is collapsed and ordered, with side details omitted and a more logical structure favored for explaining the zodiac's nature.","Both anecdote and self-reflexive commentary in French are compressed: the mathematical steps on sand become a straight summary and the sense of feminine propriety is streamlined.","The French is more verbose and elaborate in its analogy of the rolling ball and earth; the English recasts this as a sports analogy with 'Bowl thrown on the Earth', standardizing and abbreviating the explanation.","The whole segment about planetary irregularities, intersection of perspective, and unnecessary detail is simply explained as 'Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy...I will not now trouble you with...' etc., dropping reference to 'bizarreries' and streamlining the justification.","The French internal dialogue, with both light complaint and humor about the earth's trouble, is replaced by 'I agree with all my heart...' etc., which omits the nuances of 'on ne l'a guere ménagée' and gives a brisker take.","The choice presented to the Marquise is simplified—'aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, & tous les autres Astres...' becomes 'wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars...shou'd make a vast Circumference...', which is shorter and clearer.","The extended ship metaphor, originally filled with size, weight, and particulars, is softened: 'a First-Rate Ship...of a hundred and twenty Guns...' and so on, is compared to the French's long string of details.

She sent me word, that now she was pretty well accustom'd to the Motion of the Earth, and that Copernicus himself cou'd not have rested better that Night than she did. A little after this, there came Company to visit my Lady, which, according to the nauseous Country-fashion, stay'd till the Evening, and yet we thought our selves happy that we were so easily rid of 'em then, since, according to the custom of the Country, they might have prolong'd their Visit till the next Day; but they were so civil, as not to do it; so that Madam the Marquiese and I found our selves at liberty. In the Evening we went again to the Park, and the Conversation began as it ended before, of our System: My Lady Marquiese had comprehended 'em so well, that she wou'd not be at the pains to re-assume any thing of what had pass'd, but press'd me to lead her to something that was new. Well, said I, since the Sun, which is now immoveable, and no longer a Planet; and that the Earth, that moves round the Sun, is now one, be not surpriz'd if I tell you, the Moon is another Earth, and is, by all appearance, inhabited. Said she, I never heard of the Moon's being inhabited, but as a Fable. So it may be still, said I; I concern my self no further in these Matters, than Men use to do in Civil Wars; where the Uncertainty of what may be, makes People still entertain a Correspondence with the adverse Party: As for me, tho' I see the Moon inhabited, I live very civilly with those that do not believe it; and I carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, upon occasion, with Honour go over to their side who have the better; but still they gain some considerable Advantage over us.

All these Arguments wou'd not prevail upon my Citizen; who wou'd continue still obstinate in maintaining, that St. Denis was not inhabited, because he saw none of the People. The Moon is our St. Denis, and we the Citizens of Paris, that never went out of our own Town. Ah, interrupted the Marquiese, you do us wrong; we are not so foolish as your Citizens of Paris: Since he sees that St. Denis is so like to Paris in every thing, he must have lost his Reason, if he did not think it was inhabited: But for the Moon, that's nothing like the Earth. Have a care, Madam, said I, what you say; for if I make it appear, that the Moon is in every thing like the Earth, you are oblig'd to believe that the Moon is inhabited.

The English translation simplifies by combining information, using more conversational phrasing, and omitting some stylistic flourishes (such as 'dormir en tournant' becoming 'had slept that Night in turning round', and streamlining the response by shortening the comparison to Copernicus).","The English text condenses the nuanced social commentary about rural visiting customs, e.g., 'Encore leur fut-on bien obligé...' is rendered as 'and yet we thought our selves happy that we were so easily rid of 'em then,' omitting some of the rationale and gentler politeness of the original, and instead using colloquial, more direct language (such as 'so civil, as not to do it').","The translation simplifies sentence structure and vocabulary: 'la conversation ne manqua pas de tourner aussitôt sur nos Sistêmes.

The formal literary style is lightened and condensed.","The translation removes idiomatic expressions and elaborate metaphor from the French, such as 'que comme d'une folie & d'une vision' becoming 'but as a Fable', and the detailed analogy about civil wars is rendered more briefly and directly ('I concern my self no further in these Matters, than Men use to do in Civil Wars... carry my self so trimmingly, that I may, upon occasion, with Honour go over to their side who have the better', omitting 'ménagemens avec ses Ennemis mêmes' and reducing the complexity).","The translator simplifies several constructions: the elaborate conditional logic and descriptive language in French are rendered in more straightforward English, tightening the narrative about the citizen of Paris and omitting discursive commentary like 'il s'obstinera toûjours à soûtenir'. The English instead uses 'continue still obstinate', making the passage more concise and accessible.","The phrase 'vous nous faites tort, nous ne sommes point si sots que votre Bourgeois' is simplified to 'you do us wrong; we are not so foolish as your Citizens of Paris', changing the tonality and condensing the structure. Further, the translation cuts 'il faut qu'il ait perdu la raison pour ne le pas croire habité' to 'he must have lost his Reason, if he did not think it was inhabited', making the logic more explicit while shortening the sentence and lightening the style.","The translation condenses and re-structures an intricate sentence from the French.

You are always for the Moon, said I, and you cannot rid your self of those Remains of Kindness you have for her. Light is compos'd for little Balls, which rebound upon any solid Body, which is opaque, or obscure, and are sent back another way; whereas they pass through any thing that offers them an Opening, or Passage, in a streight Line; which is Diaphanus, or clear; such as Air and Glass: So that the Moon enlightens us, because she is an Opaque, solid Body, which retorts these little Balls upon us; and I believe you will not dispute the same Solidity to the Earth. Admire then, Madam, how advantageous it is, to be well posted; so that the Moon being at a great distance from us, we see it as an enlightned Body only, but are ignorant that 'tis a gross, solid Mass, very much like the Earth: On the other hand, the Earth having the ill luck to be seen by us too near, we consider it only as a great massy Body, fit only for the producing of Food for living Creatures. 'Tis just, said the Marquiese, as when we are struck and surpriz'd with the Splendour of Quality above our own; we do not perceive, that in the main, there's no difference between them and us. 'Tis just so, said I; and we will needs be judging of every thing; but we have the mis-fortune, still to be plac'd in a false Light: Wou'd we judge of our selves, we are too near; if of others, we are too far off: Cou'd one be plac'd between the Moon and the Earth, that wou'd be a true Station to consider both well: To this End, we ought only to be Spectators of the World, and not Inhabitants. I shall never be satisfy'd, said the Marquiese, with the Injury we do the Earth, in being too favourably engag'd for the Inhabitants of the Moon, unless you can assure me, that they are as ignorant of their Advantages, as we are of ours; and that they take our Earth for a Star, without knowing that the Globe they inhabit is one also. Be assur'd of that, Madam, said I, that the Earth appears to them to perform all the Functions of a Star: 'Tis true, they do not see the Earth describe a Circle round 'em, but that's all one; I'll explain to you what it is: That side of the Moon which was turn'd towards the Earth at the beginning of the World, has continu'd towards the Earth ever since; which still represents to us these same Eyes, Nose and Mouth, which our Imaginations fansie we see compos'd of these Spots, Lights and Shadows, which are the Surface of the Moon: Cou'd we see the other half of the Moon, 'tis possible our Fancy wou'd represent to us some other Figure. This does not argue, but the Moon turns however upon her own Axis, and takes as much time to perform that Revolution, as she does to go round the Earth in a Month.

All depends upon the different Opposition and Aspects between the Moon and the Earth: The first and second Day of the Moon, we do not see her, because she is betwixt the Sun and us, and moves with the Sun by our Day; it necessarily follows, that the half of the Moon which is enlightned, is turn'd towards the Sun, and the obscure part towards the Earth; 'tis no wonder then, that we cannot see that half which is dark; but that same half of the Moon which is in Darkness, being turn'd towards the enlightned half of the Earth, the Inhabitants see us, without being seen, and the Earth appears to them, as their Full-Moon does to us; and so, if one may use the Expression, 'tis with them Full-Earth.

In America, the People were perswaded, that the Sun and Moon were angry with 'em when they were eclips'd; and God knows what pains they are at, to make their Peace with 'em. But the Grecians, who were so polite a People, Did not they believe for a long time, that the Moon was bewitch'd, and that the Magician made her come down, to throw a certain poisonous Scum or Dew upon the Herbs and Grass? And even we our selves, Were we not frightned out of our Wits at an Eclipse of the Sun, that happen'd about thirty Years since? Did not a great many People shut themselves up in Vaults and Cellars?

The cause and effect is made explicit and familiarized for the English reader, losing the more formal, indirect style of the French.","The phrase 'et Dieu sait ce qu'on ne faisoit pas pour se raccommoder avec eux' is rendered as 'God knows what pains they are at, to make their Peace with 'em', which recasts the somewhat ironic and open-ended French structure into a more straightforward, idiomatic English expression.","The French sentence pairs a description of Greek sophistication with the long-standing belief about magic and the moon in a single complex sentence; the translation divides it into two simpler sentences, making it clearer and less nuanced ('who were so polite a People, Did not they believe for a long time...'), and replacing 'ensorcelée' with the more familiar 'bewitch'd'.","The French sentence is broken up for readability: the recounting of the eclipse and the reactions ('Une infinité de Gens ne se tinrent-ils pas enfermez...') is split into three distinct questions in English, using direct speech ('Were we not frightned...', 'Did not a great many People shut themselves up...', 'And did not the learned Men write in vain...'), thus clarifying the events for the reader rather than leaving them nested in one sentence.","The philosophical and slightly ironic style of the original ('trop honteux pour les hommes', 'il devrait y avoir un Arrêt du Genre humain') is condensed and simplified in 'that's very disgraceful to Mankind; and I think there ought to be a Law made by universal Consent...', which omits the wordplay of 'Arrêt du Genre humain' (a decree of Humanity).","The French original features a more extended, nuanced reflection on the fact that everything in the world is a monument of human folly; the English translation simplifies and abbreviates it significantly, stating more directly, 'for I know of nothing, that is not a Monument of the Folly of Mankind,' losing the more ironical tone.","The French presents a long, playful speculation with several hypothetical clauses; the translation breaks it up, summarizes, and omits several details, rendering it into a shorter, more conversational tone, e.g. 'It seems to me very ridiculous, that some of 'em shou'd run into the Water up to the Neck...' and grouping the types of error by region. The English flattens the playful hypotheticals and does not mirror the extended buildup and comedic effect of the French.","A witty, layered French construction ('Je voudrais bien savoir pourquoy...', 'De quel droit...', 'Je croirois même...') that interleaves rational questioning with comic suggestion is presented in English as three shorter, more direct rhetorical questions and a plain statement, making the argument easier to follow by omitting the layered humor and subordination.","The French's complex clause ('mais comme il ne faut qu'un peu d'esprit & d'habileté dans les Gens de ce Pays-là, pour détruire tous ces honneurs dont nous nous flattons, j'avoüe que je crains toûjours que nous n'ayons quelque desavantage.') is significantly abridged and made more direct in 'But since there is only requisite, a little more Wit and Ingenuity in the Inhabitants of that Country, to blast the Honour we flatter our selves with, I confess, I am still apprehensive, they may have some Advantage over us,' which reduces the density and subtlety of the original.","The French phrase 'il n'y a pas d'apparence que nous soyons la seule sotte espèce de l'Univers...' is rendered in English with much more common vocabulary ('there is no likelihood that we are the only Fools of the Universe. Ignorance is naturally a very general Talent; and though I do but guess...'), simplifying both the philosophical assertion and its tone, moving from the original's ironic, careful prose to a familiar, colloquial assertion."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P032: Et quelles sont ces Nouvelles seures? interrompit-elle.

Je vous parle d'une des plus agréables folies de l'Arioste, &amp; je seuir sûr que vous serez bien aise de la savoir. J'avoüe qu'il eut mieux fait de n'y pas mêler Saint Jean, dont le nom est si digne de respect; mais enfin c'est une licence Poëtique, qui peut seulement passer pour un peu trop gaye.

Un jour Astolphe, brave Paladin, se trouva dans le Paradis Terrestre, qui étoit sur la cime d'une Montagne très haute, où son Hippogriffe l'avoit porté. Là il rencontre Saint Jean, qui luy dit que pour guerir la folie de Rolan, il étoit necessaire qu'ils fissent ensemble le Voyage de la Lune. Astolphe, qui ne demandoit qu'à voir du Pays, ne se fait point prier, &amp; aussi-tôt voilà un Chariot de feu qui enleve par les airs l'apôtre e&amp; le Paladin. Comme Astolphe n'étoit pas grand Philosophe, il fut fort surpris de voir la Lune beaucoup plus grande qu'elle ne luy avoit paru de dessus la Terre. Il fut bien plus surpris encore de voir d'autres fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forêts, &amp; ce qui m'aurait bien surpris aussi, des Nymphes qui chassoient dans ces Forêts. Mais ce qu'il vit de plus rare dans la Lune, c'étoit un Vallon où se trouvoit tout ce qui se perdoit sur la Terre, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">de quelque espèce qu'il fût, &amp; les Couronnes, &amp; les Richesses, &amp; la Renommée, &amp; une infinité d'Esperances, &amp; le temps qu'on donne au Jeu, &amp; les Aumônes qu'on fait faire aprés sa mort, &amp; les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes, &amp; les Soûpirs des Amans.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune. N'y eût-il que vous, Madame, repris-je en badinant, vous y avez fait aller tous ceux qu'on vous a adressez, &amp; c'est dequoy faire dans la Lune un amas considerable. Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin.</span></span> C'est que les Papes ont prétendu être Maîtres de Rome &amp; de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, &amp; la verité est qu'on ne sauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë. Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie. Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres bien conservé. En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, &amp; qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, &amp; sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient.

Il eut assez de peine à la porter; car l'Esprit de ce Heros etoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goutte. Ensuite, l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaît, apostrophe sa Maîtresse, &amp; lui dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'Esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allât pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon Esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les Airs, jusque dans la Lune, mon Esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur votre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en ressaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres.</span></span> Cela n'est-il pas joly? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdît jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le rattrape pas quand on veut.</span></span> En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-être icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">Mais pour achever de m'ôter le mien, dites-moy, &amp; dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune; car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une manière assez positive.

Voyez combien la face de la Nature est changée d'icy à la Chine; d'autres Visages, d'autres Figures, d'autres Moeurs, &amp; presque d'autres Principes de raisonnement. D'icy à la Lune le changement doit être bien plus considerable. Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine; qui pourrait pousser jusqu'à la Lune, assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit.</span></span> </p><p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise avec un air d'impatience? De bonne foy, Madame, repliquay-je, je n'en say rien. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, &amp; que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; &amp; si d'ailleurs nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eût ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures qu'on appelle le Genre humain? Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eût des passions si folles, &amp; des reflexions si sages; une durée si courte, &amp; des veües si longues, tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, &amp; tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, &amp; tant d'inclination à la Servitude; une si forte envie d'être heureux, &amp; une si grande incapacité de l'être? Il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela. Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mêmes, &amp; nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits. On a eté réduit à dire que les Dieux etoient plein de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes, &amp; que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sang froid, ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire.</span></span> Nous voila donc bien en seureté du côté des Gens de la Lune, dit la Marquise, ils ne nous devineront pas; mais je voudrais que nous les pussions deviner, car en verité cela inquiete, de savoir qu'ils sont là-haut, dans cette Lune que nous voyons, &amp; de ne pouvoir pas se figurer comment ils sont faits. Et pourquoi, rêpondis-je, n'avez-vous point d'inquietude sur les Habitans de cette grande Terre Australe qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Nous sommes portés eux &amp; nous sur un même Vaisseau dont ils occupent la Proüe, &amp; nous la Pouppe. Vous voyez que de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, &amp; qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font, &amp; vous voudriez savoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux?</span></span> </p><p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoîtra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connnoîtra jamais, cela est desesperant. Si je vous répondois sérieusement, répliquai-je, qu'on ne sait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moi, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres ridicule, qui a un air de vraisemblance qui me surprend, je ne say où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer, contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'etat où êtoit l'Amérique avant qu'elle eût eté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoître les Sciences, ils ne connoissaient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent être portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau êtoit sujet à être souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tôt à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, hormis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eût dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel côté &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrêter sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on êtoit maître de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fût, n'êtoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eût des Peuples au-delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu.</span></span> Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins attendu qui se présente à eux. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste.</span></span> D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pu les amener par dessus les mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieu? Sont-ce les Enfant du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Américains; mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir êté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eût dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Americains plus propres à être traversée?</span></span> En vérité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous êtes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Américains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pût se faire des chemins au travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connaissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pût aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, répliquai-je, on commence déjà à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la vérité ce n'a pas êté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont êté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naître, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajouter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siècles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi tôt le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mêtier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Americains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pût naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeât fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont êté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">Les gens de la Lune savent peut-être déjà faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sait quelle surprise.</span></span> Vous êtes insupportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celui-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sais bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">Les Anciens se tenoient bien sûrs que la Zone Torride Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur; &amp; du temps des Romains, la Carte generale de la Terre n'êtoit guère plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs très chauds, &amp; dans des Païs très froids. Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en êtoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la tête en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à être retenus dans nos jugements. Le Monde achevera peut-être de se déveloper pour nous, on connaîtra jusqu'à la Lune.</span></span> Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu notre habitation, il nous sera permis de connaître celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarrasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la vérité qui persuade, même sans avoir besoin de paraître avec toutes ses preuves. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois.</span></span> Ah! vous me soulagez, répliqua la Marquise, votre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of.</p> <p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse.</p> <p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</p> <p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</p> <p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn.

See what he treats of.</span></span> </p><p>P026: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers.</span></span></span></span> As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">(But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self.</span></span> The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after:</span></span> But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse. </p><p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</span></span> </p><p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases.</span></span> In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine. </p><p>P029: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there.</span></span> What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work.</span></span> We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us.</span></span> Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility:</span></span> nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men.</span></span> I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through?</span></span> Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us.</span></span> This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon.</span></span> Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it.</span></span> Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","explanations":["The translator condenses several complex French sentences into a more concise English introduction. The phrase 'Tout le Poëme est dédié à un Cardinal, e& un grand Pape l'a honoré d'une approbation éclatante que l'on voit au devant de quelques Editions. Voicy de quoy il s'agit.' is compressed and rephrased with less detail and a simpler sentence structure.","The English version condenses the French narrative, omitting some descriptive detail (e.g., skipping the specific naming of 'Hippogriffe' and simplifying 'qui luy dit que pour guerir la folie de Rolan, il étoit necessaire qu'ils fissent ensemble le Voyage de la Lune' into a much more compact phrase). Several events and their context are compacted for readability.","The aside '(Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin.)' is translated as '(But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there;' which simplifies the original and omits the reference to the Donation of Constantine in that sentence, instead referencing it earlier.","The enumeration of lost things ('de quelque espèce qu'il fût, & les Couronnes, & les Richesses, & la Renommée, ...') is visually condensed in English by listing fewer concrete details (notably omitting 'le temps qu'on donne au Jeu,' and collapsing details into broader terms like 'time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play').","The French describes in detail how each phial is labeled and prefers their arrangement in galleries, but the translator simplifies this with less intricate imagery, focusing on the main point and reducing the descriptive nuance.","The lengthy explanation about the narrator's own phial and the philosophical digression is rendered as two much shorter sentences in English, omitting the recursive clause structure and some of the humorous tone about 'tantôt Philosophiques, tantôt Poëtiques.'","The explanation of how Astolpho recovers his spirit—'par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie'—is dramatically shortened in English, which simply compares it to 'the Queen of Hungary's Water' and omits the detailed action and tone of the original.","The original French sentence contains several clauses and metaphors for where the speaker's spirit is, but the English version breaks this into shorter and simpler sentences, using 'however I do not believe...' for concision and removing some metaphoric complexity.","The philosophical point about only losing one's 'esprit' through love is shortened in English; the explanation is much more direct, and the wit of the original is dropped in favor of a clear, punchy statement.","In the English version, there is a simplification of the musing about the differences among Earth, China, and the Moon. The reasoning about degrees of difference is made more direct, omitting several transitional and qualifying phrases found in the French.","The enumeration of contradictory human traits ('des passions si folles, & des reflexions si sages; une durée si courte, & des veües si longues, ...') is rendered in English as a rapid list without the original's parallel structure and rhetorical crescendo, simplifying the stylistic complexity.","The metaphor about the ship's prow and stern is rephrased and condensed; the original French draws it out with repetition ('à un bout du Navire on ne sait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font'), but the English summarizes the idea succinctly by referencing simply 'they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication.'","The detailed account in French of how Americans perceived the sea and the process of building boats is compressed: nuanced descriptions about their perceptions are shortened and presented as more general features of ignorance or simplicity.","The description of the arriving Europeans is expanded for clarity in English but simultaneously simplifies the complex pile of metaphors and clauses in the French ('tout écaillez de fer, ..., & tenant en leur main des Foudres ...') by turning them into more direct images ('all crusted over with pollish'd Steel...carrying Thunder in their Hands').","The rhetorical question about the Americans' perception of traversability is shortened, removing the elaborate comparative structure and the subtlety of 'plus propres à être traversée.'","The English version compresses the staged speculation about the Moon's inhabitants and their progression in mastering flight into a couple of plain sentences, smoothing over tenses and conditions that appear in the French.","The French reflection on the growth of geographic knowledge is much more intricate, with several historical references and rhetorical asides ('ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, & beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre', 'Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre'). The English translation simplifies this entire paragraph, greatly reducing its density and rhetorical flourish.","The concluding sentence about the nature of truth is shortened in English; the French builds a cumulative effect with 'Elle entre si naturellement dans qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois,' which is simplified and generalized in English as 'it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it.'"]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">TROISIEME SOIR.

Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray.</span></span> Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, &amp; en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait.</span></span> Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint-Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint-Denis ressemble à Paris. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">Le soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalosons &amp; des vapeurs qui, montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irrégulierement autour de nôtre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantôt un Païs, tantôt un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changements sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dès qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait.</span></span> On verroit donc aussi ces mêmes changements sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voilà le malheur. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'élève point de vapeurs, ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que notre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs, elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement où il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux?</span></span> Et quoi, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste.</span></span> Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, répliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire.

Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la vérité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantôt une partie, tantôt une autre; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre êtaient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir être veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a resserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air où ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombet en pluyes. Mais ces mêmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mêmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour être imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mêmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-même, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées.</span></span> Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme notre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de notre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">Sur ce pied là, il faudra que la matière étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voilà ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance. Cela nous fournira des fruits, des blés, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons.

We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, as the Earth is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, without Variation or Change; there lies the difficulty: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are at from the Moon. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination and a Kindness for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling. It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon (for certainly it emits Vapours;) and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain: And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence; so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, with a little Knowledge; but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light; but I told her, 'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them.

The mystical nuance of 'confier nos chimeres' is made more literal and plain ('our Fancies and Notions'), and 'conversations savantes' becomes simply 'Philosophical Entertainment,' which is less rich and specific in meaning.","The English merges and smooths out the rapid alternation of statements and rhetorical questions from the French into a more streamlined explanation. The colourful expression 'Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy' and the process of overcoming 'la peine que j'y avois' are simplified and merged into less nuanced, plainer direction: 'You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it.' Several emotional undertones and subtleties are flattened.","The original French complex structure is reduced to a concise form. The English uses the imperative 'one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief...', whereas the French uses an extended rational reflection with subtler modal phrases: 'il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espèce que l'on croit, & en réserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse être admis, s'il en est besoin.' The English omits the embedded clause structure and condenses the meaning for easier readability.","The French phrase 'Je ne me paie point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait.' is translated as 'I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate:' The sharp idiomatic refusal 'Je ne me paie point de Sentences' is replaced with the more neutral and softened 'I am not to be deluded...with fair Words', losing the punchiness and tone of the original.","The sentence is greatly compressed in English; specifically, the description of clouds moving ('voltigent irrégulierement'), details about various countries being alternately shaded, and the listing of observational consequences is streamlined. The English renders it as: 'move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: And if it were possible for any one to see and consider the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes...' The cyclical and continuous shifting sense created by the French is less vivid, and the clauses about seeing 'taches' that change, assemble, or disappear are condensed.","The French covers multiple causalities and conditions related to exhalations, vapours, and the natural order with water in an extended, nested structure. In English, this is simplified: 'the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; and by consequence, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth...' Nearly all of the subtle explanatory sequence and justifications in the original are summarized in a briefer, more accessible chain, and the phrase about subtile parts separating and rising is rendered more plainly.","The rhetorical construct of the French ('Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, & de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux?') is simplified in English to 'Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water?' The English removes nuance and lyrical quality, using blunt, direct statements.","The nuanced French phrasing distinguishing 'ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-être que de grandes cavitez. De la distance où nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste.' is made much plainer: 'these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else but deep Caverns, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are at from the Moon.' The rhetorical register is notably lowered and made more straightforward.","The original French offers a technically detailed, multi-clause explanation of cloud formation and condensation; the English construes this more succinctly and with modernized vocabulary. The technical aspect about dispersion and subsequent condensation is rendered as 'sometimes it falls out... are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of small Dew...' The original's density and pacing are reduced.","The extended French parenthetical description about the unlikelihood of a perfectly solid lunar mass, referencing marble and hidden, invisible motion and external causes, is shortened and split into shorter sentences. The English skips the parenthetical structure and some repetitions, and instead provides a condensed chain of reasoning. Lyrical style and philosophical reflection are diminished for clarity.","The French uses a subtle, reflective chain for the logic of lunar habitability and subsistence, with several disclaimers and poetic asides ('à la maniere de la Lune que je fais profession de ne pas connoître, le tout proportionné aux besoins de ses Habitans, que je ne connais pas non plus.'). The English truncates this in briefer form: 'Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little.' The effect is a more streamlined, prosaic statement.","The witty French summation, involving a wordplay on 'beaucoup d'ignorance sur bien peu de science,' becomes flatly 'that is a great deal of Ignorance, with a little Knowledge; but we must have patience.' The phrase 'il faut s'en consoler; je suis encore trop heureuse...' is compressed to 'but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again...' which omits some expressive value and reorders the mood and style."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empêcher la communication des deux Planetes. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">S'il ne tenoit qu'à voler; que savons-nous, comme je vous disois hier, si on ne volera pas fort bien quelque jour?

The English merges these thoughts, drops 'comme je vous disois hier' in favor of the more general 'I discours'd of last Night,' and collapses the doubtful reflection into the simpler 'there seems but little likelihood of what I say,' thereby reducing density, nuance, and some referential complexity.","The French draws an explicit parallel between the 'air' of fish (water) and that of birds, with a more elaborate descriptive sequence about not passing from one 'air' to the other, and a poetic phrase 'chacun a pour prison l'air qu'il respire.' The English removes the repeated and intricate construction, uses the more common 'element' for clarity, and renders the 'prison' metaphor as 'confined,' simplifying vocabulary and imagery.","In French, the lunar inhabitant 'se noyeroit dés qu'il entreroit dans notre Air, & nous le verrions tomber mort sur la Terre,' which is direct but poetic. The translation elaborates to 'would be drown'd and suffocated as soon as they enter'd into our Air, and we shou'd see 'em fall dead upon the Earth,' adding 'suffocated' for clarity and spelling out the cause of death, thus shifting from the more stylistically restrained French to a plainer, explicit English rendering."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P043: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Oh, que j'aurois d'envie, s'écria la Marquise, qu'il arrivât quelque grand naufrage qui répandît icy bon nombre de ces Gens- là, dont nous irions considérer à notre aise les figures extraordinaires!</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">Mais répliquay-je, s'ils étoient assez habiles pour naviger sur la surface exterieure de notre Air, &amp; que de là par la curiosité de nous voir, ils nous pêchassent comme des Poissons, cela vous plairoit-il?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Pourquoy non, répondit-elle en riant?

You see therefore, that Nature has set many Bars and Fences, to hinder us from going out of our World, into that of the Moon. However, for our Satisfaction, let us conjecture and guess as much as we can of that world: For Example; I fansie that the Inhabitants of the Moon must see the Heavens, the Sun, and the Stars, of a different Colour than what they appear to us. All these Objects we see through a kind of natural Perspective-Glass, which changes them to us; this Perspective-glass of ours is mix'd with Vapours and Exhalations, which do not ascend very high. Some of late pretend, that the Air of it self is blew, as well as the Water of the Sea; and that that Colour is not apparent in the one, nor the other, but at a great depth: The Heavens, say they, in which are plac'd the fixed Stars, has of it self no Light; and by consequence, ought to appear black: But we see it through our Air, which is blew; and therefore the Heavens appear of that Colour. If it be so, the Beams of the Sun and Stars cannot pass through the Air, without taking a little of its Tincture, and at the same time lose as much of their own natural Colour: But supposing the Air had no Colour of it self, 'tis certain, that a Flambeau, seen at a distance, through a thick Fog, appears of a reddish Colour, tho' that be not natural to it; so all our Air, which is nothing else but a thick Fog, must certainly alter the true natural Colour of the Heavens, Sun and Stars to us; for nothing but the pure heavenly Substance is capable to convey to us Light and Colours, in their Purity and Perfection, as they are: So that the Air of the Moon is of another nature than our Air, or is, of it self, of an indifferent Colour; or, at least, is another Fog, changing, in appearance, the Colours of the Celestial Bodies.

The invitation for the Marquise's response is also expanded and made more direct with 'would that please you, Madam?'.","The explanation for why she would go into the nets is simplified: the explicit reasoning 'seulement pour avoir le plaisir de voir ceux qui m'auroient pêchée' is shortened to 'to have the satisfaction of seeing those that had caught me', omitting the more playful and hypothetical nuances of the original.","The original French sentence includes several clauses that explain how the air is less breathable at the top of some mountains and extends the complexity of why it's dangerous; the English reduces this to the essentials and provides a far more direct structure.","A long, intricate sentence in French is split and considerably restructured in English. The conditional logic ('ne disent aussi que...') is omitted and rephrased with direct assertions about the rarity and brevity of Genii visits, and the diving metaphor is made clearer and briefer, using phrases like 'few amongst them know how to dive' and compressing the whole speculative reasoning.","The metaphor of 'barrieres naturelles' is explained more simply as 'Bars and Fences', and the sentence is shortened; the complex verbs 'nous défendent la sortie... & l'entrée...' are rendered in the English as a single, straightforward inhibitory construction.","The French's 'Tâchons du moins pour notre consolation à deviner ce que nous pourrons de ce Monde-là' is made much more straightforward in English: 'However, for our Satisfaction, let us conjecture and guess as much as we can of that world:' removing the nuanced reasoning and copula.","The French conditional 'il faut qu'on y voye...' with its implication and hypothetical nuance is flattened in the English 'I fancy that the Inhabitants of the Moon must see...', moving from necessity/possibility to personal speculation.","'Lunette naturelle qui nous les change' is explained in English as 'natural Perspective-Glass, which changes them to us; this Perspective-glass of ours is mix'd with Vapours and Exhalations, which do not ascend very high.' The translation avoids the ambiguity of the original metaphor and rephrases it more transparently.","The English renders 'Quelques Modernes' as 'Some of late', both more informal and less specific, and simplifies the remainder by stating the point directly and removing the complex qualifying phraseology in French.","Sentence structure is simplified in English ('The Heavens, say they, in which are plac'd the fixed Stars, has of it self no Light...') with clauses reordered, and expository content made more direct than in French, which uses more connectors and subordination.","The French uses two sequential dependent clauses to describe how the air tints and alters rays; the English flattens this into 'If it be so... without taking a little of its Tincture, and at the same time lose as much of their own natural Colour', making the logical flow more linear and digestible.","The French uses a long and hypothetically structured sentence regarding fog and appearance, the English divides the point: it's first a statement of certainty, then a result, and uses the simple 'so all our Air... must certainly alter...' where the French is more circuitous and nuanced.","French: 'Il n'appartiendroit qu'à la matière céleste de nous apporter la lumiere & les couleurs dans toute leur pureté, & telles qu'elles sont.'

The expressions about 'assortir un habit, ou un meuble' are also modified to more familiar English idioms ('fitting of Furniture for a Room, or chusing a Garniture for a Suit of Cloths'). The clause 'la Nature a bien de l'esprit' is rendered simply as 'Nature is very ingenious,' omitting the nuance of wit or intelligence for a plainer descriptor, while the guarantee from the speaker is also made more direct.","The English translation condenses the complex syntactical structure of the French original into a more straightforward form, replacing 'Elle n'aura pas manqué de varier le Spectacle de l'Univers à chaque point de veüe diferent, & de le varier d'une manière toûjours agreable.' with 'she certainly has not fail'd of changing the Scene ... and still in a new and agreeable way.'

The alternation between light and darkness is more plainly depicted, reducing the poetic abruptness and complexity to a more straightforward narrative rhythm.","The source provides a detailed explanation of the rainbow's causes and a philosophical aside ('nous devons les plus belles choses du monde à celles qui le sont le moins'), but the translation condenses the causal chain and gives a less nuanced formulation, simplifying complex cause-effect phrasing and eliminating some richness (e.g., 'divers Reflections and Refections of the Sun-beams upon these Clouds' versus 'se forme dans les nuages d'ou tombent les pluyes').","'à quoy ressembleront les Belles de ce Pays-là? Quelle source de comparaisons perduë!' is rendered as 'To what then can the Lovers in the Moon compare their Mistresses, without these two things?' The playful reversal and lament for lost metaphors in French is reduced to a simpler, more direct rhetorical question, losing the nuance of 'source de comparaisons perdue' and the broader cultural reference."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P048: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Je n'aurois pas grand regret à ces comparaisons là, dit la Marquise, &amp; je trouve qu'on est assez bien recompense dans la Lune, de n'avoir ny Aurore ny Arc-en- ciel, car on ne doit avoir par la même raison ny Foudres ny Tonnerres, puisque ce sont aussi des choses qui se forment dans les nüages. On a de beaux jours toûjours serains pendant lesquels on ne perd point le Soleil de venë.

Peut-être aussi est-ce à cause de cela que la Nature a creusé dans la Lune des especes de Puits, qui sont assez grands pour être apperçus par nos Lunettes; car ce ne sont point des Vallées qui soient entre des Montagnes, ce sont des creux que l'on voit au milieu de certains lieux plats.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">Que sait-on si les Habitans de la Lune, incommodez par l'ardeur perpetuelle du Soleil, ne se refugient point dans ces grands Puits? Ils n'habitent peut-être point ailleurs, c'est là qu'ils bâtissent leurs Villes. Nous voyons icy que la Rome soûterraine êtoit presque aussi grande que la Rome qui est sur Terre. Il ne faudroit qu'ôter celle-cy, le reste seroit une Ville à la manière de la Lune.

Toute leur felicité consiste en ce qu'elles y entendent l'Harmonie que les Corps Celestes font par leurs mouvements; mais comme il pretend que quand la Lune tombe dans l'ombre de la Terre, elles ne peuvent plus entendre cette Harmonie; alors, dit-il, ces Ames crient comme des desesperées, &amp; la Lune se hâte le plus qu'elle peut de les tirer d'un endroit si fâcheux.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">Nous devrions donc, répliqua-t-elle, voir arriver icy les Bienheureux de la Lune, car apparemment on nous les envoye aussi; &amp; dans ces deux Planetes on croit avoir assez pourveu à la felicité des Ames, de les avoir transportées dans un autre Monde.</span></span> Serieusement, repris-je, ce ne seroit pas un plaisir mediocre de voir plusieurs Mondes differens.

Allons nous placer dans tous ces differens points de veuê, &amp; de là considérons l'Univers. N'avons- nous plus rien à voir dans la Lune? Je croy que non, répondis-je du moins je vous y ay fait voir tout ce qui êtoit de ma connoissance. Au sortir de la Lune en tirant vers le Soleil, on trouve Vénus. Sur Vénus je reprens le Saint-Denis. Vénus tourne sur elle-même, &amp; autour du Soleil comme la Lune, on découvre avec les Lunettes d'approche, que Vénus aussi bien que la Lune est tantôt en Croissant, tantôt en Décours, tantôt pleine selon les diverses situations où elle est à l'égard de la Terre. La Lune, selon toutes les apparences, est habitée, pourquoy Vénus ne le sera-t-elle pas aussi? Mais, interrompit-elle, en disant toüjours Pourquoy non, vous m'allez mettre des Habitans dans toutes les Planètes?

Il est vray, répondis-je, que dans le moment où vous venez de me surprendre, si vous m'eussiez contredit sur les Habitans des Planetes, non seulement je vous les aurois soutenus, mais je crois que je vous aurois dit comment ils êtoient tous faits. Il y a des momens pour croire, &amp; je ne les ay jamais si bien crûs que dans celuy là; presentement que je suis un peu plus de sens froid, je ne laisse pas de trouver qu'il seroit bien étrange que la Terre fût aussi habitée qu'elle l'est, &amp; que les autres Planètes ne le fussent point du tout; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">car ne croyez pas que nous voyions tout ce qui habite la Terre; il y a autant d'espèces d'Animaux invisibles que de visibles.

They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another. You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other? Seriously, said I, Madam, 'twould be a great Pleasure and Satisfaction to see several different Worlds; and I am often glad, to make these Journeys in Imagination; what joy then it wou'd be to do it in reality; that wou'd be far better than to travel from hence to Iapan, crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again. Well, said she, what hinders, but we shou'd make a Journey through the Planets as well as we can? Let us by imagination place our selves in several Positions, and situations, fit for considering the Universe. Have we no more to see in the Moon? No, said I, at least, I have shown you all I know. Going out of the Moon towards the Sun, the first Planet you meet with is Venus; and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis. Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, as the Moon does round the Earth; and by the means of Telescopes, we discover that Venus waxes and wanes, being sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened according to her different Positions in respect to the Earth.</p> <p>P037: By all appearance the Moon is inhabited, why shou'd not Venus be so, as well as she? Ay, but interrupted the Marquiese by your why nots, you will people all the Planets. Do not doubt of it, Madam, answer'd I; why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all? We see that all the Planets are of the same Nature, that they are all Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun; which they send one to another by Reflection, and that they have all the same kind of motion; thus far equal, and after all this must we conceive that all these vast Bodies were made not to be inhabited? And that Nature has made only an exception in Favor of the Earth, he that will believe this, may, but for my part I cannot. I find you, said the Marquiese, very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited. It is true, Madam, in the minute wherein you have surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me, as to the Inhabitants of all the Planets, I wou'd not only have defended my opinion, but have proceeded, to have given you an exact description of all the several Inhabitants of the Planets. There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it. The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there. And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates. If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,) and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures. Several Bodies, which appear to be solid, are nothing else but Collections or little heaps of these imperceptible Animals; who find there as much room, as is requisite for them to move in. The leaf of a Tree, is a little World inhabited, by such invisible little Worms: To them this leaf seems of a vast Extent, they find Hills and Valleys upon it: And there is no more Communication between the living Creatures on the one side, and those on the other, than between us and the Antipodes. And I think there is more reason, to believe a Planet (which is so vast a Body) to be inhabited. There has been found in several sorts of very hard Stones, infinite multitudes of little Worms, lodg'd all over them in insensible varieties; and who are nourish'd upon the Substance of these Stones which they eat. Consider the vast Numbers of these little Animals, and how long a tract of Years they have liv'd upon a grain of Sand. And by this Argument, tho my Moon were nothing but a confus'd heap of Marble Rocks, I wou'd rather make it be devour'd and consum'd by its Inhabitants, than to place none at all in it.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P036: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">I do much regret that loss, said the Marquiese, for in my Opinion, the Inhabitants of the Moon are fully recompens'd for the want of the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light, since for the same Reason, they have neither Thunder nor Lightning, both which are produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations; they enjoy bright serene Days, and never lose the Sun by Day, nor the Stars by Night.

Some descriptive elements are condensed, such as listing meteorological phenomena separately, and the phrase about losing 'the Sun de venë' and 'nights where stars do not show' is simplified to always seeing the Sun by day and the Stars by night. The condensed phrasing avoids some of the subtle nuance about the lunar sky's differences.","The English translation simplifies the speculation about the Moon's pits, omitting detailed explanation from the French ('ce ne sont point des Vallées...ce sont des creux que l'on voit au milieu de certains lieux plats') and condensing the idea into 'Caverns...big enough to be seen by our Telescopes.'","The translation abridges and streamlines the metaphor about subterranean Rome and the channels between people. It omits the more elaborate image of entire peoples in 'un Puits' and the careful analogy to antitype settlements, summarizing instead with 'Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another.'","The nuanced philosophical reversal about habitations on the surface is greatly condensed in the English, turning a complex chain of reasoning into a simple likelihood. The explicit logical steps of the French ('c'est tout le contraire, puisque...') are omitted and the statement is made more direct and colloquial.","The French 'je ne puis me resoudre à laisser vivre les Habitans de la Lune dans une obscurité perpetuelle' (I cannot bring myself to let the inhabitants of the Moon live in perpetual darkness) is simplified to 'I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness.' This omits the more emotional nuance of the French, which has a sense of internal struggle and concession.","The English explanation of the philosopher's view omits many details found in the French (e.g., 'leur felicité consiste en ce qu'elles y entendent l'Harmonie'... 'elles crient comme des desesperées, & la Lune se hâte le plus qu'elle peut de les tirer d'un endroit si fâcheux'), summarizing several actions and condensing the narrative into a briefer sequence, thus reducing its complexity.","The translator abridges and simplifies the French explanation about felicity and transportation of souls, turning a longer dual-planet description into a single rhetorical question and condensing two sentences into one.","The English translation switches the image of crawling painfully 'ramper avec beaucoup de peine' to 'crawling as it were with difficulty,' omitting the explicit and vivid comparison with only seeing men (pour ne voir que des hommes), and instead generalizing it to 'Men and Women.'","The English 'Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun...' omits the repeated statements about reflecting the light to each other and reduces the detailed enumeration found in the French. It summarizes the French more abstractly, streamlining the more verbose original.","The English significantly simplifies the stepwise description of animal sizes, omitting the metaphor of the mite (ciron) being the elephant among infinitely smaller animals, and the idea that there's a multitude for which the mite is an elephant.

Some nuance regarding the poetic epithets (Étoile du Berger, Mere des Amours) is reduced to more functional metaphors ('Fountain of Love', 'Source of their Amours').","The English omits the specification that these names can 'only' be given to planets with a 'galant air,' summarizing as 'most agreeable to the pretty, clear, twinkling Planets, which have ... an Air of Gallantry.' It then adds 'to give Laws to the Loves' (not in the original) and translates the succinct French 'ces Gens là doivent bien entendre la galanterie' as 'these People are very soft, and have the Art to please extreamly well,' which replaces the culturally specific term 'galanterie' with a simpler, more generic description.","The term 'le menu Peuple' is simplified to 'the very Mobile,' which is not a direct cultural equivalent.

The phrase 'ils sont encore plus proches du Soleil; il faut qu'ils soient fous à force de vivacité' is generalized to 'They must certainly be mad, by having too much Light and Fire', reducing the nuance and complexity of the original observation about their vivacity. The metaphor 'Petites Maisons de l'Univers' (a reference to hospitals for the insane in France) is simplified to 'the Bethlem of the Universe', which, while keeping a cultural reference to insanity, omits some of the layered cultural nuance from the French context.","The original French segment is one long sentence filled with qualifiers. The translation splits this into several shorter and more direct sentences, each conveying a single idea, thus simplifying the complex structure. Furthermore, the phrase 'ils ne prendroient nos plus beaux jours que pour de très foibles Crepuscules, & peut-être n'y pourroient-ils pas distinguer les objets' is rendered as 'would take our finest Days for the Remains of a saint Twi-light; and it may be, the Light we enjoy, wou'd not serve them to distinguish one Object from another,' dropping the uncertainty and subtlety ('peut-être') for a more assertive presentation.","The French description is a dense compound sentence with multiple embedded clauses and reasons. The translation reorders and distills these ideas, moving from the complicated 'qu'il échappe à toute l'adresse des Astronomes, & qu'on n'a pû encore avoir assez de prise sur lui, pour observer le mouvement qu'il doit avoir sur son centre' to 'hitherto scarce discoverable by the Art and Skill of Astronomers, who cou'd never yet get so much hold of Mercury, as to observe the Time in which he performs his Revolution upon his own Axis or Centre.' The English uses more familiar words and shorter clauses, making the entire explanation more immediately comprehensible.","Where the French says 'Ils sont éclairez pendant ce temps-là de Vénus, & de la Terre, qui leur doivent paroître assez grandes. Pour les autres Planètes, comme elles sont au-delà de la Terre vers le Firmament, ils les voyent plus petites que nous ne les voyons, & n'en reçoivent que bien peu de lumière, peut-être n'en reçoivent-ils point du tout', the translation collapses and reorders the information, resulting in shorter, less nuanced statements (e.g. 'they are enlightned by Venus, and by the Earth; which two Planets must appear to them of considerable bigness. ...receive but little Light from 'em, it may be, none at all;'). The dependency structure and subtle shifts in possibility ('peut-être n'en reçoivent-ils point du tout') are simplified.","The multi-layered French complaint about losing stars, rich with qualifiers, is rendered as two shorter sentences. The concluding French phrase ('que plus petites, & d'une couleur plus effacée') is flattened in English ('appear less, and not so bright'), losing some of the subtlety regarding the stars’ faded color. The translation simplifies the overall sentiment and reduces stylistic complexity."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P059: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">Je ne suis pas si touchée, dit la Marquise, de cette perte-là que sont les Habitans de Mercure, que de l'incommodité qu'ils reçoivent de l'excés de chaleur.

This reduces the poetic nuance of 'animer tout par sa chaleur' and emphasizes plain causality.","The French original expresses nuance about the change in opinion regarding the sun as pure fire with 'mais on s'en desabusa au commencement de ce Siecle, qu'on aperceut des taches sur sa surface.' The English simplifies this to 'but the Error of this Opinion was found out in the Beginning of this Age, by Spots which were discover'd...' condensing the structure and making the process more direct, with less subtlety about scientific disabusement.","The English translation divides the long and syntactically complex French sentence about the discovery of new planets and the fashion for discussing them into several shorter, more readable sentences. The essence is retained but the network of causal and temporal clauses is unraveled into simpler constructs, simplifying the literary complexity.","Where the French expands humorously upon the rivalry and the potential for quarrels among the scholars for naming rights ('peut-être il y auroit eu querelle entre-eux à qui seroit demeuré le maître des taches pour les nommer comme il eût voulu...'), the English truncates this with 'so that they were like to quarrel, to whom they shou'd belong,' omitting the detailed scenario and playful tone, thus simplifying the narrative."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P062: Je ne trouve point cela bon, interrompit la Marquise.

But, pray, Madam, allow me to tell you, that you who have corrected me so justly, may also be mistaken your self: The Inhabitants of the Sun wou'd not so much as see it self; for they wou'd be incapable to support the dazling of his Light, or unable to receive it, by being too near; and all things well consider'd, the Sun wou'd be a Country of blind Men only. So that, once for all, I conclude, the Sun cannot be inhabited; and if you please, Madam, we will continue our Journey to the other Worlds: We are now come to the Centre, which is the lowest Point in all Circular Figures; and therefore must return back again, and go upwards. In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited.</p> <p>P049: The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and his Inhabitants see the Sun neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or Guards: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light.

In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited. </p><p>P049: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and his Inhabitants see the Sun neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"1\">but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or Guards: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us.</span></span> But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"2\">why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun.</span></span> Ah, Madam! said I; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"3\">if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate.</span></span> Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"4\">But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"5\">As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way:</span></span> You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"6\">all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune.</span></span> Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China.</span></span> You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up.</span></span> So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The translator breaks up the longer French description of Mars into shorter, more explicit sentences, omitting the phrase 'il est cinq fois plus petit que la Terre' and condensing the content for easier comprehension.

The sentiment about 'mesure de bonheur' is also condensed, making the overall passage easier to follow.","The original French, 'Si on ne vouloit que des plaisirs vifs, on en auroit peu, on les attendroit long-temps, & on les payeroit bien,' is restructured in English as 'If we shou'd look after no other Pleasure or Satisfaction, than this World afforded, we shou'd enjoy but very few, expect 'em long, and pay dear for 'em,' which omits the expression 'plaisirs vifs,' generalizing 'pleasures' and simplifying vocabulary.","The conditional and somewhat playful exchange in French is simplified in English; rather than referencing specifically 'ces plaisirs vifs' and the promise to remember both Tourbillons and the speaker, the translation makes the conditional about Philosophy as the pleasure, and the request to 'be pleased to think of me' is a clear replacement for the more subtle original.","The French replies simply and concisely: 'Ouy, répondit-elle, mais faites que la Philosophie me fournisse toûjours des plaisirs nouveaux.' The English adds further clarity with 'provided you take care your Philosophy furnishes me always with new Pleasures,' removing the subtlety of the request and clarifying the conditional expectation for the reader.","The French final promise contains a subtlety: 'J'ai des Etoiles fixes qui passent tout ce que vous avez vu jusqu'icy.' The English expands and clarifies this idea: 'I have the fixed Stars prepared for you, which surpass all you have hitherto heard,' making the intent more active and straightforward, and replacing the metaphorical 'passent tout ce que vous avez vu' with 'surpass all you have hitherto heard.'"]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P085: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"0\">CINQUIEME SOIR.

The detailed reasoning about reflection and loss of light is partly elided for readability.","Several rhetorical questions in the French are compressed into fewer, more straightforward questions and statements in English, which flattens the structure and removes some of the buildup and nuance present in the original.","The English version streamlines the sentence structure, breaking up longer and more intricate French sentences into shorter, more direct ones. Also, expressions such as 'je respire avec plus de liberté' and 'je suis dans un plus grand air' are condensed into 'I am at more Liberty, and breath a freer Air.' This makes the contemplative and poetic structure of the original more prosaic and accessible.","This English rendering simplifies the original by clarifying in plainer terms that planets outside one's own Tourbillon cannot be seen, while omitting some of the descriptive richness and circumlocution present in the French (notably 'ils n'ont garde d'en voir les Planetes...' is converted to 'but cannot discover the Planets of another').","The philosophical reflection about difficulties distinguishing among worlds is reduced and phrasing is smoothed into more transparent, shorter sentences, omitting some specific nuances such as 'à qui la même expression convient, avoüez que vous ne sauriez presque plus nous déméler au milieu de tant de Mondes'.","The English text summarizes and paraphrases the repetitive rhetorical structure of the French ('si on a tant d'ardeur de s'agrandir...'), simplifying and listing specific examples of human efforts without preserving the original's rhythm and formality.","The English translation uses plainer wording and rephrases the justification for indolence and 'reprocher mon indolence' to 'my carelesness shall have this Advantage by my Knowledge', making the reasoning more accessible and faster to understand.","The translator rephrases and consolidates the anecdote about Aristotle, Alexander, and the concealment of astronomical truths. The English text is less formal and more colloquial, compressing the rationale and narrative flow, while omitting asides and rhetorical flourishes about 'faire sa Cour' and the risk of displeasing Alexander.","The concluding meditation simplifies some of the nuanced wit concerning beauty and the limited effect of cosmic reflection on human concerns.

The structure about how each Tourbillon moves ('Ils s'engrainent en quelque façon les uns dans les autres comme les rouës d'une Montre, & aident mutuellement leurs mouvements.

N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"7\">Je vous diray, si vous voulez, répondis je, ce que disent de fort habiles Gens, que les Etoiles Fixes qui ont disparu ne sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est-à-dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mêmes, tantôt ils nous présentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantôt la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"8\">Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion-là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoître, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"9\">Mais que dirons nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mêmes? Vous êtes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en votre faveur.</span></span> Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles Fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantôt plus grandes tantôt plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus légers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur. Il y a des Etoiles Fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroître &amp; disparoître, &amp; enfin disparoissent entièrement, des demi-Soleils reparoîtraient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoîtroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoître de longtemps. Prenez votre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'être visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"10\">Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en lui-même une source de lumière?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"11\">Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, notre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des brouillards ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces tâches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toûjours, &amp; adieu le Soleil.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"12\">Nous l'avons déja même échepée, dit-on. Le Soleil a été très pâle pendant des années entières, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'étoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire; la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa, mais si elle eût continué, nous étions perdus.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"13\">Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je say les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pâle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"14\">Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde.</span></span> Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris- je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"15\">Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers, est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changements, soit lents, soit prompts, mais toûjours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"16\">Les Anciens êtaient plaisants de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoient pas encore vû changer. Avoient-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'expérience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"17\">Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se loissent des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoient suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela, elles diroient nous avons toûjours vû le même Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours êté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroîtroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir notre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité.</span></span> Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"18\">Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses même qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attends bien que s'il disparoît des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroît de nouvelles, il faut que l'espce se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je.</span></span> Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir eté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"19\">D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démefez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je crois aisément que tout cela peut être, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir êté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir êté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différents, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondements d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature. N'auroit-elle le secret que de faire naître &amp; mourir des herbes ou des plantes par une revolution continuelle? Je suis persuadé, &amp; vous l'êtes déja aussi, qu'elle pratique ce même secret sur les Mondes, &amp; qu'il ne luy en coûte pas davantage.</span></span> De bonne foy, dit la Marquise, je trouve à present les Mondes, les Cieux, &amp; les Corps celestes si sujets au changement, que m'en voila tout à fait revenuë. Revenons encore mieux, si vous m'en croyez, répliquai-je, n'en parlons plus, aussi bien vous voila arrivée à la derniere voûte des Cieux; &amp; pour vous dire s'il y a encore des Etoiles au-delà, il faudroit être plus habile que je ne suis. Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">C'est proprement l'Empire des Philosophes que ces grands païs invisibles qui peuvent être ou n'être pas si on veut, ou être tels que l'on veut, il me suffit d'avoir mené vôtre esprit aussi loin que vont vos yeux.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P074: I understand you, said she, and am pleas'd with your Chamber of State; for we do not permit 'em to come directly in the middle of our Tourbillion, but receive 'em as the Grand Seignior does his Foreign Ministers; he does 'em not the Honour to lodge 'em in Constantinople, but sends 'em to the Suburbs. Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or false Light. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! after a long Sea-Voyage. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light? The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, and then farewell the Sun and all its Light. 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect. The Ancients were foolish to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience; but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener, but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is: Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever, yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? Eternity is not so easy a matter; and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish. Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them. If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other. Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie.

Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text LS\" data-index=\"20\">These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie.

The invitation to imagine whatever one wishes is simplified and the original's meta-literary flourish is largely lost."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P105: Quoi, s'écria-t-elle, j'ay dans la tête tout le systeme de l'Univers!
