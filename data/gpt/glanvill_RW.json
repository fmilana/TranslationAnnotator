Il faisoit un frais délicieux, qui nous récompensoit d'une journée fort chaude que nous avions essuyée. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement.</span></span> La Lune estoit levée il y avoit Page 8] peut-estre une heure, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist la moyndre Etoile; elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées.</span></span> Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles.</span></span> Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit? Oüi, me répondit-elle, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"13\">Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"14\">J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"15\">Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"16\">Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée. Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle? Helas, repliquay-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"17\">Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Et bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la-moy, je croiray sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, repliquay-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

'Tis the Night, Madam, said I, that crowns their Joys, and therefore deserves their thanks. But 'tis the Night, said she, that hears their Complaints, and how comes it to pass, the day is so little trusted with their secrets? I confess, Madam, said I, the night hath somewhat a more melancholly Air, than the day; we fancy the Stars march more silently than the Sun, and our thoughts wander with the more liberty, whilst we think all the world at rest but our selves: Besides, the day is more uniform, we see nothing but the Sun, and light in the Firmament; whilst the night gives us variety of Objects, and shews us ten thousand Stars, which inspire us with as many pleasant Ideas. What you say is true, said she, I love the Stars, there is somewhat charming in them, and I could almost be angry with the Sun for effacing 'em.

This alters the rhetorical focus from the narrator's self-awareness to a general statement, clarifying and foregrounding the implicit social situation.","The French describes the specific colors ('un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir'). The translation makes this more general, referring to 'a mixture of Light and Darkness', which actually reduces the specificity but introduces the implicit contrast more overtly. The explicit reference to light and darkness makes the opposition more conceptually explicit rather than visually descriptive.","The original French gives poetic details of the stars as 'd'un or pur & éclatant... relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées.' The English translator instead says 'the Stars were in all their Glory... on the Azure Sky,' making explicit the sense of grandeur and beauty while omitting the details about 'gold' and 'attached'. The explicit general praise emphasises their glory rather than their specific color or the background.","The translator makes explicit the point that it's difficult to think of the moon and stars when in the company of a pretty woman, which was only implied in the French ('mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune & aux Etoiles'). The translation states plainly, 'but who can think long of the Moon and Stars, in the Company of a Pretty Woman!' changing the rhetorical style.","The translation turns the metaphorical comparison ('la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde... la nuit est une Beauté brune') into a more explicit, structured simile: 'like a fair Beauty...like a brown Beauty', adding adjectives 'clear and dazzling', 'soft and moving', which are more explicit than the French 'plus de brillant' and 'plus touchante'.","The French text has an indirect compliment ('vous qui ne l'estes pas'), which could be ambiguous, but the translation makes it explicit: 'You that have all the Charms that belong to the Fair', clarifying that the interlocutor is herself 'Fair'.","The explanation about the heroines of romances implicitly presents the superiority of 'blondes'; the English makes it more explicit, stating 'that Beauty must be perfect, which hath all the advantages of imagination', an interpretive expansion that spells out the connection between perfect beauty, 'blondes', and heroines of romance.","The translator omits several intervening lines, but in moving to 'But since you talk of Romances, why do Lovers in their Songs and Elegies address themselves to the Night?', he explicitly introduces the connection to the topic at hand, making the implicit relation between the beauty of the night and the traditions of lovers and poetry explicit.","Where the French refers to a certain sadness and passion ('qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste & de passionné'), the English says 'the night hath somewhat a more melancholly Air, than the day', making the affective tone more overt and unambiguous.","The French says 'il semble... que tout soit en repos', but the translation states directly: 'whilst we think all the world at rest but our selves', making the implicit idea of solitude more personally and explicitly described.","The French suggests stars disposed 'au hazard en mille figures diferentes', favoring dreams and reverie with 'un certain desordre de pensées...'. The English spells this out with 'the night gives us variety of Objects, and shews us ten thousand Stars, which inspire us with as many pleasant Ideas', making the connection between the stars and their effect on the mind more explicit.","The French says 'je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface', which means she would complain about the Sun erasing the stars. The English places blame directly—'I could almost be angry with the Sun for effacing 'em', which shifts implicit disapproval into an explicit emotional response.","The French states 'Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes.' and 'Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes...?' The English combines and makes clearer the focus: 'I can never pardon him, I cry'd, for keeping all those Worlds from my sight: What Worlds, said she, looking earnestly upon me, what Worlds do you mean?', clarifying the pondering into a more dramatic exchange and making the rhetorical question more explanatory.","Where the French 'je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde' is a modest speculation, the English makes it personal and insistent: 'I have had a strong Fancy every Star is a World'. It is more direct, and the following 'tis a fancy come into my head, and is very diverting' spells out the subjective pleasure more than the French's 'qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante.'","The French 'donnez-la-moy, je croiray sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir' is a metaphorical offer to accept the pleasure of the other's folly; the English translation makes the process of being convinced and the pleasure's condition explicit: 'Pray make me sensible of it; provided the Pleasure be so great, I will believe of the Stars all you would have me.'","The French closes with reluctance couched in terms of reputation and the setting ('il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir...'). The English instead states: 'it shall never be said I was talking Philosophy at ten of the Clock at Night, to the most amiable Creature in the World, find your Philosophers somewhere else.', which is more personalized and direct about the social impropriety of talking philosophy at night with a lady."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P003: J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne sçavois par où commencer mon discours; car <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">avec une personne comme elle qui ne sçavoit rien en matiere de Phisique</span></span>, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit estre une Planete; &amp; les Planetes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les Etoiles des Mondes. J'en revenois toûjours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en nostre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay.</span></span> </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes; &amp; si d'un autre costé vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le sçavoir, ce qui reviendrait au mesme. Mais on veut sçavoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est-là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera. Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiete d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien, qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers; car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">tant de bruit dans nos oreilles</span></span>. Suposons qu'ils voyoient le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent, qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; &amp; cent autres resveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité.</span></span> A la fin <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Descartes, &amp; quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera.</span></span> A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique? Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Avoüez la verité. N'avez-vous point eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne meritoit? J'ay vû des gens qui l'en estimoyent moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoyent connu.</span></span> Et moy, repliqua-t-elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sçay qu'il ressemble à une Montre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P004: But in vain I excus'd my self, who could resist so many Charms? I was forc'd to yield, and yet I knew not where to begin; for to a Person who understood nothing of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">Natural Philosophy</span></span> you must go a great way about to prove that the Earth may be a Planet, the Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars worlds; however to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I at last resolv'd on this Method. All Philosophy, said I, Madam, is founded upon two things, either that we are too short sighted, or that we are too curious; for if our eyes were better than they are, we should soon see whether the Stars were worlds or not; and if on the other side we were less curious, we should not care whether the Stars are Worlds or not, which I think is much to the same purpose. But the business is, we have a mind to know more than we see: And again, if we could discern well what we do see, it would be so much known to us: But we see things quite otherwise than they are. So that your true Philosopher will not believe what he doth see, and is alwaies conjecturing at what he doth not, which is a Life I think not much to be envy'd: Upon this I fancy to my self, that Nature very much resembleth an Opera, where you stand, you do not see the Stage as really it is; but it is plac'd with advantage, and all the Wheels and Movements are hid, to make the Representation the more agreeable: Nor do you trouble your self how, or by what means the Machines are moved, tho' certainly an Engineer in the Pit is affected with what doth not touch you; he is pleas'd with the motion, and is demonstrating to himself on what it depends, and how it comes to pass. This Engineer then is like a Philosopher, tho' the difficulty is greater on the Philosophers part, the Machines of the Theatre being nothing so curious as those of Nature, which disposeth her Wheels and Springs so out of sight, that we have been long a guessing at the movement of the Universe. Suppose then the Sages at an Opera, the Pithagoras's, the Plato's, the Aristotles, and all the Wise Men who have made such a noise in the World, for these many Ages: We will suppose 'em at the Representation of Phaeton, where they see the aspiring Youth lifted up by the Winds, but do not discover the Wires by which he mounts, nor know they any thing of what is done behind the Scenes. Would you have all these Philosophers own themselves to be stark Fools, and confess ingenuously they know not how it comes to pass: No, no, they are not called Wise Men for nothing; tho', let me tell you, most of their Wisdom depends upon the ignorance of their Neighbours. Every man presently gives his Opinion, and how improbable so ever, there are Fools enough of all sorts to believe 'em: One tells you Phaeton is drawn up by a hidden Magnetick Vertue, no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question. Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra: A third tells you, Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company, with an hundred such extravagant fancies, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers</span></span>: But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera. I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it; they will have the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement. But pray tell me, Madam, had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe? Do you not think you did then honour it more than it deserv'd?

But the business is, we have a mind to know more than we see: And again, if we could discern well what we do see, it would be so much known to us: But we see things quite otherwise than they are. So that your true Philosopher will not believe what he doth see, and is alwaies conjecturing at what he doth not, which is a Life I think not much to be envy'd: Upon this I fancy to my self, that Nature very much resembleth an Opera, where you stand, you do not see the Stage as really it is; but it is plac'd with advantage, and all the Wheels and Movements are hid, to make the Representation the more agreeable: Nor do you trouble your self how, or by what means the Machines are moved, tho' certainly an Engineer in the Pit is affected with what doth not touch you; he is pleas'd with the motion, and is demonstrating to himself on what it depends, and how it comes to pass. This Engineer then is like a Philosopher, tho' the difficulty is greater on the Philosophers part, the Machines of the Theatre being nothing so curious as those of Nature, which disposeth her Wheels and Springs so out of sight, that we have been long a guessing at the movement of the Universe. Suppose then the Sages at an Opera, the Pithagoras's, the Plato's, the Aristotles, and all the Wise Men <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">who have made such a noise in the World, for these many Ages</span></span>: We will suppose 'em at the Representation of Phaeton, where they see the aspiring Youth lifted up by the Winds, but do not discover the Wires by which he mounts, nor know they any thing of what is done behind the Scenes. Would you have all these Philosophers own themselves to be stark Fools, and confess ingenuously they know not how it comes to pass: No, no, they are not called Wise Men for nothing; tho', let me tell you, most of their Wisdom depends upon the ignorance of their Neighbours. Every man presently gives his Opinion, and how improbable so ever, there are Fools enough of all sorts to believe 'em: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">One tells you Phaeton is drawn up by a hidden Magnetick Vertue, no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question. Another says, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount; and after all, the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra: A third tells you, Phaeton hath a secret love for the top of the Theatre, and like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company, with an hundred such extravagant fancies, that a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good Banterers:</span></span> But now comes <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Monsieur Descartes, with some of the Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera.</span></span> I perceive, said the Countess, Philosophy is now become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall quickly be asham'd of it; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">they will have the World to be in great, what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">But pray tell me, Madam, had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe?

This is an explicitation of historical context.","The source expresses the difficulty of explaining such concepts to a novice, but the translation adds 'you must go a great way about' and condenses the struggle, making the necessity of explanation more explicit and generalizing this instructional position, rendering the implicit pedagogical intent more overt.","'tant de bruit dans nos oreilles' literally refers to the names 'making so much noise in our ears', but the translation renders this as 'who have made such a noise in the World, for these many Ages,' making explicit that it refers to the historical fame and ongoing influence of these philosophers beyond mere reputation.","The translator expands and clarifies the implications behind each philosopher's fanciful explanation of Phaeton's ascent with elaborations like 'no matter where it lies; and perhaps the grave Gentleman will take pet, if you ask him the Question' and 'the Philosopher knows no more of those numbers than a sucking Child of Algebra' and 'like a true Lover cannot be at rest out of his Mistresses Company,' spelling out the satire and the folly in greater detail than the original, which remains more allusive. The phrase 'Old Sages were very good Banterers' makes explicit a critical tone only implied in the French.","The translation unpacks the technical mechanism by adding 'so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the Opera.' This spells out the application of the mechanical system in more explicit, didactic language that makes the underlying scientific principle clearer to the lay reader compared to the more concise original.","Where the French describes the universe as a watch in miniature ('une Montre est en petit'), the English translation explicitly states, 'what a Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just disposing of the several parts of the movement.' This expands the analogy by making explicit what is meant by the watch's regularity and functioning, which in French is only implied.","The translator adds, 'Do you not think you did then honour it more than it deserv'd? For most have the less esteem of it since they have pretended to know it.' This brings out the implication, only suggested in the French, that people have less esteem for the universe since claiming to know it, making the psychological and philosophical shift explicit.","The English version adds 'and the whole order of Nature the more plain and easie it is, to me it appears the more admirable,' making explicit that the universe's simplicity makes it more admirable to the speaker—while the French merely notes it as surprising that such admirable order is based on simple things."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P005: Je ne sçay pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en verité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir.

La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus interessée que je ne l'ay, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne, &amp; nous y menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraye vie pastorale que de parler des Planetes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaist, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries.</span></span> L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus.</span></span> Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide.</span></span> Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres.</span></span> Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution.</span></span> Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule.</span></span> Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoyent esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pieces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvemens qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux.</span></span> Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre. </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabatu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes. Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez-vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"12\">je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celuy qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préseance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs.</span></span> Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-estre sans s'en appercevoir, ce principe qui le flate, &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'interesser à une affaire de pure speculation. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"11\">Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'auroit donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant.</span></span> Aussi, repris-je, Copernic luy-mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long-temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez-vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire. Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avois laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au-delà de tous les Cercles des Planetes sont les Etoiles fixes, Voila nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois necessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voye répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce Cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air sçavant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait. N'ay-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoyent, en voyant de certaines figures de Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voye icy.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, 'tis not a true Shepherds life to talk of the Stars and Planets: See if they pass their time so in Astrea. That sort of Shepherds Craft, reply'd she, is too dangerous for me to learn: I love the honest Caldaeans, and you must teach me their Rules, if you would have me improve in their Science. But let us proceed, When they had rank'd the Heavens in that manner you tell me, pray, what is the next Question? The next, said I, is the disposing the several parts of the Universe, which the Learned call making a Systeme; but before I expound the first Systeme, I would have you observe, we are all naturally like that Mad man at Athens, who fancy'd all the Ships were his that came into the Port Pyroeum: Nor is our Folly less extravagant, we believe all things in Nature design'd for our use; and do but ask a Philosopher, to what purpose there is that prodigious company of fix'd Stars, when a far less number would perform the service they do us? He answers coldly, they were made to please our Sight. Upon this Principle they imagin'd the Earth rested in the Centre of the Universe, while all the Celestial Bodies (which were made for it) took the Page 15 pains to turn round to give light to it. They plac'd the Moon above the Earth, Mercury above the Moon, after Venus the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, above all these they set the Heaven of fix'd Stars, the Earth was just in the middle of those Circles which contain the Planets, and the greater the Circles were, they were the farther distant from the Earth, and by consequence the farthest Planets took up the most time in finishing their course, which in effect is true: But why, said the Countess, interrupting me, do you dislike this Systeme? It seems to me very Clear and Intelligible. However, Madam, said I, I will make it plainer; for should I give it you as it came from Ptolomy its Author, or from some who have since study'd it, I should fright you, I fancy, instead of diverting you. Since the Motions of the Planets are not so regular, but that sometimes they go faster, sometimes slower, sometimes are nearer the Earth, and sometimes farther from it; the Ancients did invent I do not know how many Orbs or Circles involv'd one within another, which they thought would salve all Objections; this confusion of Circles was so great, that at that time when they knew no better, a certain King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but not much troubled with Religion, said, That had God consulted him when he made the World, he would have told him how to have fram'd it better. The fancy was very Atheistical, and no doubt the Instructions he would have given the Almighty, was the suppressing those Circles with which they had clog'd the Celestial Motions, and the taking away two or three superfluous Heavens which they had placed above the fixed Stars; for these Philosophers to explain the Motion of the Celestial Bodies, had above the uppermost Heaven (which we see,) found another of Crystal, to influence and give Motion to the inferiour Heavens; and wherever they heard of another Motion, they presently clapp'd up a Crystal Heaven which cost 'em Page 17 nothing. But why must their Heaven be of Crystal, said the Countess, would nothing else serve as well? No, no, I reply'd, nothing so well; for the Light was to come thro' them, and yet they were to be solid. Aristotle would have it so, he had found Solidity to be one of their Excellencies, and when he had once said it, no body would be so rude as to question it. But it seems there were Comets much higher than the Philosophers expected, which as they pass'd along brake the Crystal Heavens, and confounded the Universe. But to make the best of a bad Market, they presently melt down their broken Glass, and to Aristotles Confusion, made the heavens fluid; and by the observations of these latter Ages it is now out of doubt, that Venus and Mercury turn round the Sun, and not round the Earth, according to the Antient Systeme, which is now every where exploded, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">all the Ipse Dixits not worth a rush</span></span>. But that which I am going to lay down, will salve all, and is so clear, that the King of Arragon himself may spare his Advice. Methinks, saith the Countess, your Philosophy is a kind of Out-cry, where he that offers to do the work cheapest, carries it from all the rest. 'Tis very true, said I, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">Nature is a great Huswife, she always makes use of what costs least</span></span>, let the difference be never so inconsiderable; and yet this frugality is accompany'd with an extraordinary magnificence, which shines thro' all her works; that is, she is magnificent in the design, but frugal in the Execution; and what can be more praise worthy, than a great design accomplish'd with a little Expence? But in our Ideas we turn things topsy-turvy, we place our thrift in the design, and are at ten times more charge in Workmanship than it requires, which is very ridiculous: Imitate Nature then, saith she, in your Systeme, and give me as little trouble as you can to comprehend you. Fear it not, Madam, said I, we have done with our impertinencies: Imagine then a German all'd Copernicus confounding every thing, earing in pieces the beloved Circles of Antiquity, and shattering their Crystal Heavens like so many Glass Windows, seiz'd with the noble Rage of Astronomy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\">he snatcheth up the Earth from the Centre of the Universe, sends her packing,</span></span> and placeth the Sun in the Centre to which it did more justly belong, the Planets no longer turn round the Earth, and do not inclose it in the Circles they describe; if they give us light, it is but by chance, and as they meet us in their way. All now turns round the Sun, the Earth her self goes round the Sun, and Copernicus to punish the Earth for her former Lazyness, makes her contribute all he can to the motion of the Planets and Heavens, and now stripp'd of all the heavenly Equipage with which she was so gloriously attended, she hath nothing left her but the Moon, which still turns round about her: Fair and softly, saith the Countess, I fancy you your self are seiz'd with the Noble Fury of Astronomy; a little less Rapture, and I shall understand you the better. The Sun You say is in the Centre of the Universe, and is immovable; what follows next? It is Mercury, said I, he turns round the Sun, so that the Sun is the Centre of the Circle wherein Mercury moves; above Mercury is Venus, who turns also round the Sun; after comes the Earth, which being placed higher than Mercury and Venus, makes a greater circle round the Sun than either of them; at last come Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, in the same order I name 'em, so that Saturn hath the greatest circle round the Sun, which is the reason he is a longer time in making his Revolution than any of the other Planets. And the Moon, you have forgot her, said she: We shall quickly find her again, said I; the Moon turns round the Earth, and doth not leave her, but as the Earth advanceth in the Circle, which she describes about the Sun, and if the Moon turns round the Sun, it is because she will not quit the Earth; I understand you, said she, and I love the Moon for staying with us when all the other Planets do abandon us; nay, I fear your German would have willingly taken her away too if he could, for in all his proceedings, I find he had a great spight to the Earth. 'Twas well done of him, said I, to abate the Vanity of Mankind, who had taken up the best place in the Universe, and it pleaseth me to see the Earth in the croud of the Planets. Sure, said she, you do not think their Vanity extends it self as far as Astronomy! Do you believe you have humbled me, in telling me the Earth goes round the Sun? For my part I do not think my self at all the worse for't. I confess, said I, Madam, I believe a Fair Lady would be much more concern'd for her place at a Ball, than for her rank in the Universe; and the Precedence of two Planets will not make half such a noise in the World, as that of two Ambassadours; however the same inclination which reigns at a Ceremony, governs in a Systeme, and if you love the uppermost place in the one, the Philosopher desires the Centre in the other; he flatters himself that all things were made for him, and insensibly believes a matter of pure speculation to be a point of Interest. This is a Calumny, said she, you have invented against Mankind; why did they receive this Systeme if it was so abasing? I know not, said I, but I am sure Copernicus himself distrusted the success of his Opinion, he was a long time before he would venture to publish it, nor had he done it then without the importunity of his Friends. But do you know what became of him? the very day they brought him the first Proof of his Book, he dy'd; he foresaw he should never be able to clear all the contradictions, and very wisely slipt out of the way. I would be just to all the World, said the Countess; but 'tis hard to fancy we move and yet see we do not change our place; we find our selves in the Morning where we lay down at Night: Perhaps you will tell me the whole Earth moves-Yes certainly, said I, it is the same case as if you fell asleep in a Boat upon the River, when you awake you find your self in the same place, and the same situation in respect of all the parts of the Boat. 'Tis true, she reply'd, but here's a great difference when I awake I find another shoar, and that shows me, my Boat hath chang'd place. But 'tis not the same with the Earth, I find all things as I left 'em. No, no, said I, there is another Shoar too; You know that beyond the circles of the Planets are fix'd Stars, there is our Shoar. I am upon the Earth, and the Earh makes a great circle round the Sun, I look for the centre of the circle and see the Sun there, I then direct my sight beyond the Sun in a right Line, and should certainly discover the fix'd Stars which answer to the Sun, but that the light of the Sun effaceth 'em: But at Night I easily perceive the Stars which corresponded with him in the day, which is exactly the same thing; if the Earth did not change its place in the Circle where it is, I should see the Sun always against the same fix'd Stars, but when the Earth doth change its place, the Sun must answer to other Stars and there again is your Shoar, which is always changing. And seeing the Earth makes her circle in a year, I see the Sun likewise in the space of a year answer successively to the whole Circle of the fix'd Stars, which Circle is call'd the Zodiack: I will draw you the Figure of it, if you please, on the Sand? 'Tis no matter, said she, I can do well enough without it; beside, it will give an Air of Learning to my Park which I would not have in it: For I have heard of a certain Philosopher, who being Shipwrack'd, and cast upon an unknown Island, seeing several Mathematical Figures trac'd on the Sea-shore, cry'd out to those that follow'd him, Courage, Courage, my Companions, the Isle is inhabited, behold the Footsteps of Men; But you may spare your Figures, such Footsteps are not decent here.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P006: I am glad, said the Lady, I have learnt the Genealogie of the Sciences, and am convinc'd I must stick to Astronomy, my Soul is not mercenary enough for Geometry, nor is it tender enough for Poetry; but I have as much time to spare as Astronomy requires, beside, we are now in the Countrey, and lead a kind of Pastoral life, all which suits best with Astronomy.

Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le Cercle que nous décrivons nous-mesmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur nostre teste, comment se fait-il?

Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le costé où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse. Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planetes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur nostre teste en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la mesme cause. Les Planetes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nostre.

Tell not me, said she, of Lovers and Adorers, I am for my beloved Sun and Planets. But how comes it to pass that the Sun as to the fixed Stars compleats his course but in a year, and yet goes over our Heads every day? Did you never, I reply'd, observe a Bowl on a Bowling-green? It runs towards the Block, and at the same time turns very often round it self, so that the Parts which were above are below, and those which were below are above; just so it is with the Earth, at the same time that she advanceth on the Circle which in a years space she makes round the Sun, in twenty four hours she turns round her self; so that in twenty four hours every part of the Earth loseth the Sun, and recovers him again, and as it turns towards the Sun, it seems to rise, and as it turns from him, it seems to fall. It is very pleasant, said she, that the Earth must take all upon her self, and the Sun do nothing. And when the Moon, the other Planets, and the fix'd Stars seem to go over our Heads every twenty four hours, you'll say that too is only Fancy? Pure Fancy, said I, which proceeds from the same cause, for the Planets compleat their courses round the Sun at unequal times, according to their unequal distances, and that which we see to day answer to a certain Point in the Zodiack or Circle of the fix'd Stars, to morrow we see answer to another Point, because it is advanced on its own Circle as well as we are advanced upon ours. We move, and the Planets move too, which must make a great alteration; so that what seems irregular in the Planets, proceeds only from our motion, when in truth they are all very regular: I will suppose 'em so, said the Countess, but I would not have their Regularity put the Earth to so great trouble; methinks you exact too much Activity from so ponderous a Mass. But, said I, had you rather that the Sun and all the Stars, which are vast great Bodies, should in twenty four hours travel such an infinity of Miles, and make so prodigious a Tour as they needs must, if the Earth did not turn round it self every twenty four hours?

You may as well fancy a little block of Wood can withstand the current of a River. But pray, said she, how can the Earth with all its weight be born up by your Celestial Matter, which must be very light, because it is so fluid? It doth not argue, said I, that what is most fluid is most light: for what think you of the great Vessel I mention'd but now, which with all its Burthen is yet lighter than the Water it floats on? I will have nothing to do with that great Vessel, said she, and I begin to apprehend my self in some danger on such a whirlegigg as you have made of the Earth: There is no danger, I reply'd; but Madam, if you are afraid, we will have the Earth supported by four Elephants, as the Indians believe it. Hey day, cry'd she, here's another Systeme; however I love those People for taking care of themselves, they have a good Foundation to trust to, while you Copernicans are a little too venturous with the Celestial Matter; and yet I fancy if the Indians thought the Earth in the least danger of sinking, they would double their number of Elephants.

I see vast Oceans, and there most horrible Desarts; in short, I discover the infinite variety which is upon the surface of the Earth.

The English translation makes these cultural/geographical analogies explicit by saying: 'The Moon is our Greenwich, and every one of us as meer Cockneys as he that never was out of the sound of Bow-Bell.' Here, the translator not only changes the cities but also explicitly references 'the sound of Bow-Bell,' making explicit a criterion for being called a 'Cockney,' which was only implicit (cultural/geographical knowledge) in the French.","The French says, 'Il faudrait estre simplement Spectateur du Monde, & non pas Habitant' ('one should be simply a Spectator of the World, and not an Inhabitant'). The English version makes it explicit: 'to be purely a Spectator of this World, and not an Inhabitant,' adding the adverb 'purely,' which underscores and clarifies the ideal of objectivity in a way the original only implies.","The French: 'il faut que la Terre renvoye aussi à la Lune la lumiere du Soleil; il n'y a pas plus loin de la Terre à la Lune, que de la Lune à la Terre.' The English makes explicit that 'the Earth in the same manner receives Light from the Sun, and sends it to the Moon; for the Distance is the same between the Earth and the Moon, as between the Moon and the Earth.' The clearer explanation of the reciprocal illumination and the repeated focus on the equality of the distances expands the scientific reasoning that is only implicit in the French.","In the French, Fontenelle suggests that the trembling of the Moon may make us imagine that we have in the sky something like the motion of a pendulum which swings back and forth. The English translation spells it out: 'but then upon my word, she attributes that trembling to us, and fancies that we have in the Heavens the motion of a Pendulum, which vibrates to and fro.'

Comme Astolphe n'estoit pas grand Philosophe, il fut fort surpris de voir la Lune beaucoup plus grande qu'elle ne luy avoit paru de dessus la Terre. Il fut bien plus surpris encore de voir d'autres Fleuves, d'autres Lacs, d'autres Montagnes, d'autres Villes, d'autres Forests, &amp; ce qui m'auroit bien surpris aussi, des Nymphes qui chassoient dans ces Forests. Mais ce qu'il vit de plus rare dans la Lune, c'estoit un Vallon où se trouvoit tout ce qui se perdoit sur la Terre, de quelque espece qu'il fust, &amp; les Couronnes, &amp; les Richesses, &amp; la Renommée, &amp; une infinité d'Esperances, &amp; le temps qu'on donne au Jeu, &amp; les Aumônes qu'on fait faire aprés sa mort, &amp; les Vers qu'on presente aux Princes, &amp; les Soûpirs des Amans. </p><p>P035: Pour les Soûpirs des Amans, interrompit la Marquise, je ne sçais pas si du temps de l'Arioste ils étoient perdus, mais en ce temps-cy je n'en connois point qui aillent dans la Lune. N'y eust-il que vous, Madame, repris-je en badinant, vous y avez fait aller tous ceux qu'on vous a adressez, &amp; c'est dequoy faire dans la Lune un amas considerable. Enfin la Lune est si exacte à recueillir ce qui se perd ici-bas, que tout y est. Mais l'Arioste ne vous dit cela qu'à l'oreille, tout y est jusqu'à la Donation de Constantin. C'est que les Papes ont prétendu estre Maistres de Rome &amp; de l'Italie en vertu d'une Donation que l'Empereur Constantin leur en avoit faite, &amp; la verité est qu'on ne sçauroit dire ce qu'elle est devenuë. Mais devinez de quelle sorte de chose on ne trouve point dans la Lune. De la Folie. Tout ce qu'il y en a jamais eu sur la Terre, s'y est tres-bien conservé. En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus. Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, &amp; qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, &amp; sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met toutes en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus tres-sages, estoient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantost Philosophiques, tantost Poëtiques, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientost aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune.

Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allast pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les airs jusque dans la Lune, mon esprit ne loge pas si haut, il va errant sur vos yeux, sur vostre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en resaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres.</span></span> Cela n'est-il pas joly? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdist jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sçachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le ratrape pas quand on veut.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-estre icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne.</span></span> Mais pour achever de m'oster le mien, dites-moy, &amp; dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune, car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une maniere assez positive.

You must ask that of Astolfo, who was carried into the Moon by St. John.

Astolfo, who had a great mind to see Countrys, did not stand much upon entreaty, and immediately there came a fiery Chariot which carry'd the Apostle and the Knight up into the Air; Astolfo being no great Philosopher, was surpriz'd to find the Moon so much bigger than it appear'd to him when he was upon the Earth; to see Rivers, Seas, Mountains, Cities, Forrests, nay, what would have surpriz'd me too, Nymphs hunting in those Forrests; but that which was most remarkable, was a Valley where you might find any thing that was lost in our World, of what nature soever; Crowns, Riches, Fame, and an infinity of Hopes, the time we spend in Play, and in searching for the Philosophers Stone, the Alms we give after our Death, the Verses we present to great Men and Princes, and the Sighs of Lovers.

Folly, all that ever was upon the Earth is kept there still, but in lieu of it, it is not to be imagin'd how many Wits (if I may so call 'em) that are lost here, are got up into the Moon, they are so many Vials full of a very subtile Liquor, which evaporates immediately if it be not well stopp'd; and upon every one of these Vials the Names are written to whom the Wits belong; I think Ariosto hath heap'd 'em upon one another a little confusedly, but for order sake we will fancy 'em plac'd upon Shelves in a long Gallery; Astolfo wonder'd to see several Vials full inscribed with the Names of the most considerable Statsemen, Divines, Lawyers, &amp;c.

This helps readers who may not immediately imagine a fantastical conveyance.","The translator explicitly remarks that a 'Poetical License ... must be allowed', spelling out the literary justification and softening Ariosto's irreverence toward St. John, which is less directly stated in the French.","The translation not only mentions the dedication to a Cardinal and papal approbation, but also explicitly introduces the storyline ('this is the Argument, Rowland ... mad because ...') making clear the narrative context, whereas the French simply says 'voicy de quoy il s'agit.'","The translator renders 'son Hippogrife' (his hippogriff) as 'his flying Horse', making explicit the mythical creature for readers who may not know the word 'hippogriff.' This clarifies the kind of creature involved.","The English adds explanatory context 'like so much Queen of Hungary's Water' and restructures to clarify that snuffing the vial is an act similar to inhaling a perfume—a detail that might be overlooked by an English audience without this parallel.","In the English, 'he was cursedly plagu'd to carry it, for Hero's wits are naturally very heavy, and there did not want one drop of it' makes explicit that the trouble comes from the 'wits' being heavy, and there being not a drop missing, which is slightly more explanatory than the French's 'assez pesant' and 'il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goute.'","The French description of Ariosto's apostrophe to his mistress is replaced in the English by a full original translation of the poetic apostrophe. The English version greatly expands the implicit meaning with a direct invocation and extended metaphor about recovering his wit from his mistress's features, clarifying that his wit is 'in that sweet Face of yours, in that fair Hair, That ruby Lip, in those two starlike eyn, There is my wit, I know it wanders there.' The French only alludes to 'je ne croy ... que mon esprit ... va errant sur vos yeux, sur vostre bouche, ... je le recueille avec mes lèvres.' The English spells out this search in much more detail, making explicit the poetic imagery.","The translator adds the reasoning: 'the safest way of losing our wits, is to be in love; for you see they do not go far from us, we may recover 'em again at our Lips'—expanding the French, which says simply 'je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdist jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, & qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sçachent le recouvrer.' The English version spells out the safe recoverability of love-lost wits as compared to those lost in philosophy.","In the English, 'our Vials have an honourable Station among the Philosophers, when 'tis forty to one, but Love fixeth our Wits on an Object we cannot but be asham'd of' spells out the opposition between a philosopher's honorable wit and the potentially embarrassing situation of losing one's wits for love—whereas the French only briefly imagines the alternative of spirits erring on someone unworthy. The translator makes the contrast explicit."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience?

Si je vous répondois serieusement, repliquay-je, qu'on ne sçait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moy, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois. J'ay une pensée tres-ridicule, qui a un air de vraysemblance qui me surprend, je ne sçay où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'estat où estoit l'Amerique avant qu'elle eust esté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires.</span></span> Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien.</span></span> Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient.</span></span> Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eust dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas?</span></span> Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Ameriquains plus propres à estre traversées? En verité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous estes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation.</span></span> De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter?</span></span> Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siecles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mestier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont esté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune sçavent peut-estre déja faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sçait quelle surprise. Vous estes insuportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celuy-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sçay bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu.</span></span> Les Anciens se tenoient bien seurs que la Zone Torride, &amp; les Zones Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur, &amp; du temps des Romains la Carte generale de la Terre n'estoit guere plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">Vous m'entendez-bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens.</span></span> Le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous, on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu nostre habitation, il nous sera permis de connoistre celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader.

Elle entre si naturellement dans l'esprit, qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois.</span></span> Ah! vous me soulagez, repliqua la Marquise, vostre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P028: Oh, said she, for the Earth, I reckon it all as good as discover'd, and can guess at the People, tho' I never heard a word of 'em; for certainly they all resemble us very much, and we may know 'em better when we have a mind to't; they will stay where they are, and 'tis no more but going to see 'em; but we cannot get into the Moon if we would, so that I despair of knowing what they do there. You would laugh at me, said I, if I should answer you seriously, perhaps I may deserve it, and yet, I fancy, I can say a great deal to justifie a ridiculous thought that is just now come into my Head; nay to use the Fools best Argument, I'll lay a wager I make you own (in spite of Reason) that one of these days there may be a Communication between the Earth and the Moon, and who knows what great Advantages we may procure by it? Do but consider America before it was discover'd by Columbus, how profoundly ignorant were those People, they knew nothing at all of Arts or Sciences, they went naked, had no other Arms but a Bow and Arrows, and did not conceive they might be carry'd by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a wide Space, forbidden to Man, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing: 'Tis true, after having spent whole years in making hollow the trunks of great Trees with sharp stones, they put themselves to Sea in these Trunks, and floated from Land to Land, as the Wind and Waves drove 'em; but how often was their Trough overset, and they forc'd to recover it again by swimming? So that (except when they were on the Land) it might be said they were continually swimming: And yet had any one but told 'em of another kind of Navigation incomparably more perfect and useful than their own, that they might easily pass over that infinite Space of Water, that they might stop in the middle of the Waves, and in some sense command the Winds, and make their Vessel go fast or slow as they pleas'd; in short, that this impassable Ocean should be no obstacle to their conversing with another different People; do you think they would have believed you? and yet at last that day is come; the unheard of and most surprizing Sight appears, vast great Bodies, with white Wings, are seen to fly upon the Sea, to vomit Fire from all Parts, and to cast on their Shoars an unknown People, all scaled with Iron, who dispose and govern Monsters as they please; carry Thunder in their Hands, and overthrow and destroy whoever resists 'em: From whence came they? Who brought 'em over the Sea? Who gave to 'em the Disposal of the Fire of Heaven? Are they Gods? Are they Sons of the Sun? for certainly they are not Men. Do but consider, Madam, the surprize of the Americans, there can be nothing greater; and after this, shall any one say there shall never be a Communication between the Moon and the Earth. Did the Americans believe there would ever be any between them and Europe, till it came to pass? 'Tis true, you must pass this great Space of Air and Heaven which is between the Earth and the Moon; but did not those vast Seas seem at first as impassable to the Americans? You rave, I think, said she, did you not own the Americans were so ignorant, that they had not the least conception of crossing the Sea; but we who know a great deal more then they, can imagine and fancy the going through the Air, tho' we are assur'd it is not to be done. There is somewhat more than Fancy, I reply'd, when it hath been already practis'd, for several have found the secret of fastning Wings, which bear them up in the Air, to move them as they please, and to fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple; I cannot say indeed they have yet made an Eagles Flight, or that it doth not cost now and then a Leg or an Arm to one of these new Birds; but this may serve to represent the first Planks that were launch'd on the Water, and which were the very beginning of Navigation; there were no Vessels then thought of to sail round the World, and yet you see what great Ships are grown by little and little from those first Planks. The Art of Flying is but newly invented, it will improve by degrees, and in time grow perfect; then we may fly as far as the Moon. We do not yet pretend to have discover'd all things, or that what we have discover'd can receive no addition; and therefore, pray let us agree, there are yet many things to be done in the Ages to come. Were you to live a thousand Ages, said the Countess, I can never believe you will fly, but you must endanger your Neck. I will not, I reply'd, be so unmannerly as to contradict a fair Lady, but tho' we cannot learn the Art here, I hope you will allow they may fly better in the Moon; 'tis no great matter whether we go to them, or they come to us, we shall then be the Americans, who knew nothing of Navigation, and yet there were very good Ships at t' other end of the World. Were it so, said she, the People in the Moon would have been here before now. All in good time, said I, the Europians were not in America till at the end of some thousands of years, they were so long in improving Navigation to the point of crossing the Ocean. The People in the Moon have already made some short Voyages in the Air; they are exercising continually, and by degrees will be more expert, then we shall see 'em, and God knows how we shall be surpriz'd. It is unsufferable, said she, you should banter me at this rate, and justifie your ridiculous Fancy by such false reasoning. I am going to demonstrate, said I, you reproach me very unjustly: Consider, Madam, that the World is unfolded by degrees; for the Ancients were very positive, that the Torrid and Frigid Zones were not inhabitable, by reason of their excessive Heat and Cold; and in the time of the Romans, the general Map of the World was but very little extended beyond that of their Empire; which tho' in one sense, express'd much Grandeur, in another sense, was a sign of as great Ignorance; however, there were Men found both in very hot and in very cold Countreys; so that you see the World is already encreas'd after that it was thought that the Ocean cover'd the whole Earth, except what was then discover'd; there was no talk then of the Antipodes, not so much as a thought of 'em, for who could fancy their Heels at top, and their Heads at bottom; and yet after all their fine reasoning, the Antipodes were discover'd; here's now another half of the World starts up, and a new Reformation of the Map; methinks this, Madam, should restrain us, and teach us not to be so positive in our Opinions, the World will unfold it self more to us hereafter; then we shall know the People in the Moon as well as we do now the Antipodes; but all things must be done in order, the whole Earth must be first discover'd, and till we are perfectly acquainted with our own Habitation, we shall never know that of our Neighbours. Without fooling, said the Countess, you are so very profoud in this Point, that I begin to think, you are in earnest, and believe what you say. Not so neither, said I, but I would shew you how easie it is to maintain a chymerical Notion, that may (like some opinions in Religion,) perplex a Man of understanding, but never perswade him; there is nothing perswades but Truth, it hath no need of all its proofs, but enters naturally into our Understanding; and when once we have learn'd it, we do nothing but think of it. I think you then, said she, for imposing on me no longer; for I confess your false reasoning disturb'd me, but now I sha�l sleep very quietly, if you think fit to go home.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P028: Oh, said she, for the Earth, I reckon it all as good as discover'd, and can guess at the People, tho' I never heard a word of 'em; for certainly they all resemble us very much, and we may know 'em better when we have a mind to't; they will stay where they are, and 'tis no more but going to see 'em; but we cannot get into the Moon if we would, so that I despair of knowing what they do there.

I am going to demonstrate, said I, you reproach me very unjustly: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">Consider, Madam, that the World is unfolded by degrees;</span></span> for the Ancients were very positive, that the Torrid and Frigid Zones were not inhabitable, by reason of their excessive Heat and Cold; and in the time of the Romans, the general Map of the World was but very little extended beyond that of their Empire; which tho' in one sense, express'd much Grandeur, in another sense, was a sign of as great Ignorance; however, there were Men found both in very hot and in very cold Countreys; so that you see the World is already encreas'd after that it was thought that the Ocean cover'd the whole Earth, except what was then discover'd; there was no talk then of the Antipodes, not so much as a thought of 'em, for who could fancy their Heels at top, and their Heads at bottom; and yet after all their fine reasoning, the Antipodes were discover'd; here's now another half of the World starts up, and a new Reformation of the Map; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">methinks this, Madam, should restrain us, and teach us not to be so positive in our Opinions, the World will unfold it self more to us hereafter; then we shall know the People in the Moon as well as we do now the Antipodes; but all things must be done in order, the whole Earth must be first discover'd, and till we are perfectly acquainted with our own Habitation, we shall never know that of our Neighbours.</span></span> Without fooling, said the Countess, you are so very profoud in this Point, that I begin to think, you are in earnest, and believe what you say. Not so neither, said I, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">but I would shew you how easie it is to maintain a chymerical Notion, that may (like some opinions in Religion,) perplex a Man of understanding, but never perswade him; there is nothing perswades but Truth, it hath no need of all its proofs, but enters naturally into our Understanding; and when once we have learn'd it, we do nothing but think of it.</span></span> I think you then, said she, for imposing on me no longer; for I confess your false reasoning disturb'd me, but now I sha�l sleep very quietly, if you think fit to go home.</p>","explanations":["The English translator adds 'and who knows what great Advantages we may procure by it?' which is absent from the source. This explicitates the idea that communication between Earth and the Moon is not simply a matter of possibility, but could bring 'great advantages'—a benefit only implicit in the French.","The source simply says 'Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, & les plus necessaires.' The translation makes explicit examples of their ignorance: 'they went naked, had no other Arms but a Bow and Arrows, and did not conceive they might be carry'd by Animals,' which are additions spelling out what was only implied in the original, namely the specifics of what 'les Arts les plus simples, & les plus necessaires' were.","The English clarifies that the Sea was viewed as 'forbidden to Man,' which is a direct interpretative expansion of 'un grand espace défendu aux hommes' (a great space forbidden to men), making the prohibition explicit.","The English adds 'but how often was their Trough overset, and they forc'd to recover it again by swimming? So that (except when they were on the Land) it might be said they were continually swimming:' whereas the source only says 'il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, & à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient.' The translation explains with more explicit, step-by-step detail, clarifying the implied continual swimming.","In the English, 'there were no Vessels then thought of to sail round the World, and yet you see what great Ships are grown by little and little from those first Planks' is an explicitation not found in the original clause 'qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation.' The progression from primitive beginnings to complex ships is spelled out explicitly.","The English translation renders the rhetorical question not just as 'Did the Americans believe there would be commerce between America and Europe, which they didn't even know?', but as 'Did the Americans believe there would ever be any between them and Europe, till it came to pass?', making explicit the circumstance that the event only became believable after it happened.","The English 'We do not yet pretend to have discover'd all things, or that what we have discover'd can receive no addition; and therefore, pray let us agree, there are yet many things to be done in the Ages to come,' is an explicit expansion of 'Prétendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter?'—clarifying and restating explicitly, with additional commentary on future progress.","The English makes the unfolding of the world explicit: 'Consider, Madam, that the World is unfolded by degrees;' whereas the French glosses quickly over the notion.","The English translator expands on the lesson about the Antipodes, explicitly saying 'methinks this, Madam, should restrain us, and teach us not to be so positive in our Opinions, the World will unfold it self more to us hereafter; then we shall know the People in the Moon as well as we do now the Antipodes; but all things must be done in order, the whole Earth must be first discover'd, and till we are perfectly acquainted with our own Habitation, we shall never know that of our Neighbours.' The French is more elliptical: 'ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens.'","The English translation adds: 'that may (like some opinions in Religion,) perplex a Man of understanding, but never perswade him;' which finds no counterpart in the French. This addition makes explicit a comparison to religious notions that can confuse but not persuade—a notion only implicit or suggested in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P029: The Third Evening.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P029: The Third Evening.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P039: La Marquise voulut mégager pendant le jour à poursuivre nos Entretiens, mais je luy representay que nous ne devions confier nos chimeres qu'à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles, puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet.

Je ne soufriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'huy ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espece que l'on croit, &amp; en reserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse estre admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paye point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint Denis ressemble à Paris. Le Soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost un Païs, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mesmes changemens sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voila le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'éleve point de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que nostre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement ou il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoy, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-estre que de grandes cavitez. De la distance ou nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, repliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la verité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantost une partie, tantost une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes. Mais ces mesmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mesmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour estre imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mesmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-mesme, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors</span></span>.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées.

Sur ce pied-là, il faudra que la matiere étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voila ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.

I cannot suffer it, said she; yesterday you were preparing me to receive a Visit from 'em, and now there are no such People in Nature: Once you would have me believe the Moon was inhabited; I surmounted the Difficulty I had, and will now believe it. You are a little too nimble, I reply'd; did I not advise you never to be entirely convinc'd in things of this nature, but to reserve half of your understanding free and disengag'd, that you may admit of the contrary opinion, if there be any occasion. I care not for your Sentences, said she, let us come to matter of Fact. Are we not to consider the Moon as Greenwhich? No, said I, the Moon doth not so much resemble the Earth, as Greenwich doth London: The Sun draws from the Earth and Water, Exhalations and Vapours, which mounting to a certain height in the Air, do there assemble, and form the Clouds; these uncertain Clouds are driven irregularly round the Globe, sometimes shadowing one Countrey, and sometimes another; he then who beholds the Earth from a-far off, will see frequent alterations upon its surface, because a great Country overcast with Clouds, will appear dark or light, as the Clouds stay, or pass over it; he will see the Spots on the Earth often change their Place, and appear, or disappear as the Clouds remove; but we see none of these changes wrought upon the Moon, which would certainly be the same, were there but Clouds about her; but on the contrary, all her Spots are fix'd and certain, and her light parts continue where they were at first, which truly is a great misfortune; for by this reason, the Sun draws no Exhalations or Vapours above the Moon; so that it appears she is a Body infinitely more hard, and solid than the Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upwards as soon as Heat puts them in Motion: But it must be a heap of Rock and Marble, where there is no Evaporation; besides, Exhalations are so natural and necessary where there is Water, that there can be no Water at all, where there is no Exhalation; and what sort of Inhabitants must those be, whose Countrey affords no Water, is all Rock, and produceth nothing? Very fine, said she, you have forgot since, you assur'd me, we might from hence distinguish Seas in the Moon; nay, You or your Friends were Godfathers to some of 'em. Pray, what is become of your Caspian Sea, and your Black Lake? All Conjecture, Madam, I reply'd, tho' for your Ladyships sake, I am very sorry for it; for those dark places we took to be Seas, may perhaps be nothing but large Cavities; 'tis hard to guess aright at so great a distance. But will this suffice then, said she, to extirpate the People in the Moon? Not altogether, I reply'd, we will neither determine for, nor against them. I must own my weakness (if it be one) said she, I cannot be so perfectly undetermin'd as you would have me to be, but must believe one way, or the other; therefore pray fix me quickly in my opinion; as to the Inhabitants of the Moon; preserve or annihilate them, as you shall think fit; and yet methinks I have a strange inclination for 'em, and would not have 'em destroy'd, if it were possible to save 'em. You know, Madam, said I, I can deny you nothing; the Moon shall be no longer a Defart, but to do you service, we will repeople her. Since to all appearance, the Spots in the Moon do not change, I cannot conceive there are any Clouds about her, that sometimes obscure one part, and sometimes another; yet this doth not hinder, but that the Moon sends forth Exhalations, and Vapours. Our Clouds which we see in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their coming out of the Earth, were separated into such minute Particles, that they could not be discern'd; but as they ascend higher, they are condens'd by the Cold, and by the re- union of their Parts, are render'd visible; after which they become great Clouds, which fluctuate in the Air, till they return back again in Rain; however these Exhalations and Vapours do sometimes keep themselves so dispers'd, that they are imperceptible; or if they do assemble, it is in forming such subtile Dews, that they cannot be discern'd to fall from any Cloud. It may likewise happen, that the Vapours which go out of the Moon (for it is incredible that the Moon is such a Mass, that all its Parts are of an equal Solidity, all at rest one with another, and all incapable of any alteration from the efficacy of the Sun; I am sure we are yet unacquainted with such a Body: Marble it self is of another Nature, and even that which is most Solid, is subject to Change and Alteration; either from the secret and invisible motion it hath within it self, or from that which it receives from without) it may so happen then, that the Vapours which issue from the Moon, may not assemble round her in Clouds, and may not fall back again in Rain, but only in Dews. It is sufficient for this, that the Air with which the Moon is environ'd, (for it is certain that the Moon is encompassed with Air as well as the Earth) be a little different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon a little different from those of the Earth, which is very probable. Hereupon the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than on the Earth, the Effects must be different; tho' it is of no great consequence whether they are or no; for from the moment we have found an inward motion in the parts of the Moon, or produced by foreign Causes, here is enough for the new birth of its Inhabitants, and a sufficient and necessary fund for their Subsistence. This will furnish us with Corn, Fruit, Water, according to the custom or manner of the Moon, which I do not pretend to know; and all proportion'd to the wants and use of the Inhabitants, with whom I pretend to be as little acquainted. That is to say, reply'd the Countess, you know all is very well, without knowing how it is so, which is a great deal of Ignorance upon a very little Knowledge; however I comfort my self, that you have given the Moon her Inhabitants again, and have wrap'd her in an Air of her own, without which a Planet would seem but very naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: Well, Madam, said I, I have great News for you; that which I told you last Night, of the Moon's being inhabited, may not be so now: There is a new Fancy got into my Head, which puts those People in great Danger.

Here the translator explicates the metaphor of being gnawed, making explicit a comparison likely intended but unstated in the French.","The English translation intensifies the contrast by using the phrase 'be so very barren in the rest of the Planets', where the French 'sterilité à n'y rien produire de vivant' merely states barrenness. This addition spells out the degree of barrenness explicitly.","In the translation, 'There is no need of Fancy, I reply'd, do but trust your Eyes, and you will easily perceive how Nature diversifies in these several Worlds', the translator omits the limitation of imagination and instead asserts a direct, more explicit instruction to the reader ('trust your Eyes'), clarifying the process of apprehension.","The translator makes explicit the comparison by clarifying, 'All humane Faces, in general, are of the same Model, and yet the Europeans and the Africans have two particular Moulds; nay, commonly every Family have a different Form,' specifying 'Moulds' and 'Form' for groups and families, where the source is more abstract using 'modeles particuliers' and 'modele des visages de chaque Famille'.","Where the French says 'Apparemment les differences augmentent à mesure que l'on s'éloigne...', the English makes explicit that 'the difference too increaseth with the distance' and provides more detail about who is closer to whom ('nearer Neighbours') rather than the general 'plus voisions'.","The translation 'here, for Example, we have the use of Voice, in another World, they speak by Signs, and at a greater distance they do not speak at all;' makes explicit the evolutionary sequence of forms of communication, clarifying 'plus loin on ne parle point du tout' with 'at a greater distance', drawing a clearer progression.","The translator explicates 'plus loin les Vieillards n'en sçavent pas plus que les Enfants' by embedding the structural logic: 'here our Reason is form'd by Experience, in the next World, Experience contributes little towards it; and in the next to that, old Men know no more than Children;', clarifying the implied sequential development.","The English adds clarifying parenthesis 'which by the way, I think, is much the better' after describing people unconcerned with either the future or the past; this is an explicitation of the narrator's opinion which is only implicit in the French.","The phrase 'Here, 'tisthought we want a sixth Sense, which would teach us many things, of which we are now ignorant; this sixth Sense, is apparently in another World, where they want one of the five which we enjoy;' makes explicit that both the want of the sixth sense here and the lack of one of the five senses in another world are reciprocal – a clarification of the relationship, which is only implicit in the French.","The translator clarifies the meaning of 'partage que nous avons fait' (the sharing we have made) as 'in the Partition we have made of 'em with the Inhabitants of the other Planets', and makes fully explicit that there are only five senses allotted to us ('there are but five fall'n to our share'), adding the reason ('for want of being acquainted with the rest').","In 'the rest is reserv'd for other Worlds, where somewhat which we know, is unknown to them', the translator explicates that the remainder of science not known to us is actually 'reserved' for other worlds, making the implied distribution and reciprocity explicit.","The translation's phrase 'in a word, that which Nature practises here in little, in distributing her Gifts among Mankind; she does at large in other Worlds, where she makes use of that admirable secret she hath to diversifie all things, and at the same time makes 'em equal, by compensating for the inequality; this I confess is on the Borders of Nonsense, but a Man is ne'er the less a Philosopher for being a little obscure, if not unintelligible.' spells out ideas of distributing gifts and compensating for inequalities which in French are more allusive, and then adds the explicit self-reflexive comment about being on 'the Borders of Nonsense' and defending philosophical obscurity, which is absent from the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P053: Etes-vous contente, Madame, ajoûtay-je en quittant le ton serieux?

The addition of 'took time to consider' makes explicit an intentional, deliberative act of Nature, rather than merely having needs 'in view.' The phrase 'of all animate Beings' expands 'quelques Estres vivans' (some living beings) to a broader, more encompassing group, clarifying and making explicit the generality.","The source French outlines 'Phosphores, de ces matieres liquides ou seches, qui en recevant la lumiere du Soleil, s'en imbibent, & s'en penetrent, & ensuite jettent un assez grand éclat dans l'obscurité' (Phosphores, these liquid or dry substances, which upon receiving the Sun's light, absorb it, and later emit a fairly strong glow in the dark). The English translation explicates this: 'You have seen the Phosphorus, both liquid and dry, how it receives and imbibes the rays of the Sun, and what a great light it will cast in a dark Place.' The English clarifies that 'Phosphorus' is 'both liquid and dry,' and spells out that it 'casts a great light in a dark Place,' which specifies and expands on the more condensed French phrasing 'assez grand éclat dans l'obscurité.'","Whereas the French says, 'Vous sçavez encore qu'il y a en Amerique des Oyseaux qui sont si lumineux dans les tenebres, qu'on s'en peut servir pour lire.' ('You know also that there are in America Birds so luminous in darkness, that one may use them to read'), the English makes the relationship more explicit: 'there is a kind of Bird in America, that yields such a light, you may read by it in the darkest night.' The translation spells out that 'in the darkest night' is when this is possible, clarifying the circumstance and the utility, and foregrounds the causal relationship between the bird's light and the ability to read, which was implicit in the French."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P079: Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oyseaux.

Ne le seront-elles pas?') as a direct opposition 'are they inhabited... or are they not inhabited?', which spells out the dichotomy that was only implied by the question forms in French.","The source: 'La distance du Soleil à la Planete la plus éloignée, n'est rien par rapport à la distance du Soleil ou de la Terre aux Etoiles Fixes, & on ne prend pas la peine de la compter.' is rendered as: 'The distance from the Sun to the farthest Planet, is nothing in comparison of the distance from the Sun, or from the Earth, to the fix'd Stars, it is almost beyond Arithmetick.' The translation makes more explicit what is only implicit in '& on ne prend pas la peine de la compter.' ('and one does not bother to count it'), by expanding it to 'it is almost beyond Arithmetick.' The English version thus clarifies the reason no one counts it: because it is nearly beyond calculation/arithmetics, whereas the French simply states it is not worth the trouble.","The source says: 'Les voila donc lumineuses par elles-mêmes, & toutes, en un mot, autant de Soleils.' The translation renders this as 'which cannot but proceed from it self; so that in a word, all the fix'd Stars are so many Suns.' The addition 'which cannot but proceed from it self' is an explicitation of 'lumineuses par elles-mêmes' (luminous by themselves), making explicit that the stars' light must come from themselves. Moreover, 'so many Suns' unpacks 'autant de Soleils', making it clear that 'the fix'd Stars are so many Suns', clarifying the strong ontological assertion about the physical nature of the stars which is left more metaphorical in the original."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P087: Ne me trompay-je point, s'écria la Marquise, ou si je vois où vous me voulez mener?

The French source only prompts the reader to picture what the Milky Way is; the English makes explicit the underlying astronomical concept that was only suggested in the original.","The translator clarifies 'Ils ressemblent en quelque sorte aux Isles Maldives, à ces douze mille petites Isles ou Bancs de Sable, separez seulement par des Canaux de Mer, que l'on sauteroit presque comme des Fossez.' by rendering it as 'They are in some sort, like the Maldivian Islands: those twelve thousand banks of Sand, separated by narrow Channels of the Sea, which a Man may leap as easily, as over a Ditch.' The source uses 'Isles or Banks of Sand,' but the target explains 'banks of Sand' alone, making explicit that all twelve thousand are banks of sand, with further specification on their separations.","Where the French says, 'Ainsi les petits Tourbillons de la Voye de Lait sont si serrez, qu'il me semble que d'un Monde à l'autre on pourroit se parler, ou mesme se donner la main.

The explicit statement, 'may talk, and shake Hands with those of another,' expands on the possibility of communication, rather than just talking or even shaking hands, making the connection between proximity and possible physical interaction more explicit.","The translator expands 'Ces petits Mondes sortent apparemment de la regle generale, par laquelle un Soleil dans son Tourbillon efface dés qu'il paroist tous les Soleils étrangers.' to 'These little Worlds are excepted out of that general Rule, by which one Sun in his own Vortex, as soon as he appears, effaceth the light of all other forreign Suns:' The target makes explicit that the Sun 'effaceth the light' of other foreign Suns, clarifying the mechanism which is only succinctly stated in the French.","The sentence 'Si vous estes dans un des petits Tourbillons de la Voye de Lait, vostre Soleil n'est presque pas plus proche de vous, & par consequent n'a pas sensiblement plus de force sur vos yeux, que cent mille autres Soleils des Tourbillons voisins.' is re-written as 'If you were in one of these little Vortex's of the Milky way, your Sun would not be much nearer to you, and consequently, would not make any much greater sensible impression on your Eyes, than a hundred thousand other Suns of the neighbouring Vortex's:' The English makes explicit what the 'force sur vos yeux' means by explaining it as not making 'any much greater sensible impression on your Eyes.'","The translator expands 'Lors que vous perdez de veuë vostre Soleil particulier, il vous en reste encore assez, & vostre nuit n'est pas moins éclairée que le jour, du moins la diference ne peut pas estre sensible, & pour parler plus juste, vous n'avez jamais de nuit.' into 'You would then see your Heaven shine bright with an infinite number of Fires, close to one another, and but a little distant from you; so that tho' you should lose the light of your own particular Sun, yet there would still remain visible Suns enough beside your own, to make your Night as light as Day, at least, the difference would hardly be perceiv'd, for the truth is, you would never have any Night at all:' This makes explicit the process by which night would appear as day, explaining cause and effect more fully than the original.","The translator transforms 'Ils seroient bien étonnez, les Gens de ces Mondes-là, accoûtumez comme ils sont à une clarté perpetuelle, si on leur disoit qu'il y a des malheureux qui ont de veritables nuits, qui tombent dans des tenebres tres-profondes, & qui quand ils joüissent de la lumiere, ne voyent mesme qu'un seul Soleil.' into 'The Inhabitants of these Worlds accustom'd to perpetual Brightness, would be strangely astonish'd, if they should be told that there are a miserable sort of People, who where they live, have very dark Nights, and when 'tis Day with them, they never see more than one Sun; certainly they would think Nature had very little kindness for us, and would tremble with horrour, to think what a sad condition we are in.'

The translator explicates the metaphor by making explicit the analogy to a housewife managing resources efficiently and adds the clarification 'and suffers nothing to be useless', which is implicit in the French but not overtly stated.","The French text implies that the little worlds, though made only to fill useless corners and unknown to their neighbors, are nonetheless content with themselves. The English version explicitly states, 'they are well satisfy'd with their being where they are,' thus making explicit the contentedness which is only subtly implied in the French.","The French compares each world to a balloon that swells by itself, gets pushed back, and then swells again. The translation explicates this metaphor by specifying 'like a Foot-ball, made of a Bladder, cover'd with Leather, which sometimes swells of its own accord, and would extend it self, if it were not hindred. But this swelling World being press'd by the next to it, returns to its first Figure; then swells again, and is again deprest.'

D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démeslez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je croy aisément que tout cela peut estre, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir esté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir esté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différens, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondemens d'un nouveau Monde? J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature.

How? cry'd the Countess, can Suns be put out? Yes, without doubt said I, for People some thousand years ago saw fix'd Stars in the Sky, which are now no more to be seen; these were Suns which have lost their Light, and certainly there must be strange Desolation in their Vortex's, and a general Mortality over all the Planets, for what can People do without a Sun? This is a dismal Fancy, said the Countess, I would not if I could help it, let it come into my head. I will tell you if you please, I reply'd, what in this particular is the Opinion of Learned Astronomers. They think that the fix'd Stars which have disappear'd, are not quite extinguish'd, but that they are half Suns, that is, they have one half Dark, and the other half Light, and turning round upon their own Axis or Centre, they sometimes shew us their Light side, and afterwards turning to us their Dark side, we see them no more. To oblige you Madam, I will be of this Opinion, because it is not so harsh as the other, but I cannot make it good, but in relation to some certain Stars, because as some have lately observed, those Stars have their Regulated times of appearing, and disappearing, otherwise there could be no such thing as half Suns. But what shall we say of Stars, which totally disappear, and never shew themselves again after they have finish'd their Course of turning round upon their own Axis? you are too just Madam to oblige me to believe that such Stars are half Suns. However I will try once more what I can do in favour of your Opinion; the Suns are not extinct, they are only sunk so low into the immense depth of Heaven, that we cannot possibly see them, in this Case the Vortex follows his Sun and all's well again. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fix'd Stars have not this motion, by which they remove themselves so far from us, because at other times they might return again nearer to us, and we should see them sometimes greater, and sometimes less, which never happens. But we will suppose that none but the Little, Light, and most Active Vortex's which slip between the others make certain voyages, after which they return again, while the main body of Vortex's remain unmov'd. 'Tis likewise very strange that some fix'd Stars shew themselves to us, spending a great deal of time in appearing, and disappearing, and at last, totally and entirely disappear. Half Suns would appear again at their set and regulated time. Now Madam, boldly declare your Opinion; Must not these Stars of necessity be Suns which are so much darkned as not to be visible to us, yet afterwards shine again, and at last are wholly extinct? How can a Sun said the Countess, be darkned, and quite extinguish'd, when it is in its own Nature a Fountain of Light? It may be done Madam, said I, with all the ease in the world, if Desc�rtes Opinion be true, that our Sun hath Spots; now whether these Spots be Scum or thick Mists, or what you please, they may thicken and unite, till at last they cover the Sun with a Crust, which daily grows thicker, and then Farewell Sun. We have hitherto scap'd pretty well; but 'tis said, that the Sun for some whole years together hath look'd very pale; for Example, the year after Caesar's death; it was this Crust that then began to grow, but the force of the Sun broke and dissipated it; had it continued, we had been all lost People. You make me tremble, reply'd the Countess; and now I know the fatal consequences of the Sun's paleness, I believe, instead of going every morning to my Glass, to see how I look, I shall cast my Eyes up to Heaven, to see whether or no the Sun looks pale. Oh, Madam, said I, there is a great deal of time required to ruine a World. Grant it, said she, yet 'tis but time that is required. I confess it, said I; all this immense mass of Matter that composes the Universe, is in perpetual motion, no part of it excepted; and since every part is moved, you may be sure that changes must happen sooner or later; but still in times proportioned to the Effect. The Ancients were pleasant Gentlemen, to imagine that the celestial Bodies were in their own nature unchangeable, because they observed no change in them; but they did not live long enough to confirm their opinion by their own experience; they were Boys in comparison of us. Give me leave, Madam, to explain my self by an Allegory: If Roses, which last but a day, could write Histories, and leave Memoirs one to another; and if the first Rose should draw an exact Picture of their Gardiner, and after fifteen thousand Rose-Ages, it should be left to other Roses, and so left still to those that should succeed, without any change in it; should the Roses hereupon say, we have every day seen the same Gardiner, and in the memory of Roses, none ever saw any Gardiner but this; he is still the same he was, and therefore certainly he will never die, as we do; for there is no change at all in him. Would not these Roses, Madam, talk very foolishly? and yet there would be more reason in their discourse, than there was in what the Ancients said concerning celestial Bodies; and tho' even to this very day there should appear no visible change in the Heavens, and the matter of which they are made, should have all the signs of an eternal duration without any change; yet I would not believe 'em unchangeable, till I had the experience of many more Ages. Ought we, who last but a moment, make our continuance the measure of any other things duration; 'tis not so easie a matter to be eternal. To have lasted many Ages of Men, one after another, is no sign of Immortality. Truly, says the Countess, I find the Worlds are far from being able to pretend to it; I will not do 'em so much honour, as to ompare 'em to the Gardiner that lived so much longer than the Roses: I begin to think 'em like the Roses themselves, which blow one day, and die the next: For now I understand, that if old Stars disappear, new ones will come in their room, because every species must preserve it self. No species, Madam, said I, can totally perish; some perhaps will tell you, that such new Stars are Suns, which return to our sight again, after they have been a long time hid from us, in the profundity of Heaven: Others may tell you, they are Suns cleared from that thick crust, which once covered them: If I should think all this possible, yet I likewise believe that the Universe may be framed in such a manner, that from time to time it may produce new Suns; why may not that matter which is proper to make a Sun, be dispers'd here and there, and gather it self again at long run, into one certain place, and lay the foundation of a new World? I am very much inclin'd to believe such new productions, because they suit with that glorious and admirable Idea which I have of the works of Nature. Can we think that wise Nature knows no more than the secret of making Herbs and Plants live and die by a continual revolution? I am verily perswaded, and are not you so too, Madam? that Nature, without much cost or pains can put the same secret in practice, upon the Worlds. I now find, says the Countess, the Worlds, the Heaven, and celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am come to my self again. To come the better again to our selves, I reply'd, let us say no more of these Matters. We are arrived at the very roof and top of all the Heavens; and to tell you whether there be any Stars beyond it, you must have an abler Man than I am; you may place Worlds there, or no Worlds, as you please: 'Tis the Philosopher's Empire to describe those vast invisible Countries, which are, and are not, or are such as he pleases to make 'em: It is enough for me, to have carried your mind as far as you can see with your Eyes.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P083: You have no reason then, said I, to pity the Inhabitants of a Comet, yet I suppose you will think their Condition lamentable, who inhabit a Vortex whose Sun comes in time to be quite extinguished, and consequently live in Eternal Night.
