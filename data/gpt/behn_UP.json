Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les Heroïnes de Romans, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je.

Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir.</span></span><span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\"> J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée. Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle? Helas, repliquay-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire. C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">Et bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la-moy, je croiray sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">Non, repliquay-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day? I confess, said she, the Day must yield to such a Night; the day which resembles a fair Beauty, which though more sparkling, is not so charming as one of a brown Complexion, who is a true Emblem of the Night. You are very generous, Madam, said I, to give the advantage to the brown, you who are so admirably fair your self: Yet without dispute, day is the most beautiful thing in Nature; and most of the Heroines in Romances, which are modelled after the most perfect Idea fancy can represent by the most ingenious of mankind, are generally described to be fair. But, said she, Beauty is insipid, if it want the pleasure and power of charming; and you must acknowledge that the brightest day that ever you saw could never have engaged you in so agreeable an Ecstasie, as you were just now like to have faln into by the powerful attractions of this Night.</p> <p>P004: I agree to what you say, Madam, said I, but I must own at the same time, that a Beauty of your complexion would give me another sort of transport than the finest Night with all the advantages obscurity can give it.</p> <p>P005: Though that were true, said she, I should not be satisfied; since those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other. How comes it, that Lovers who are the best Judges of what is pleasing and touching, do always address themselves to the Night, in all their Songs and Elegies? I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that? The silence and gloom of the Night, said I, inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing. Besides, the Scene of the Universe by day-light appears too Uniform, we beholding but one Great Luminary in an Arched Vault of Azure, of a Vast Extent, while all the Stars appear confusedly dispersed, and disposed as it were by chance in a thousand different Figures, which assists our roving Fancies to fall agreeably into silent thoughts. Sir, replied Madam la Marqueise, I have always felt those effects of Night you tell me of, I love the Stars, and could be heartily angry with the Sun for taking them from my sight. Ah, cry'd I, I cannot forgive his taking from me the sight of all those Worlds that are there. Worlds, said she, what Worlds? And looking earnestly upon me, asked me again, what I meant? I ask your Pardon, Madam, said I, I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness. What weakness, said she, more earnestly than before? Alass, said I, I am sorry that I must confess I have imagined to my self, that every Star may perchance be another World, yet I would not swear that it is so; but I will believe it to be true, because that Opinion is so pleasant to me, and gives me very diverting Idea's, which have fixed themselves delightfully in my Imaginations, and 'tis necessary that even solid Truth should have it's agreeableness. Well, said she, since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it; I will believe whatever you please concerning the Stars, if I find it pleasant. Ah, Madam, said I, hastily, it is not such a Pleasure as you find in one of Mullier's Plays; it is a Pleasure that is-I know not where, in our Reason, and which only transports the Mind. What, replied she, do you think me then incapable of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind? I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars. Ah, Madam, cry'd I, I shall never indure to be reproach'd with that neglect of my own happiness, that in a Grove at ten a Clock of the Night, I talk'd of nothing but Philosophy, to the greatest Beauty in the World; no, Madam, search for Philosophy some where else.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: WE went one Evening after Supper to walk in the Park, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">the Air was cool and refreshing, which made us sufficient amends for the excessive heat of the Day, and of which I find I shall be obliged to make you a Description, which I cannot well avoid, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">the fineness of it leading me so necessarily to it.</span></span></span></span> </p><p>P003: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">The Moon was about an hour high, which shining through the Boughs of the Trees, made a most agreeable Mixture, and checker'd the Paths beneath with a most resplendent white upon the green, which appeared to be black by that Light;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">there was no Cloud to be seen that could hide from us, or obscure the smallest of the Stars, which lookt all like pure polisht Gold, whose Luster was extreamly heightened by the deep Azure Field on which they were placed:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">These pleasant Objects set me a thinking, and had it not been for Madam la Marquiese, I might have continued longer in that silent Contemplation; but the Presence of a Person of her Wit and Beauty hindered me from giving up my Thoughts intirely to the Moon and Stars.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Do not you believe, Madam, said I, that the clearness of this Night exceeds the Glory of the brightest day?

This rephrasing and expansion gives more specificity ('another sort of transport') and underscores the comparison of beauty to night.","The target text adds explanation with 'those fair Beauties that so resemble the day, produce not those soft Effects of the other' and more direct language about lovers' preferences, rationalizing the metaphor for clarity.","'I told her, that they most certainly paid their acknowledgments to the Night; for she was ever most favourable to all their Designs. But, Sir, replied the Marquise, she receives also all their Complaints, as a true Confident of all their Entrigues; from whence proceeds that?' introduces 'as a true Confident of all their Entrigues,' which is not in the original, to provide additional context about night being a confidant.","In this segment, clauses such as 'inspires the restless Sigher with thoughts very passionate and languishing, which the busier day diverts a thousand little ways (though one would think the Night should charm all things to repose) and though the day affords Solitudes, dark Recesses, Groves and Grottoes, equally obscure and silent as the Night it self; yet we fansy that the Stars move with a more silent motion than the Sun, and that all the Objects which the Heavens represent to our view, are softer, and stay our sight more easily; and flattering our selves that we are the only Persons at that time awake, we are vain enough to give a loose to a thousand thoughts extravagant and easing.

These are interpretive additions giving a directness to the Marquise’s feelings that is more explicit than the original.","The translation adds 'Ah, cry'd I, I cannot forgive his taking from me the sight of all those Worlds that are there. Worlds, said she, what Worlds? And looking earnestly upon me, asked me again, what I meant? I ask your Pardon, Madam, said I, I was insensibly led to this fond discovery of my weakness. What weakness, said she, more earnestly than before?

The elaboration around the Marquise's questioning and the narrator’s internal justification is more thorough and psychologically detailed than in the French.","In 'Well, said she, since your Folly is so pleasing to you, give me a share of it; I will believe whatever you please concerning the Stars, if I find it pleasant,' the structure is reshaped and extra conditional language is supplied to clarify consent for the target audience.","The English adds 'it is not such a Pleasure as you find in one of Mullier's Plays; it is a Pleasure that is-I know not where, in our Reason, and which only transports the Mind.' The reference to 'Mullier's Plays' (for Molière) is an adaptation for the English target audience, and the expansion on the 'pleasure which only transports the Mind' explains the concept for clarity.","The translator adds 'What, replied she, do you think me then incapable of all those Pleasures which entertain our Reason, and only treat the Mind? I will instantly shew you the contrary, at least as soon as you have told me what you know of your Stars.'

Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne, &amp; nous y menons quasi une vie pastorale; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie.</span></span> Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Ce n'est pas la vraye vie pastorale que de parler des Planetes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps.</span></span> Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaist, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usage</span></span>s, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes.</span></span> La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">je vous declare que je m'en contente.</span></span> Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres, par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries.</span></span> L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis. La pensée est trop libertine, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien.</span></span> Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit.</span></span> Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres.</span></span> Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là.</span></span> Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je.</span></span> Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoyent esté imaginez par l'Antiquité. Il détruit les uns, il met les autres en pieces. Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome, il prend la Terre, &amp; l'envoye bien loin du centre de l'Univers, où elle s'estoit placée, &amp; dans ce centre il y met le Soleil, à qui cet honneur estoit bien mieux dû. Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvemens qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux.</span></span> Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</span></span> </p><p>P008: Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient. Avoüez que si vostre Allemand euft pû nous la faire perdre, il l'auroit fait volontiers, car je voy dans tout son procedé qu'il estoit bien mal intentionné pour la Terre? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">Je luy sçay bon gré, repliquay-je, d'avoir rabatu la vanité des hommes, qui s'estoient mis à la plus belle place de l'Univers, &amp; j'ay du plaisir à voir presentement la Terre dans la foule des Planetes.</span></span> Bon, répondit-elle, croyez-vous que la vanité des hommes s'étende jusqu'à l'Astronomie? Croyez-vous m'avoir humiliée pour m'avoir appris que la Terre tourne autour du Soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">Mon Dieu, Madame, repris-je, je sçay bien qu'on sera moins jaloux du rang qu'on tient dans l'Univers, que de celuy qu'on croit devoir tenir dans une chambre, &amp; que la préseance de deux Planetes ne sera jamais une si grande affaire, que celle de deux Ambassadeurs.</span></span> Cependant la mesme inclination qui fait qu'on veut avoir la place la plus honorable dans une Ceremonie, fait qu'un Philosophe dans un Sistême se met au centre du Monde, s'il peut. Il est bien aise que tout soit fait pour luy; il suppose peut-estre sans s'en appercevoir, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"22\">ce principe qui le flate, &amp; son coeur ne laisse pas de s'interesser à une affaire de pure speculation.</span></span> Franchement, repliqua-t-elle, c'est-là une calomnie que vous avez inventée contre le Genre humain. On n'auroit donc jamais dû recevoir le Sistême de Copernic, puis qu'il est si humiliant. Aussi, repris-je, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"23\">Copernic luy-mesme se défioit-il fort du succés de son opinion. Il fut tres-long-temps à ne la vouloir pas publier. Enfin il s'y résolut à la priere de Gens tres-considerables. Mais aussi le jour qu'on luy apporta le premier Exemplaire imprimé de son Livre, sçavez-vous ce qu'il fit? Il mourut. Il ne voulut point essuyer toutes les contradictions qu'il prévoyoit, &amp; se tira habilement d'affaire.</span></span> Ecoutez, dit la Marquise, il faut rendre justice à tout le monde. Il est seur qu'on a de la peine à s'imaginer qu'on tourne, car enfin on ne change point de place, &amp; on se retrouve toûjours le matin où l'on s'estoit couché le soir. Je voy, ce me semble, à vostre air, que vous m'allez dire, que comme la Terre toute entiere marche... Assurément, interrompis-je, c'est la mesme chose que si vous vous endormiez dans un Bateau qui allast sur la Riviere, vous vous retrouveriez à vostre réveil dans la mesme place, &amp; dans la mesme situation à l'égard de toutes les parties du Bateau. Oüi, mais, repliqua-t-elle, voicy une difference, je trouverois à mon réveil le rivage changé, &amp; cela me feroit bien voir que mon Bateau auroit changé de place. Mais il n'en va pas de mesme de la Terre, j'y retrouve toutes choses comme je les avois laissées. Non pas, Madame, répondis-je, non pas, le rivage est changé aussi. Vous sçavez qu'au-delà de tous les Cercles des Planetes sont les Etoiles fixes, Voila nostre rivage. Je suis sur la Terre, &amp; la Terre décrit un grand Cercle autour du Soleil. Je regarde au centre de ce Cercle, j'y voy le Soleil. S'il n'effaçoit point les Etoiles, en poussant ma veüe en ligne droite au-delà du Soleil, je le verrois necessairement répondre à quelques Etoiles Fixes, mais je vois aisément pendant la nuit à quelles Etoiles il a répondu le jour, &amp; c'est exactement la mesme chose. Si la Terre ne changeoit point de place sur le Cercle où elle est, je verrois toûjours le Soleil répondre aux mesmes Etoiles Fixes; mais dés qu'elle change de place, il faut que je le voye répondre à d'autres. C'est-là le rivage qui change tous les jours; &amp; comme la Terre fait son Cercle en un an, je voy le Soleil en l'espace d'une année répondre successivement à tout un Circle d'Etoiles Fixes. Ce Cercle s'appelle le Zodiaque. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"24\">Voulez-vous que je fasse icy une figure sur le sable? Non, répondit-elle, je m'en passeray bien; &amp; puis cela donneroit à mon Parc un air sçavant, que je ne veux pas qu'il ait.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"25\">N'ay-je pas oüy dire qu'un Philosophe qui fut jetté par un naufrage dans une Isle qu'il ne connaissoit point, s'écria à ceux qui le suivoyent, en voyant de certaines figures de Mathematiques tracées sur le bord de la mer: Courage, Compagnons, l'Isle est habitée, voicy des pas d'hommes. Vous jugez bien qu'il ne m'appartient point de faire ces pas-là, &amp; qu'il ne faut pas qu'on en voye icy.</span></span> </p><p>P009: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"26\">Il vaut mieux en effet, répondis-je, qu'on n'y voye que des pas d'Amans, c'est à dire, vostre nom &amp; vos chiffres gravez sur l'écorce des arbres par la main de vos Adorateurs.</span></span> Laissons-là, je vous prie, les Adorateurs, reprit-elle, &amp; parlons du Soleil. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"27\">J'entends bien comment nous nous imaginons qu'il décrit le Cercle que nous décrivons nous-mesmes, mais ce tour ne s'acheve qu'en un an, &amp; celuy que le Soleil fait tous les jours sur nostre teste, comment se fait-il?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"28\">Avez-vous remarqué, luy répondis-je, qu'une boule qui roule sur la Terre, a deux mouvemens? Elle va vers le but où elle est envoyée, &amp; en mesme temps elle tourne un grand nombre de fois sur elle-mesme, en sorte que les parties d'en haut viennent en bas, &amp; que celles d'en bas montent en haut. La Terre fait la mesme chose. Dans le temps qu'elle avance sur le Cercle qu'elle décrit en un an autour du Soleil, elle tourne sur elle-mesme en vingt-quatre heures. Ainsi en vingt-quatre heures chaque partie de la Terre perd le Soleil, &amp; le recouvre, &amp; à mesure qu'en tourne vers le costé où est le Soleil, il semble qu'il s'élève, &amp; quand on commence à s'en éloigner, il semble qu'il s'abaisse.</span></span> Cela est assez plaisant, dit-elle, la Terre prend tout sur soy, &amp; ce Soleil ne fait rien. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"29\">Et quand la Lune &amp; les autres Planetes, les Etoiles Fixes paroissent faire un tour sur nostre teste en vingt-quatre heures, c'est donc aussi une imagination? Imagination pure, repris-je, qui vient de la mesme cause. Les Planetes font seulement leurs Cercles autour du Soleil en des temps inégaux selon leurs distances inégales, &amp; celle que nous voyons aujourd'huy répondre à un certain point du Zodiaque, ou de ce Cercle d'Etoiles Fixes, nous la voyons demain répondre à un autre point, tant parce qu'elle a avancé sur son Cercle, que parce que nous avons avancé sur le nostre. Nous marchons, &amp; les autres Planetes marchent aussi; cela nous met dans diferens points de veüe à leur égard, &amp; nous fait paroistre dans leur cours des bizarreries dont il n'est pas necessaire que je vous parle. Il suffit que vous sçachiez que ce qu'il y a d'irregulier dans les Planetes ne vient que de la diverse maniere dont nostre mouvement nous les fait rencontrer, &amp; qu'au fonds elles sont toutes tres-reglées.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"30\">Je consens qu'elles le soient, dit la Marquise, mais je voudrois bien que leur regularité coûtast moins à la Terre, on ne l'a guere ménagée, &amp; pour une grosse masse aussi pesante qu'elle est, on luy demande bien de l'agilité..</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"31\">Mais, luy répondis-je, aimeriez-vous mieux que le Soleil, &amp; tous les autres Astres qui sont de tres-grands Corps, fissent tous les jours en vingt-quatre heures autour de la Terre un tour immense, &amp; un nombre infini de lieües? Car il faudroit qu'ils le fissent si la Terra ne tournoit pas sur elle-mesme en 24 heures.</span></span> </p><p>P010: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"32\">Oh! repliqua-t-elle, le Soleil &amp; les Astres sont tout de feu, le mouvement ne leur coúte rien; mais la Terre ne paroît guere portative.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"33\">Et croiriez-vous, repris-je, si vous n'en aviez point l'experience, que ce fust quelque chose de bien portatif, qu'un gros Navire monté de cent-cinquante pieces de Canon, chargé de plus de trois mille hommes, &amp; d'une tres-grande nombre de Marchãdises? Cependant il ne faut qu'un petit soufle de vent pour le faire aller sur l'eau, parce que l'eau est liquide, &amp; que se laissant diviser avec facilité, elle résiste peu au mouvement du Navire. Ainsi la Terre, toute massive qu'elle est, est aisément portée dans la matiere celeste, qui est mille fois plus fluide que l'eau, &amp; qui remplit tout ce grand espace où nagent les Planetes. Et où faudroit-il que la Terre fust cramponnée pour résister au mouvement de cette matiere celeste, &amp; ne s'y pas laisser emporter? C'est comme si une petite boule de bois pouvoit ne pas suivre le courant d'une Riviere.</span></span></p>","manualHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature. Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use: For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight. Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true. I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it. Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you: The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature. And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King: The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing. But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it. But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular: But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd. 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way: Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful. I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.</p> <p>P012: Know then, that a certain German, named Copernicus, does at one blow cut off all these different Circles, and Christalline Spheres, invented by the Ancients; destroying the one, and breaks the other in pieces; and being inspir'd with a Noble Astronomical Fury, takes the Earth, and hangs it at a vast distance from the Centre of the World, and sets the Sun in its place, to whom that Honour does more properly belong; the Planets do no longer turn round the Earth, nor do they any longer contain it in the Circle they describe; and if they enlighten us, it is by chance, and because they find us in their way: All things now turn round the Sun; among which, the Globe it self, to punish it for the long Rest, so falsly attributed to it before; and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth. Soft and fair, said Madam la Marquiese; you are in so great a Rapture, and express your self with so much Pomp and Eloquence, I hardly understand what you mean: You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth. I understand you, said she: I love the Moon for staying with us, when all the other Planets have left us; and you must confess, that your German Copernicus would have taken her from us too, had it been in his power; for I perceive by his procedure, he had no great kindness for the Earth. I am extreamly pleas'd with him, said I, for having humbled the Vanity of mankind, who had usurp'd the first and best Situation in the Universe; and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets. That's very fine, said the Marquiese: Do you believe that the Vanity of Man places it self in Astronomy; or that I am any way humbled, because you tell me the Earth turns round the Sun? I'll swear, I do not esteem my self one whit the less. Good Lord, Madam, said I, Do you think I can imagine you can be as zealous for a Precedency in the Universe, as you would be for that in a Chamber? No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors: Nevertheless, the same inclination that makes us endeavour to have the first place in a Ceremony, prevails with a Philosopher in composing his System, to place himself in the Centre of the World, if he can: He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation. Oh, said the Marquiese, this is a Calumny of your own invention against mankind, which ought never to have received Copernicus his Opinion, since so easie, and so humble. Copernicus, said I, Madam, himself was the most diffident of his own System; so that it was a long time before he would venture to publish it, and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died. Hold, said the Marquiese, we ought to do Justice to all the World; and 'tis most certain, 'tis very hard to believe we turn round, since we do not change places, and that we find our selves in the Morning, where we lay down the Night before. I see very well by your Looks, what 'tis you are going to say; That since the Earth moves all together - Most certainly, said I: 'Tis the same thing as if you were asleep in a Boat, sailing on a River, you would find your self in the same place in the Morning, and in the same Situation as to the several parts of the Boat. True, said she, but with this difference; I shou'd at my waking, find another Shoar; and that would convince me, my Boat had chang'd its Situation: But 'tis not the same with the Earth; for there I find every thing as I left it the Night before. Not at all, Madam, said I; the Earth changes the Shoar, as well as your Boat. You know, Madam, that above and beyond all the Circles, described by the Planets, is the Sphere of the fixed Stars; that's our Shoar: I am on the Earth, which makes a great Circle round the Sun; I look towards the Centre of this Circle, there I see the Sun; if the brightness of his Rays did not remove the Stars from my sight, by looking in a streight Line, I should easily perceive the Sun corresponding to some fixed Star beyond him; but in the Night-time, I see clearly the Stars, to which the Sun did answer, or was opposite to, the Day before; which is, indeed, the same thing. If the Earth were immoveable, and did not alter its Situation in its own Circle, I shou'd always see the Sun opposite to the same fixed Stars; but I see the Sun in different Opposition to the Stars, every Day of the Year: It most necessarily follows then, the Circle changes its Situation, that is, the Shoar, round which we go daily: And as the Earth performs its Revolution in a Year, I see the Sun, in that space of time, answer in direct Opposition to a whole Circle of fixed Stars; this Circle is called the Zodiack: Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like. Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place. 'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers. Pray, Sir, said she, let Adorers alone, and let us speak of the Sun. I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass? Have you not observ'd, said I, that a Bowl thrown on the Earth, has two different Motions; it runs toward the Jack, to which it is thrown; and at the same time it turns over and over several times, before it comes that Length; so that you will see the Mark that is on the Bowl, sometimes above, and sometimes below: 'Tis just so with the Earth; in the time it advances on the Circle it makes round the Sun, in its yearly Course, it turns over once every four and twenty Hours, upon its own Axis; so that in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting. This is very pleasant, said the Marquiese: You make the Circle to do all, and the Sun to stand idle; and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular. I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly. But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the Sun and Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not seem to be very portable. And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P011: I am extreamly glad, said the Marquiese, that I have learned the Genealogy of the Sciences, and I find that I must content my self with Astronomy, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">Geometry, according to what you have said, requiring a Soul more interested in worldly Concerns, than I am, and for Poetry, 'tis most proper for those of a more Amorous Inclination; but I have all the leisure and time to spare that Astronomy requires: Besides that I live now happily retired in the Fields and Groves, and lead a sort of Pastoral Life, so very agreeable to Astronomy.</span></span> Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I; 'tis not a true Pastoral Life, to talk of Planets and fix'd Stars: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">Be pleased to consider, that the Shepherds in the Story of Astroea did not pass their time in that kind of divertisement; they had business of a softer, and more agreeable Nature.</span></span> Oh, said she, the Life of the Pastorals of Astraea is too dangerous: I like that of the Chaldean Shepherds better, of whom you spoke but now: Go on with them, for I will hear nothing from you, but Chaldean: So soon as that Order, and these Motions of the Heavens were discovered, what was the next thing to be considered? The next thing, said I, was, to guess how the several parts of the Universe were to be disposed and ranged in order; and that is what the Learned call, The making a System: But before, Madam, I explain to you the first System, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">be pleased to observe, that we are all naturally made like a certain Athenian Fool, of whom you have heard; who fansied that all the Ships that came into the Port of Piraa, belonged to him; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">for we are so vain as to believe, that all this vast Frame of Nature was destined to our use</span></span>:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">For if a Philosopher be asked, for what all this prodigious number of fixed Stars serve (since a very few would supply the business of the whole) he will tell you gravely, that they were made to please our sight.</span></span> Upon this Principle, at first, Man believed, that the Earth was immoveably fixed in the Centre of the Universe, whilst all the Celestial Bodies (made only for her) were at the pains of turning continually round, to give Light to the Earth: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">And that it was therefore above the Earth, they placed the Moon; above the Moon, Mercury; then Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter, Saturn; and above all, the Sphere of the fixed Stars: The Earth, according to this Opinion, was just in the middle of the several Circle's, described by the Planets; and the greater these Circles were, the further they were distant from the Earth; and by consequence, they took a longer time in compleating their round; which is certainly true.</span></span> I know not, said the Marquiese, why you should not approve of this Order of the Universe, which seems to be so clear and intelligible; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">for my part, I am extreamly pleased and satisfied with it.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">Madam, said I, without Vanity, I have very much softned and explained this System: Should I expose it to you such as it was first invented by its Author Ptolemy, or by those that have followed his Principles, it would frighten you:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">The motion of the Planets being irregular, they move sometimes fast, sometimes slow; sometimes towards one side, sometimes to another; at one time near the Earth, at another far from it. The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature.</span></span> And the Confusion of these Circles was so great, that at that time, when men knew no better, a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician (not over devout) said, That if God had call'd him to his Council when he form'd the Vniverse, he could have given him good Advice. The thought was impious, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">The Philosophers, to explain one kind of motion of the heavenly Bodies, did fansie a Sphere of Christal above that Heaven which we see, which set the inferior Heaven on motion; and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing.</span></span> But why Spheres of Christal, said Madam la Marquiese? Would no other Substance serve? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams. Aristotle had found out, that Solidity was inherent in the Excellency of their Nature; and because he said it, no body would adventure to question the truth of it.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">But there have appear'd Comets, which we know to have been vastly higher from the Earth, than was believed by the Ancients: These, in their course, wou'd have broke all those Christal Spheres; and indeed, must have ruined the Universe: So that there was an absolute necessity to believe the Heavens to be made of a fluid substance; at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular:</span></span> But I will propose one to you, which solves all Objections, and which will put the King of Arragon out of a condition of advising; and which is so surprisingly simple and easie, that that good quality alone ought to make it preferrable to all others. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd.</span></span> 'Tis very true, said I; and 'tis only by that, that we are able to guess at the Scheme, upon which Nature hath fram'd her Work: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way:</span></span> Yet notwithstanding, this Frugality is accompany'd with a most surprising Magnificence, which shines in all she has done; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution: And indeed, there is nothing finer than a great Design, carried on with a little Expence. But we are very apt to overturn all these Operations of Nature, by contrary Idea's: We put Oeconomy in the Design, and Magnificence in the Execution: We give her a little Design, which we make her perform with ten times a greater Charge than is needful.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">I shall be very glad, said she, that this System, you are to speak of, will imitate Nature so exactly; for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say.

The Ancients did imagine I know not how many Circles, differently interwoven one with another; by which they fansy'd to themselves, they understood all the irregular Phaenomena's, or Appearances in Nature.' adds both a summary and explanatory phrases for clarity.","The phrase 'yet 'tis odd to reflect, that the confusion of Ptolemy's System gave an occasion for the sin of that King' is an interpretive expansion to clarify the satirical point.","The phrase 'The good Advice he would have given, was, no doubt, for surpassing these different Circles, which had so embarrass'd the Celestial Motions; and, it may be also, with regard to the two or three superfluous Spheres, which they had plac'd above the fixed Stars.' adds commentary for clarity.","The phrase 'and if any one made a new discovery of any other Motion, they immediately made a new Sphere of Christal: in short, these Christalline Heavens cost them nothing.' is an explicit logical elaboration of the French 'Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien.'","The explanation 'No, said I, Madam; for there was a necessity of their being transparent, that the Light might penetrate; as it was requisite for them to be solid Beams' is much more detailed and explicit than the French original, adding physical reasoning and indirect speech.","The phrase 'at least, 'tis not to be doubted, from the observation of this, and the last Age, that Venus and Mercury move round the Sun, and not round the Earth. So that the ancient System is not to be defended, as to this particular:' is added to clarify Fontenelle's reference to new observations.","The phrase 'Methinks, said Madam la Marquiese, that your Philosophy is a kind of Sale or Farm, where those that offer to do the Affair at the smallest Expence, are preferr'd.' is an analogy and elaboration for English readers, unpacking the idea of 'enchere' (auction).","The phrase 'She is very saving, and will take the shortest and cheapest way:' is an interpretive condensing and explication.","All the elaborations about 'Magnificence' and 'Oeconomy,' and their inversion, e.g., 'but the Magnificence is in the Design, and the Oeconomy in the Execution:... carried on with a little Expence' and the added explanations, expand metaphors and clarify the concept for readers unfamiliar with the style.","'for this good Husbandry will turn to the advantage of my Understanding, since by it I shall have less trouble to comprehend what you have to say. There is in this System no more unnecessary difficulties.' is a clarifying interpretive addition.","The phrase 'and Copernicus has loaded the Earth with all those Motions, formerly attributed to the other Planets; having left this little Globe none of all the Celestial Train, save only the Moon, whose natural Course it is, to turn round the Earth.' interprets and elaborates the original French for clarity.","'and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth.' adds the reason for the Moon's motion based on the prior logic.","'and I am glad to see the Earth under the same Circumstances with the other Planets.' re-frames the sentiment with additional precision.","'No, Madam; the Rank of Place between two Planets will never make such a bustle in the World, as that of two Ambassadors:' adds a more explicit contrast than the French, fleshing out the argument.","'He is proud to fansie all things made for himself; and without reflexion, flatters his Senses with this Opinion, which consists purely in Speculation.' unpacks and clarifies the psychological mechanism.","'and at last resolv'd to do it at the earnest intreaty of People of the first Quality. But do you know what he did, the Day they brought him the first printed Copy of his Book? That he might not be troubled to answer all the Objections and Contradictions he was sure to meet with, he wisely left the World, and died.' is a witty interpretive expansion for narrative effect.","'Will you please, Madam, that I trace the Figure of it on the Sand? By no means, said she; I can satisfie my self, without that Demonstration: Besides that, it would give a certain Mathematical Air to my Park, which I do not like.' fleshes out the dialogue beyond the French original.","'Have not I heard of a certain Philosopher, who being shipwreck'd, and cast upon an unknown Island; who seeing some Mathematical Propositions drawn on the Sea- sands, called to one of those with him, and cry'd, Courage, my Friend, here are the Foot-steps of Men; this Country is inhabited? You know, it is not decent in me to make such Foot-steps, nor must they be seen in this place.' elaborates the story and explanation for the target audience.","'Tis fit, continued I, Madam, that nothing be seen here, but Steps of Lovers; that is to say, your Name and Cypher engraven on the Bark of Trees by the hand of your Adorers.' translates and embellishes the metaphor for English readers.","'I understand very well, how we imagine he describes that Circle, which, indeed, we our selves describe; but this requires a whole Year's time, when one wou'd think the Sun passes over our heads every day: How comes that to pass?' reformulates and clarifies the question for the reader.","All the details about the bowl, the 'Jack,' the axis, 'in that space of time, which is one natural Day, every point of the Earth (which is not near the South or North-Poles) loses and recovers the sight of the Sun: And as we turn towards the Sun, we imagine the Sun is rising upon us; so when we turn from it, we believe sheis setting.' are interpretive elaborations clarifying and extending the mechanics for a non-expert.","'and when we see the Moon, Planets and fixed Stars turn round us in four and twenty Hours, all is but bare Imagination. Nothing else, said I, but pure Fancy, which proceeds from the same Cause; only the Planets make their Circle round the Sun, not in the same space of time, but according to their unequal distance from it; and that Planet which we see to day, look to a certain Point of the Zodiack, or Sphere of fixed Stars, we shall see it answer to every other Point to Morrow; y as well because that Planet moves on its Course, as that we proceed in ours: We move, and so do the other Planets: By this means we vary both Situation and Opposition, as to them, and we think we discover Irregularities in their Revolutions, which I will not now trouble you with; 'tis sufficient for you to know, that any thing that may appear to us to be irregular, in the Course of the Planets, is occasion'd by our own Motion meeting theirs in such different manners; but upon the whole the Course of the Planets, is most regular.' is an amplified technical explanation intended for clarity.","'I agree with all my heart, said the Marquiese; yet I wish with all my heart, that that Regularity were not so laborious to the Earth: I fansie Copernicus has not been very careful of its Concerns, in making so weighty and solid a Mass run about so nimbly.' is a stylistic expansion and clarification.","'But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, that the Sun, and the Stars (which are generally far greater Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the Earth in a Day, and run an infinite number of Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of necessity do, if the Earth have not that Diurnal Motion on its own Axis.' breaks down the implication more explicitly and adds commentary.","The extended ship comparison: 'And wou'd you believe it, said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, that a First-Rate Ship, of a hundred and twenty Guns, with fifteen hundred Men, and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition and Tackle a-board, were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle Breeze will move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is liquid, and yielding easily, makes no resistance to the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid than the Water of the Sea; and which fills all that vast Extent, where the Planets swim, as it were: And to what wou'd you fix or grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd along with the Current of this Celestial Matter or Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden Ball shou'd not follow the Current of a rapid River.' is more elaborate in technical details than the French, clarifying the analogy."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P011: Mais, repliqua-t-elle encore, comment la Terre avec tout son poids se soûtient-elle sur vostre matiere celeste, qui doit estre bien legere, puis qu'elle est si fluide?

In the French, the description is more concise, taking for granted reader familiarity. The phrase 'which is the Air that is carried round at the same time with it' also explicates and connects the metaphor to the Earth's atmosphere more explicitly.","The translator adds 'that I spoke of' after 'that Celestial Matter' to clarify for English readers that this matter has been mentioned previously, which is inferred in the French but not directly stated.

'Tis certainly true, said I, Madam; while at the same time, Nature, who is not at the pains to consider these Troubles and Commotions, carries us all along together, by a general Motion, and does, as it were, play with this little Globe. It seems to me, said she, that 'tis very ridiculous to inhabit any thing that turns so often, and is so much agitated; and the worst of all is, that we are not assur'd whether we turn round, or not; for, to be plain with you, and that I may keep none of my Doubts from you, I do extreamly suspect, that all the Pre-cautions you can take, will not convince me of the Motion of the Earth: For is it possible, but Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us some sensible Sign, by which we might discover the turning round of so vast a Body?

The phrase 'is not at the pains to consider these Troubles and Commotions' expands upon 'qui n'entre point en connoissance de tous ces petits mouvemens particuliers', making Nature's indifference to human concerns more explicit for the target audience.","The phrase 'that turns so often, and is so much agitated; and the worst of all is, that we are not assur'd whether we turn round, or not; for, to be plain with you, and that I may keep none of my Doubts from you, I do extreamly suspect, that all the Pre-cautions you can take, will not convince me of the Motion of the Earth: For is it possible, but Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us some sensible Sign, by which we might discover the turning round of so vast a Body?' includes several additions: 'that turns so often, and is so much agitated,' 'the worst of all is,' 'to be plain with you, and that I may keep none of my Doubts from you,' and the more explicit 'will not convince me of the Motion of the Earth...but Nature wou'd have taken care to have given us some sensible Sign, by which we might discover the turning round of so vast a Body'. These phrases are elaborations that clarify the Marquise's skepticism and add rhetoric for reader engagement, making her thinking process more transparent.","The translator adds '(answer'd I)' for clarity on who is speaking, uses the phrase 'which are most natural to remove,' to clarify the concept, and changes the structure to make the comparison to morality more didactic for English readers, where the French is more succinct. 'For the Motion of Self-love is so natural to us, that for the most part we do not feel it, while we believe we act by other Principles.' elaborates on the effect of self-love and draws out the implicit moral lesson.","'Ah, said she, do you begin to speak of Moral Philosophy, when the Question is of that which is altogether natural? But I perceive you are sleepy, and begin to yawn;' is an explicit addition in which the translator interprets 'cela s'appelle baailler' (which literally means 'that is called yawning') as the narrator getting sleepy and yawning, which is then expanded by adding 'I perceive you are sleepy, and begin to yawn;' for explicitness and to make the dialogue flow more naturally to an English audience. Similarly, 'for there's enough said for the first Night, to morrow we shall return hither again;' expands 'aussi bien en Voila assez pour la premiere fois. Demain nous reviendrons icy,' making the plan for the next visit more conversational and explicit.","The target segment elaborates substantially by adding interpretive details, such as 'to make an end of what might be said to Systems,' 'my Lady Marquiese, whose Judgment and Understanding is solid and penetrating', and 'its Simplicity and Easiness perswades as much as its Boldness pleases.' These do not appear in the French and serve to explain reasoning, clarify opinions, and add rhetorical flourish and coherence for English readers, thus normalizing the translation for a non-French audience."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P020: SECOND SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P017: The Second Night.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P017: The Second Night.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P021: Le lendemain au matin dés que l'on pût entrer dans l'Appartement de la Marquise, j'envoyay sçavoir de ses nouvelles, &amp; luy demander si elle avoit pû dormir en tournant.

This makes the analogy and the logic more explicit, guiding the reader through the reasoning step-by-step.","The phrases 'and the Sun only is remarkable for that Quality: 'tis he alone that is enlightned of himself, by virtue of his particular Essence; but the other Planets shine only, as being enlightned by the Sun: The Sun communicates his Light to the Moon, which reflects it upon the Earth; as the Earth, without doubt, reflects it back again to the Moon, since the distance from the Moon to the Earth is the same as from the Earth to the Moon.' include a clarification about 'the Sun only is remarkable for that Quality' and 'by virtue of his particular Essence' as well as the assertion 'without doubt,' none of which is directly stated in the French source. These additions provide explanatory elaboration regarding the mechanism and rationale for the reflective properties, making astronomical concepts more explicit for English audiences."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P024: Mais, dit la Marquise, la Terre est-elle aussi propre que la Lune à renvoyer la lumiere au Soleil?

En recompense il n'est pas croyable combien il y a dans la Lune d'Esprits perdus.</span></span> Ce sont autant de Phioles pleines d'une liqueur fort subtile, &amp; qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée, &amp; sur chacune de ces Phioles est écrit le nom de celuy à qui l'Esprit appartient. Je croy que l'Arioste les met toutes en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus tres-sages, estoient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantost Philosophiques, tantost Poëtiques, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientost aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">Le bon Paladin ne manqua pas de trouver la sienne parmytant d'autres. Il s'en saisit avec la permission de Saint Jean, &amp; reprit tout son Esprit par le nez comme de l'Eau de la Reyne de Hongrie; mais l'Arioste dit qu'il ne le porta pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il le laissa retourner dans la Lune par une folie qu'il fit à quelque temps delà.</span></span> Il n'oublia pas la Phiole de Roland, qui estoit le sujet du Voyage. Il eut assez de peine à la porter, car l'Esprit de ce Heros estoit de sa nature assez pesant, &amp; il n'y en manquoit pas une seule goute. Ensuite l'Arioste, selon sa loüable coûtume de dire tout ce qu'il luy plaist, apostrophe sa Maistresse, &amp; luy dit en de fort beaux Vers: Qui montera aux Cieux, ma Belle, pour en rapporter l'esprit que vos charmes m'ont fait perdre? Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allast pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland. Je ne croy pourtant pas que pour ravoir mon esprit, il soit besoin que j'aille par les airs jusque dans la Lune, mon esprit ne loge pas si haut, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">il va errant sur vos yeux, sur vostre bouche, &amp; si vous voulez bien que je m'en resaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres. Cela n'est-il pas joly?</span></span> Pour moy à raisonner comme l'Arioste, je serois d'avis qu'on ne perdist jamais l'esprit que par l'Amour, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">car vous voyez qu'il ne va pas bien loin, &amp; qu'il ne faut que des lévres qui sçachent le recouvrer; mais quand on le perd par d'autres voyes, comme nous le perdons, par exemple, à philosopher presentement, il va dans la Lune, &amp; on ne le ratrape pas quand on veut.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">En recompense, répondit la Marquise, nos Phioles seront honorablement dans le Quartier des Phioles philosophiques, au lieu que nos Esprits iroient peut-estre icy errans sur quelqu'un qui n'en seroit pas digne. Mais pour achever de m'oster le mien, dites-moy, &amp; dites-moy bien serieusement, si vous croyez qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune, car jusqu'à present vous ne m'en avez pas parlé d'une maniere assez positive.</span></span> Moy, repris-je: Je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">Voyez combien la face de la Nature est changée d'icy à la Chine; d'autres Visages, d'autres Figures, d'autres Moeurs, &amp; presque d'autres Principes de raisonnement. D'icy à la Lune le changement doit estre bien plus considerable. Quand on va vers de certaines Terres nouvellement découvertes, à peine sont-ce des Hommes que les Habitans qu'on y trouve; ce sont des Animaux à figure humaine, encore quelque fois assez imparfaite, mais presque sans aucune raison humaine; qui pourroit pousser jusqu'à la Lune, assurément ce ne seroient plus des Hommes qu'on y trouveroit.</span></span> </p><p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience? De bonne foy, Madame, repliquay-je, je n'en sçay rien. S'il se pouvoit faire que nous eussions de la raison, &amp; que nous ne fussions pourtant pas Hommes; &amp; si d'ailleurs <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">nous habitions la Lune, nous imaginerions-nous bien qu'il y eust ici-bas cette espece bizarre de Creatures, qu'on appelle le Genre humain? Pourrions-nous bien nous figurer quelque chose qui eust des passions si folles, &amp; des reflexions si sages; une durée si courte, &amp; des veües si longues; tant de Science sur des choses presque inutiles, &amp; tant d'ignorance sur les plus importantes; tant d'ardeur pour la Liberté, &amp; tant d'inclination à la Servitude; une si forte envie d'estre heureux, &amp; une si grande incapacité de l'estre? Il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mesmes, &amp; nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits. On a esté réduit à dire que les Dieux estoient pleins de Nectar lors qu'ils firent les Hommes, &amp; que quand ils vinrent à regarder leur Ouvrage de sens froid, ils ne pûrent s'empêcher d'en rire.</span></span> Nous voila donc bien en seureté du costé des Gens de la Lune, dit la Marquise, ils ne nous devineront pas; mais je voudrais que nous les peussions deviner, car en verité cela m'inquiete de sçavoir qu'ils sont là-haut, dans cette Lune que nous voyons, &amp; de ne pouvoir pas nous figurer comment ils sont faits. Et pourquoy, rêpondis-je, n'avez-vous point d'inquietude sur les Habitans de cette grande Terre Australe qui nous est encore entierement inconnüe? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">Nous sommes portés eux &amp; nous sur un mesme Vaisseau dont ils occupent la Proüe, &amp; nous la Pouppe. Vous voyez que de la Pouppe à la Proüe il n'y a aucune communication, &amp; qu'à un bout du Navire on ne sçait point quelles Gens sont à l'autre, ny ce qu'ils y font, &amp; vous voudriez sçavoir ce qui se passe dans la Lune, dans cet autre Vaisseau qui navige loin de nous par les Cieux?</span></span> </p><p>P037: Oh! reprit-elle, je compte les Habitans de la Terre Australe pour connus, parce qu'assurément ils doivent nous ressembler beaucoup, &amp; qu'enfin on les connoistra quand on voudra se donner la peine de les aller voir; ils demeureront toûjours là, &amp; ne nous échaperont pas, mais ces Gens de la Lune, on ne les connoistra jamais, cela est desesperant. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Si je vous répondois serieusement, repliquay-je, qu'on ne sçait ce qui arrivera, vous vous moqueriez de moy, &amp; je le meriterois sans doute. Cependant je me défendrois assez bien, si je voulois.</span></span> J'ay une pensée tres-ridicule, qui a un air de vraysemblance qui me surprend, je ne sçay où elle peut l'avoir pris, étant aussi impertinente qu'elle est. Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'estat où estoit l'Amerique avant qu'elle eust esté découverte par Christophle Colomb. Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême. Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes.</span></span> Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eust dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Ameriquains plus propres à estre traversées? En verité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous estes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires.</span></span> L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siecles à venir. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"17\">Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mestier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien.</span></span> Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"18\">Les Européens n'ont esté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les gens de la Lune sçavent peut-estre déja faire de petits voyages dans l'air; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sçait quelle surprise.</span></span> Vous estes insuportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celuy-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sçay bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"19\">Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien seurs que la Zone Torride, &amp; les Zones Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur, &amp; du temps des Romains la Carte generale de la Terre n'estoit guere plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté.</span></span> En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"20\">Vous m'entendez-bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens. Le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous, on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu nostre habitation, il nous sera permis de connoistre celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune.</span></span> Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"21\">J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la verité qui persuade, mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves. Elle entre si naturellement dans l'esprit, qu'il semble qu'on ne fasse que se souvenir d'elle, quand on l'apprend pour la premiere fois.</span></span> Ah! vous me soulagez, repliqua la Marquise, vostre faux raisonnement m'incommodoit, &amp; me faisoit mal, &amp; je me sens plus en état d'aller me coucher tranquillement, si vous voulez bien que nous nous retirions. </p>","manualHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it. I own, I ought not to meddle with St. Iohn, whose Name is so worthy of Respect: But since there is a Poetical Licence, and Liberty of Conscience, it ought to pass as a Gayety. The whole Poem is dedicated to a great Church-man, and another great Church-man has honour'd it with a signal Approbation; which one may perceive by the several Editions. See what he treats of.</p> <p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon; Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">waiting and depending on promising States-men</span></span>, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and Dedications</span></span> one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs. I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self. The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after: But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse.</p> <p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</p> <p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases. In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</p> <p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there. What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made. It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us. Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon. Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts</span></span>; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary. If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd; and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another. 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely. Pardon me, said I, Madam, the Europaeans did not sail to America, till after six thousand years, all that time was requisite for performing Navigation. The Inhabitants of the Moon, it may be, at that time, knew how to make little Journeys in the Air, and are now practising; and it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us. This is insupportable, said the Marquiese, to banter me on thus with such frivolous Arguments. If you anger me, said I, I know what I have to say to enforce 'em, and make all good. Observe, Madam, how the World is daily more and more unfolded. The Ancients believed the torrid and the frozen Zones uninhabituable for extremity of cold or heat: And the Romans confin'd the general Map of the World to their own Empire, which carry'd as much of Grandure as Ignorance. But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented. Then it was believed, that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, except what was inhabited: And that there was no Antipodes; for the Ancients never heard of them: Besides they cou'd not believe Men cou'd have their Feet opposite to ours, with their Heads hanging down; and yet after all this the Antipodes are discover'd, the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon. Certainly, said the Marquiese, looking earnestly on me, I see you so charmed with this Opinion, that I doubt not but you believe all you say. I shou'd be very sorry to find my self so, said I; my endeavour is only to show, that chimerical Opinion may be so far defended by strength of Argument, as to amuse a Person of your Understanding and Sense, but not to perswade: Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P025: But, reply'd the Marquiese, I shou'd be very well pleas'd to have a farther Account of this Country. 'Tis impossible, reply'd I, that the nicest Observators shou'd inform you so well as Astolpho, of whom you ought to enquire; and who was conducted to the Moon by St. Iohn. What I shall tell you now, is one of the most pleasant Fooleries in all Ariosto; and I am satisfy'd, 'twill not displease you to know it.

See what he treats of.</span></span> </p><p>P026: Orlando Nephew to Charlemain, became mad, because the fair Angelica had proffer'd Medora to him; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">one day Astolpho the brave Paladine, found himself in a terrestrial Paradise, which was on the brink of a very high Mountain whither his flying Horse had carry'd him; there he met Saint-who told him that to cure the Madness of Orlando, 'twas necessary they shou'd take a Voyage to the Moon;</span></span> Astolpho who desir'd nothing more than to see that Country, wanted no intreaties, and behold on a sudden a Chariot of Fire carry'd the Saint, and the Paladine through the Air. As Astolpho was no great Philosopher, he was much surpriz'd to see the Moon so vastly bigger than it had appeared to him upon the Earth, and was much more amaz'd to see Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Plains, Groves, Towns, and Forests, (and that which wou'd have surpriz'd me also) beautiful Nymphs that hunted in those Forests. But that which he beheld yet more rare, was a Valley where he found all things that were lost on Earth, of what kind soever, Crowns, Riches, Renown, and Grandure, Infinity of hopes, time lost in waiting and depending on promising States-men, or thrown away at Play; the Alms that one causes to be given after ones Death; The Verses and Dedications one presents to Princes and the sighs of Lovers. As for the Sighs of Lovers, reply'd the Marquiese, interrupting me, I know not whether in the time of Ariosto they were lost or not, but in ours, I know of none that go into the Moon. Were there none but you Madam reply'd I, smiling, you have caus'd so many to sigh in vain, that you have made a considerable Treasure in the Moon: in short the Moon is exact in collecting all that is lost here below, and which are all to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine. (But Astolpho told me this only in my Ear.) <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Besides all the Folly that was ever committed upon the Earth is well preserv'd there; these are so many Vials full of a subtil and penetrating Liquor, which easily evaporates as soon as opened, and upon every one of these Vials is writ the name of those to whom it belongs.</span></span> I believe that Ariosto put 'em all in one Cup, but I had rather fansie to my self that they were orderly plac'd in one Gallery. Astolpho was very much astonisht to see the Vials of so many Persons whom he believed to be very wise, and yet notwithstanding their Vials were so very full; and for my part, I am perswaded that mine is as full as any since I entertain you with Visions, both Philophick and poetical. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">That which comforts me is, that 'tis possible by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self.</span></span> The good Paladine did not fail to find his own among the Number, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">and by the Permission of the Saint, he took it and snuff'd up the Spirit as if it had been the Queen of Hungary's Water: But Ariosto said he wou'd not carry it far, and that it wou'd return to the Moon again by a Folly that he committed seven Years after:</span></span> But he did not forget the Vial of Orlando which was the occasion of his Voyage; he had a great deal of difficulty to carry it, for the Spirit of this Hero was in its own Nature very heavy, and did not want a drop of being full. But here Ariosto according to the laudable Custom of speaking what he pleas'd, addressing himself to his Mistriss, speaks to her thus in good Verse. </p><p>P027: That I ought to cause one to mount the Heavens, my fair one, to make me recover the Senses your Charms have made me lose, yet I will not complain of this Loss, provided it does not go too far, but if there be a Necessity that your Cruelties must continue, as they have begun, I have no more to do but to expect just such a Fate as Orlando's; however I do not believe, that to recover my Senses 'tis requisite I go through the Air to the Moon; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.</span></span> </p><p>P028: Is not this witty for me to reason like Ariosto? I am of opinion that a Man never loses his Wits but for Love; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">and you see they do not travel far, while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em. But when one loses 'em by other means (as we lose 'em by Philosophizing) they go directly to the Moon, and one cannot retrieve 'em when one pleases.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">In recompence of this, said the Marquiese, our Vials shall be Honourable among the Ranks of the Philosophers: For our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.</span></span> </p><p>P029: But pray tell me seriously, said the Marquiese, do you believe that there are Men in the Moon? For hitherto, you have said nothing to me positively as to that. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">I do not believe there are Men there, Madam, but some other odd sort of Creatures: Pray, Madam, consider but how much the Face of Nature is chang'd betwixt this and China; other Faces, other Shapes, other Manners, and almost quite different Principles of reasoning, from this to the Moon the difference ought to be more considerable. When one travels towards the new discovered World of America, &amp;c. and finds the Inhabitants there to be hardly Men, but rather a kind of Brutes in humane shape, and that not perfect neither, so that could we travel to the Orb of the Moon, I do not think we should find Men and Women there.</span></span> What kind of Creatures should we find then said the Marquiese, with a very impatient look? I swear I cannot tell, said I Madam, were it possible for us to be rational Creatures and yet not Men, and that we inhabited the Moon, cou'd it ever enter into our Imagination, that there dwelt here below so extravagant an Animal as that of Mankind? Could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions, and so wise Reflections; of so small Duration, and yet can see so vast a Prospect beyond it; of so much knowledge in Trifles, and so much Ignorance of important things; so earnest for liberty, yet so enclin'd to servitude and Slavery; so very desirous of Happiness, and yet so uncapable of attaining it; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made.</span></span> It was said of old amongst the Heathens, that the Gods when they made Man were drunk with Nectar, whom when they had consider'd when sober, they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ridiculousness of their handy Work. We are then secure enough, said the Marquiese, that the Inhabitants of the Moon will never guess what we are; but I wish we could attain to the knowledge of them; for I must confess it makes me uneasie to think there are Inhabitants in the Moon, and yet I cannot so much as fansie what kind of Creatures they are. And why are you not as uneasie, said I, upon the account of the Inhabitants under and near the South-Pole, which is altogether unknown to us? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head; and yet you see there is no communication between the Stern and the Head, and that those at the one end of the Ship do not know what kind of People they are on the other, nor what they are doing, and yet you would know what passes in the Moon, in that other great Ship sailing in the Heavens at a vast distance from us.</span></span> Ah, said the Marquiese, I look upon the Inhabitants under the South-Pole, as a People known to us, because they are most certainly very like us; and that we may see them if we please to give our selves the trouble; they will continue still where they are, and cannot run away from our knowledge; but we shall never know what these Inhabitants of the Moon are; 'tis that that vexes me. If I shou'd answer you seriously, said I, that we may one day know 'em, wou'd not you laugh at me? Nay and I shou'd deserve it: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"12\">Yet I cou'd defend my self very well if I shou'd say so; there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon.</span></span> Reflect a little, Madam, upon the State and Condition of America, before it was discovered by Christopher Columbus; it's Inhabitants liv'd in a most profound Ignorance, so far from the knowledge of Sciences, that they were ignorant of the most simple and useful Art: They went stark naked and cou'd not imagine that Men cou'd be cover'd by Skins of Beasts; had no other Arms but Bows, and who look upon the Sea as a vast space forbidden to mankind, joining, as they thought, to the Sky; beyond which they saw nothing. 'Tis true after having spent several years with hollowing the root of a great Tree with sharp Flints, they after ventur'd to go in this kind of Boat, which was driven along the Shore by the Winds and the Waves; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"13\">but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary.</span></span> If any Body had told them there was a Navigation much more perfect than that they knew; and that by it, it was easie to cross that vast extent of Water to any side, and in what manner we pleas'd, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"14\">and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd;</span></span> and that the Sea, notwithstanding the vastness of its extent, was no hindrance to the commerce of distant Nations, provided that there were People on the other shoar; surely the Indians wou'd never have believ'd that Man that should have told 'em this, to them impossibility: nevertheless, the day came, that the strangest and least expected Sight that ever they saw, presented it self to their view, huge great Bodies, which seem'd to have white wings with which they flew upon the Sea belching Fire from all parts, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"15\">and at last landed upon their shoar a Race of unknown Men, all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder? are they Gods or the Children of the Sun? for certainly, they are not Men.</span></span> I know not, Madam, whether you conceive as I do, the extraordinary surprize of these Americans, but certainly there was never any equal to it; and after that, I will not swear, but there may be one day, a commerce betwixt the Earth and the Moon: Had the Americans, any Reason to hope for a correspondence betwixt America and Europe, (which they did not know?) It is true, there will be a Necessity to cross the vast Extent of Air and Heaven that is betwixt the Earth and the Moon. But did these Americans think the Ocean more proper to be crossed, and pass'd through? Sure, said the Marquiese, you are mad; and looking earnestly on me; I do not deny it, answer'd I; nay, said she, it is not sufficient to confess it, I will prove you to be mad. The Americans were so ignorant, that the Possibility of making a way or passage through the vast Ocean, cou'd never enter into their Thoughts; but we that know so much, we easily find out that it wou'd be no hard matter to pass through the Air if we cou'd support our selves. There are those Men, said I, who have found out more than a possibility of it; for they actually begin to fly a little, and several have made and fitted wings to themselves, and invented a way to give themselves Motion, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"16\">for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another.</span></span> 'Tis true, these were not flights of an Eagle; and it has cost some of these new Birds a Leg or an Arm: But this Essay is like the first Planks that were carry'd on the Water, which yet gave beginnings to shipping; and there was a very great difference between these Planks and Ships of mighty burden; yet you see that time by degrees has produc'd great Ships. The Art of flying is but in its Infancy, time must bring it to Maturity, and one day Men will be able to fly to the Moon. Do you pretend to have discover'd all things, said she, or to have brought them to that perfection that nothing can be added? Pray, Madam, said I, by consent, let us save something for the Age to come. I will never yield, said she, that Men will ever be able to fly without breaking their Necks. Well, said I, Madam, since you will needs have Men always to fly so ill, it may be the Inhabitants of the Moon will fly better, and will be fitter for that Trade; for 'tis all one, if we go to them or they to us. And we shall be like the Americans, who did not believe Navigation possible, when at the same time, sailing was so well understood on the other half of the Globe. Sure, said she, in anger, the Inhabitants of the Moon wou'd have been with us before now, if that were likely.

This is likely to contextualize the Renaissance poetic concept of 'licence' for a post-Reformation English audience, connecting poetic liberty to the prominent English debate on liberty of conscience.","The translator changes 'la cime d'une Montagne tres-haute' ('the summit of a very high mountain') to 'the brink of a very high Mountain,' introducing an image of the edge or brink not in the source, amplifying the sense of adventure for the English reader.","The translator adds 'penetrating' and elaborates the liquid as 'which easily evaporates as soon as opened.' The original says only 'liqueur fort subtile, & qui s'évapore aisément si elle n'est enfermée.' The English emphasizes the action of opening the vials, clarifying for readers how the spirits inside are lost.","The phrase 'by what I am perswading you to believe, I shall very suddenly make you have a Vial in the Moon as well as my self' is more direct in the English; the French original says only 'par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientost aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune.' The translator explicitly connects 'persuading you to believe' and acquiring a vial, emphasizing the narrator's power.","'snuff'd up the Spirit' is more specific than the simple 'reprit tout son Esprit par le nez.' The French does not specify snuffing, but simply 'by the nose.' The translator uses 'snuff'd up' and compares to 'the Queen of Hungary's Water,' making the metaphor more vivid and accessible to English readers, familiar with the popular scented water.","The English says 'my Soul does not lodge so high; it wanders about your fair Eyes, and Mouth; and if you will be pleas'd to give me leave to take it, permit me to recover it with my Lips.' The French says only 'il va errant sur vos yeux, sur vostre bouche, & si vous voulez bien que je m'en resaisisse, permettez que je le recueille avec mes lèvres.' The addition of 'be pleas'd to give me leave to take it' elaborates the courtly theme for English readers.","'while their Lips only know so well how to recover 'em' is an addition; the French original does not specify 'Lips only know so well how to recover 'em', only 'il ne faut que des lévres qui sçachent le recouvrer.' The English version amplifies the skill and agency of the lips.","The translator splits, resumes, and expands the sense, with 'In recompence of this... our Spirits will go on in wandring and erring on something that is worthy of 'em; but to accomplish this, and rid me of mine.' The French is more compact and does not include the notion of being 'worthy of them,' nor a meta-comment on being 'rid of mine.' The addition emphasizes the value of their wandering spirits.","After saying 'I do not believe there are Men,' the English continues with 'but some other odd sort of Creatures,' which is not present. The French only says 'je ne crois point du tout qu'il y ait des Hommes dans la Lune.' The English addition foregrounds the idea of alternate lunar beings.","The English adds an abstract speculation: 'it wou'd require a great deal of Wit and Judgment in the Inhabitants of the Moon, to find the Reason and Mystery of such an odd composition; for we that see one another daily, have not as yet found out how we are made.' while the French stops at 'il faudroit que les Gens de la Lune eussent bien de l'esprit, s'ils devinoient tout cela. Nous nous voyons incessamment nous-mesmes, & nous en sommes encore à deviner comment nous sommes faits.' The translator makes the challenge to lunar reasoning more explicit.","The English introduces 'could we fansie to our selves any living Creatures with such foolish Passions...' and then repeats the 'it wou'd require a great deal of Wit...' section, which is more elaborated than in the original; this presents the philosophical paradox in more detail for the reader.","The description of 'They and we are carried as it were in the same Ship, they in the Stern, and we in the Head...' does not exist as such; the French simply juxtaposes 'Proüe' and 'Pouppe', not using the metaphor of the ship's 'stern' and 'head.' It's clarified as a metaphor for readers unfamiliar with French nautical terms.","The translator adds a new phrase: 'there is a certain ridiculous thought in my Head, which has some shadow of likelihood, which satisfies me, tho I do not know on what it is founded, it being so impertinent as it is; yet I will lay you what you will, that I will oblige you to believe against all Reason, that there may one day be a correspondence between the Earth and the Moon.' The French is more concise; the translator adds argument and elaboration for dramatic effect.","'but as this kind of Vessel was very subject to be over-set very often, they were necessitated to swim to catch their Boat again; and indeed, they did swim for the most part, except when they were weary.' The French says only, 'ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient.' The English shifts 'delasser' (to rest) to 'weary,' focusing on fatigue as the reason for pausing.","'and that it was possible to stop and lie still in the midst of the Waves, while the Vessel is in Motion; that Men cou'd move fast or slow as they pleas'd;' is more detailed than the French, which just says, 'qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit.' The English version breaks up and explicates the types of control over the vessel for clarity.","The English adds several metaphoric phrases: 'all crusted over with pollish'd Steel, ordering and disposing at their Pleasure the Monsters that brought 'em thither, carrying Thunder in their Hands which destroy'd all that made any resistance, while the wondring Indians cried, from whence came they? who brought them over the Seas? who has given 'em the Power of Fire and Thunder?' The original does not elaborate these actions in such detail or specify the reactions of the Indians in direct speech.","'for supporting the Body in the Air, for crossing of Rivers, and flying from one steeple to another.' This explicit enumeration translates and adds to 'de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre,' expanding slightly with the purpose 'supporting the Body.'","'it may be when they have more skill, we shall see 'em. And God knows what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us.' The source mentions only seeing them and being surprised; the English adds 'what a strange Surprise 'twill be to us,' emphasizing the marvel.","But we know that there are Inhabitants both in these extreme hot, and extreme cold Countries; by this the World is much augmented.' The French says only 'Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, & dans des Païs tres-chauds, & dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté.' The English recasts as a statement of world knowledge and progress.","the Map of the World is corrected, and a new half added to the World. You understand my meaning, said I, Madam; these Antipodes which have been discover'd contrary to all Expectation, ought to make us more circumspect in judging by appearances: The World, and secrets of Nature will be daily more and more discover'd; and at last we may come to know somewhat more of the Moon.' The French is less explicit about 'the secrets of Nature' being daily more discover'd. The translator adds philosophical emphasis about expanding knowledge.","'Nothing but truth it self has that Influence; even without the Ornaments of all its convincing Proofs; it penetrates so naturally into the Soul, that one seems but to call it to mind; tho it be the first time that ever one heard of it. Now you ease me, said she, for your false way of arguing did confound and incommode me, but now I can go sleep soundly; so, if you please, let us retire.' This conclusion gives reasons—'convincing Proofs,' 'penetrates so naturally into the Soul'—and then includes dialogue about the Marquise's relief and going to sleep, expanding the emotional closure of the conversation."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P038: TROISIEME SOIR.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P030: The Third Night.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P030: The Third Night.</p>","explanations":[]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P039: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">La Marquise voulut mégager pendant le jour à poursuivre nos Entretiens</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">mais je luy representay que nous ne devions confier nos chimeres qu'à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles, puis qu'aussi-bien elles en étoient l'objet.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">Nous ne manquasmes pas à aller le soir dans le Parc, qui devenoit un lieu consacré à nos Conuersations sçavantes.</span></span> </p><p>P040: J'ai bien des nouvelles à vous apprendre, luy dis-je, la Lune que je vous disois hier qui selon toutes les apparences estoit habitée, pourroit bien ne l'être point; j'ay pensé à une chose qui met ses Habitants en peril.

Et quoy, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-estre que de grandes cavitez. De la distance ou nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, repliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, j'ay pris pour eux une inclination que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la verité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantost une partie, tantost une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes. Mais ces mesmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mesmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour estre imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mesmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-mesme, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.</span></span>) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme nostre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de nostre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable. Sur ce pied-là, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">il faudra que la matiere étant disposée dans la Lune autrement que sur la Terre, les effets soient diferens, mais il n'importe; du moment que nous avons trouvé un mouvement interieur dans les parties de la Lune, ou produit par des causes étrangeres, voila ses Habitans qui renaissent, &amp; nous avons le fond necessaire pour leur subsistance.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">Cela nous fournira des fruits, des bleds, des eaux, &amp; tout ce que nous voudrons.

We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment. I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger. I shall never suffer that, said the Marquiese; for you having prepar'd me last Night, put me in hopes to see these People arrive one Day upon our Earth; and to day, you will not allow them a being in the Universe: You shall not impose upon me at this rate. You made me believe there were Inhabitants in the Moon; I have overcome all the Difficulties my Reason suggested to me against that Opinion, and now I am resolv'd I will believe it. You go too fast, said I, Madam; one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion. I am not to be deluded, reply'd the Marquiese, with fair Words; let us come to the subject matter in debate: Must not we reason the same way of the Inhabitants of the Moon, as we did of your St. Denis? Not at all, Madam, answer'd I; the Moon does not so much resemble the Earth, as St. Denis does Paris. The Sun draws from the Earth, Waters, Exhalations and Vapours; which ascending into the Air, to a certain heighth, are gather'd together, and form Clouds; these Clouds, hanging in the Air, move regularly round our Globe, and over shadows sometimes one Country, sometimes another: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">And if it were possible for any one to see and consider</span></span> the Earth at a great distance, he wou'd perceive great Changes as to the appearance of its Surface; for a great Country, cover'd with Clouds, wou'd appear to be a very obscure part of the Globe, and will become clear and enlightned as soon as these Clouds dis-appear; and one wou'd see these obscure places change their Situation, meeting together in different Figures, or disappearing all together. We shou'd see therefore the same Changes upon the Surface of the Moon, were it encompass'd with Clouds, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">as the Earth</span></span> is; but on the contrary, all the Obscurities, or dark places, as also those parts that are enlightned, are still the same, fix'd to the same Situation, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">without Variation or Change</span></span>; there lies the difficulty: And for this reason, the Sun draws no Vapours or Exhalation from the Globe of the Moon; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and by consequence</span></span>, 'tis a Body infinitely harder, and more solid than our Earth, whose subtile parts are easily separated from the rest, and mount upward, being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun: So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd; which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other. Who can then be the Inhabitants of those Rocks that produce nothing? Or what living Creatures can subsist in a Country without Water? How! cry'd my Lady Marquiese; Have you forgot that you assur'd me, there were Seas in the Moon, which we cou'd distinguish from hence? That's only a Conjecture, said I; and I am very sorry that these obscure places, that may be taken for Seas, are, possibly, nothing else <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">but deep Caverns</span></span>, and vast Cavities; and guessing is pardonable, at the great distance we are <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">at from the Moon</span></span>. But, said she, is that sufficient to make us reject the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not altogether, Madam, said I; nor must we absolutely declare either for 'em, or against 'em. I confess my weakness, said she; I am not capable of such Indifference, and I must be positive in my Belief; therefore let us free our selves of one Opinion; let us either preserve the Inhabitants of the Moon, or annihilate 'em for ever, never to be heard of again; but, if possible, let us preserve 'em, for I have an Inclination <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and a Kindness</span></span> for 'em, I wou'd not willingly lose. I shall not unpeople the Moon then, Madam, said I, but for your sake shall restore to it its Inhabitants: And the truth is, that by the Appearance of the obscure and enlightened places of the Moon, which are still the same, without change, we have no reason to believe that there are any Clouds surrounding it, which might obscure sometimes one place, sometimes another; but yet that does not argue, but she may emit Vapours and Exhalations: Our Clouds which we see carry'd in the Air, are nothing but Exhalations and Vapours, which are separate in Particles, too small to be seen; which meeting with cold Airs, as they ascend, by it are condensed, and render'd visible to us, by the Re-union of their Parts; after which, they become thick and black Clouds, which float in the Air, as Stranger-Bo?dies, till at last they fall upon the Earth in Rain: But sometimes it falls out, that the same Vapours and Exhalations are extended, and kept from joining together, and so are imperceptible, and are only gather'd together so far as to form a kind of <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">small Dew</span></span>, so very subtile, that it cannot be seen as 'tis a-falling. It may be, in like manner, that the Vapours which proceed from the Moon <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">(for certainly it emits Vapours;)</span></span> and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another. It may be therefore, as I said, that Vapours which arise from the Moon are not gather'd together, as a rounded Surface, into Clouds, but fall gently upon it again in insensible Dews, and not in Rain: And 'tis sufficient to demonstrate this, to conjecture only, that the Air which environs the Moon, is as different from the Air that environs the Earth, as the Vapours of the Air from the Exhalations of the other; which is more than likely to be true; and it must follow, that Matter being otherwise dispos'd of in the Moon, than in the Earth, its effects shou'd also be different; and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence</span></span>; so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little. That is to say, said the Marquiese, that you only know, that all is very well there, without knowing in what manner; that is a great deal of Ignorance, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">with a little Knowledge</span></span>; but we must have patience: However, I think my self very happy, you have restored the Moon its Inhabitants again; and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P031: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">MY Lady Marquiese wou'd needs engage me to pursue and continue our Discourse by Day- light;</span></span> but I told her, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">'twas more proper to reserve our Fancies and Notions till the Night; and since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them.</span></span> We did not fail to go that Evening into the Park, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment.</span></span> I have a great deal of News to tell you, said I: The Moon, which I told you last Night (by all appearance) was inhabited, now I begin to think, may be otherwise; for I have been reflecting upon a thing, which puts its Inhabitants in great danger.

The French simply says 'pendant le jour', but the English makes the daylight aspect more explicit.","The translator added 'and Notions' to 'Fancies' (for 'chimeres'), and also reworded the sentence to include 'since the Moon and Stars were the Subjects of our Conversation, to trust it only to them,' which is an explicit explanatory normalization not directly in the source text. This addition helps clarify the reasoning for reserving their musings for the nighttime.","The phrase 'which was now become a place consecrated to our Philosophical Entertainment' adds 'Philosophical Entertainment,' where the source just has 'un lieu consacré à nos Conversations sçavantes.' The translation expands 'Conversations sçavantes' into the more cultural and explanatory term 'Philosophical Entertainment,' giving additional connotation and normalization for English readers.","The phrase 'one ought to give but one half of ones Thoughts and Belief to Opinions of this nature, reserving the other half free for receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion' elaborates slightly and clarifies the meaning for the English reader. While not dramatically different, the more organized structure and dual reference of 'Thoughts and Belief' and 'receiving the contrary Opinion, if there be occasion' is an explicative addition.","The translator introduces 'and by consequence,' and the explicit phrase 'being once set in motion by the heat of the Sun' is added to clarify the cause of the parts rising, which the French expresses more succinctly. This increases clarity for the English reader.","The translator expands 'Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers & de Marbres' to 'So that the Moon must needs be nothing else but a vast heap of Rocks and Marble, from which no Vapour can be exhal'd'. The description 'from which no Vapour can be exhal'd' explicitly paraphrases and adds directness to the idea of 'point d'évaporations', making the reasoning and outcome plainer.","'which Vapours are so essential and natural to Waters, that 'tis impossible the one can be without the other.' is an explicative and slightly added clarificatory rephrasing beyond 'elles se font si naturellement & si necessairement ou il y a des Eaux, qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point.' The translation emphasizes the logical connection as an essential, inseparable natural law.","'and 'tis impossible to believe, that the Moon can be such a Body, as that all its parts shou'd be of an equal Solidity, and so equal a temper, one with the other, that they are incapable of receiving any Change, by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em: We know no Body of this nature, the hardest Marbles are not of this kind; and there is no Body, how hard and solid soever, but is subject to Change and Alteration, either by secret and invisible Motion in it self, or by some exterior Impulse it receives from another.' The translation expands the French passage with elaborations such as 'and so equal a temper, one with the other,' and the phrase 'by the attracting and moving Influence of the Sun upon 'em,' which adds extra cause-and-effect explanation not directly expressed in the source.","The translation adds 'and imports nothing, whether it be an interior Motion of the parts of the Moon, or the Production of external Causes, which furnish it with Inhabitants, and them with a sufficient Food for their Subsistence;'. This elaborates and explains interior and exterior causes in more detail, attributing the continued existence or sustenance of inhabitants directly to these causes, which is more implicit and less itemized in the French.","The phrase 'so that, in our Imagination, we may furnish 'em with Fruits and Grain of several sorts, Waters, and what else we please; for Fruit, Grain and Water, I understand, are agreeable to the nature of the Moon, of whose Nature I know nothing; and all these proportion'd and fitted to the Necessities of the Inhabitants, of whom I know as little.' The translator explicates the process by which they 'furnish em' with these things and makes explicit that 'in our Imagination' we may do so as we please, which is slightly more elaborate than the source.","'and I am very much pleas'd, you have surrounded it with Air of its own; for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked.' The phrase 'for without that, I shou'd think a Planet too naked' is an explanatory and stylistically normalizing addition clarifying why the presence of an atmosphere (air) is so important to the Marquiese."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P042: Ces deux Airs diferens, repris-je, contribuent à empescher la communication des deux Planetes.

On a de beaux jours toûjours serains pendant lesquels on ne perd point le Soleil de veuë.

Peut-estre aussi est-ce à cause de cela que la Nature a creusé dans la Lune des especes de Puits, qui sont assez grands pour estre apperceus par nos Lunettes; car ce ne sont point des Vallées qui soient entre des Montagnes, ce sont des creux que l'on voit au milieu de certains lieux plats. Que sçait-on si les Habitans de la Lune, incommodez par l'ardeur perpetuelle du Soleil, ne se refugient point dans ces grands Puits? Ils n'habitent peut-estre point ailleurs, c'est-là qu'ils bâtissent leurs Villes. Nous voyons icy que la Rome soûterraine estoit presque aussi grande que la Rome qui estoit sur Terre. Il ne faudroit qu'oster celle-cy, le reste seroit une Ville à la maniere de la Lune. Tout un Peuple est dans un Puits, &amp; d'un Puits à l'autre il y a des chemins soûterrains pour la communication des Peuples. Vous vous mocquez de cette vision, j'y consens de tout mon cœr; cependant, à vous parler tres serieusement, vous pourriez vous tromper plûtost que moy. Vous croyez que les Gens de la Lune doivent habiter sur la surface de leur Planete, parce que nous habitons sur la surface de la nostre: c'est tout le contraire, puisque nous habitons sur la surface de nostre Planete, ils pourroient bien n'habiter pas sur la surface de la leur.

Toute leur felicité consiste en ce qu'elles y entendent l'Harmonie que les Corps Celestes font par leurs mouvemens; mais comme il pretend que quand la Lune tombe dans l'ombre de la Terre, elles ne peuvent plus entendre cette Harmonie; alors, dit-il, ces Ames crient comme des desesperées, &amp; la Lune se haste le plus qu'elle peut de les tirer d'un endroit si facheux.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">Nous devrions donc, repliqua-t-elle, voir arriver icy les Bienheureux de la Lune, car apparemment on nous les envoye aussi, &amp; dans ces deux Planetes on croit avoir assez pourveu à la felicité des Ames, de les avoir transportées dans un autre Monde.</span></span> Serieusement, répris-je, ce ne seroit pas un plaisir mediocre de voir plusieurs Mondes differens.

Allons nous placer dans tous ces differens points de veuê, &amp; de là considerons l'Univers. N'avons-nous plus rien à voir dans la Lune? Je croy que non, répondis-je, du moins je vous y ay fait voir tout ce qui estoit de ma connoissance.

Cependant il faudroit concevoir que ces grands Corps auroient esté faits pour n'estre point habitez, que ce seroit là leur condition naturelle, &amp; qu'il y auroit une exception justement en faveur de la Terre toute seule.

A plus forte raison, ce me semble, une grosse Planete sera-t-elle un Monde habité. On a trouvé jusque dans des especes de pierres tres-dures de petits Vers sans nombre, qui y étoient logez de toutes parts dans des vuides insensibles, &amp; qui ne se nourrissoient que de la substance de ces pierres qu'ils rongeoient. Figurez-vous combien il y avoit de ces petits Vers, &amp; pendant combien d'années ils subsistoient de la grosseur d'un grain de sable; &amp; sur cet exemple, quand la Lune ne seroit qu'un amas de rochers, je la ferois plûtost ronger par ses Habitans que de n'y en pas mettre. Enfin tout est vivant, tout est animé : mettez toutes ces especes d'Animaux nouvellement découvertes, &amp; mesme toutes celles que l'on conçoit aisément qui sont encore à découvrir, avec celles que l'on a toûjours veuës, vous trouverez assurément que la Terre est bien peuplée, &amp; que la Nature y a si liberalement répandu les Animaux, qu'elle ne s'est pas mise en peine que l'on en vist seulement la moitié.

They know nothing of Storms and Tempest; which seem to us the effects of the wrath of Heaven. And can you think their condition is so much to be lamented? You, said I, Madam, represent the Moon as a most charming abode. Now methinks it should not be so desirous and agreeable to have a burning Sun always over ones Head, without the interposition of any Clouds to moderate its heat: And it may be for this Reason, Nature has sunk these Caverns in the Moon, which are big enough to be seen by our Telescopes: Who knows but the Inhabitants of the Moon, retire into these Cavities, when they are incommoded with the Excessive heat of the Sun, and it may be they live no where else, but build their Towns and Villages in these hollow places? And do not we know that Rome, which is built under ground, is almost as great as the City above ground? So that if we shou'd suppose, that the City of Rome above ground shou'd be ras'd, and quite remov'd, Rome under ground wou'd then be just such a Town, as those I have imagin'd to be in the Moon. Whole Nations live in these vast Caverns; and I doubt not but there may be Passages under ground, for the communication and commerce of one People and Nation with another. You are pleas'd to laugh, Madam, at my Fancy, do so with all my Heart, I agree you shou'd; and yet you may be more mistaken than I: For you believe, that the Inhabitants of the Moon dwell upon the Surface of their Globe, as we do on that of the Earth; it is very likely that 'tis just the contrary; for there is most certain, a vast difference between their way of living and ours. No matter, said the Marquiese, I cannot resolve to suffer the Inhabitants of the Moon to live in perpetual Darkness. You wou'd be harder put to it, Madam, said I, if you knew that a great Philosopher of old, believ'd the Moon to be the abode and dwelling of the Souls who had merited Happiness by their good Life in this World; and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction. At that rate, said she, we shou'd see the bless'd Souls come from the Moon to us; for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other? Seriously, said I, Madam, 'twould be a great Pleasure and Satisfaction to see several different Worlds; and I am often glad, to make these Journeys in Imagination; what joy then it wou'd be to do it in reality; that wou'd be far better than to travel from hence to Iapan, crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again. Well, said she, what hinders, but we shou'd make a Journey through the Planets as well as we can? Let us by imagination place our selves in several Positions, and situations, fit for considering the Universe. Have we no more to see in the Moon? No, said I, at least, I have shown you all I know. Going out of the Moon towards the Sun, the first Planet you meet with is Venus; and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis. Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">as the Moon does round the Earth</span></span>; and by the means of Telescopes, we discover that Venus waxes and wanes, being sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened according to her different Positions in respect to the Earth.</p> <p>P037: By all appearance the Moon is inhabited, why shou'd not Venus be so, as well as she? Ay, but interrupted the Marquiese by your why nots, you will people all the Planets. Do not doubt of it, Madam, answer'd I; why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all? We see that all the Planets are of the same Nature, that they are all Opaque solid Bodies, having no Light but what they receive from the Sun; which they send one to another by Reflection, and that they have all the same kind of motion; thus far equal, and after all this must we conceive that all these vast Bodies were made not to be inhabited? And that Nature has made only an exception in Favor of the Earth, he that will believe this, may, but for my part I cannot. I find you, said the Marquiese, very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited. It is true, Madam, in the minute wherein you have surpriz'd me, had you contradicted me, as to the Inhabitants of all the Planets, I wou'd not only have defended my opinion, but have proceeded, to have given you an exact description of all the several Inhabitants of the Planets. There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it. The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there. And it may be the different tastes of these Liquors, proceed from these little Animals, who bite, and sting our Tongues and Palates. If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,) and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures. Several Bodies, which appear to be solid, are nothing else but Collections or little heaps of these imperceptible Animals; who find there as much room, as is requisite for them to move in. The leaf of a Tree, is a little World inhabited, by such invisible little Worms: To them this leaf seems of a vast Extent, they find Hills and Valleys upon it: And there is no more Communication between the living Creatures on the one side, and those on the other, than between us and the Antipodes. And I think there is more reason, to believe a Planet (which is so vast a Body) to be inhabited. There has been found in several sorts of very hard Stones, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">infinite multitudes</span></span> of little Worms, lodg'd all over them in insensible varieties; and who are nourish'd upon the Substance of these Stones which they eat. Consider the vast Numbers of these little Animals, and how long a tract of Years they have liv'd upon a grain of Sand. And by this Argument, tho my Moon were nothing but a confus'd heap of Marble Rocks, I wou'd rather make it be devour'd and consum'd by its Inhabitants, than to place none at all in it.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P036: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">I do much regret that loss, said the Marquiese, for in my Opinion, the Inhabitants of the Moon are fully recompens'd for the want of the Rain-bow, day- break and twi-light, since for the same Reason, they have neither Thunder nor Lightning, both which are produc'd by Clouds and Exhalations; they enjoy bright serene Days, and never lose the Sun by Day, nor the Stars by Night.

These details and the explicit mention of 'commerce' are not present in the source and serve to make the scenario more vivid and logical for the reader.","Additional interpretive explanations are inserted: 'and that theit Felicity consisted in hearing the Harmony of the Spheres as they turn'd round, and that they were depriv'd of this heavenly Musick, as often as the Moon was obscur'd by the Shadow of the Earth; and that then these Souls roar'd and cry'd out as in despair, and that the Moon made haste to recover her Light again, to bring the Souls out of that Affliction.' The reference to 'Harmony of the Spheres' and extra narrative detail is added for the Anglophone audience unfamiliar with the myth.","Translator replaces a complex allusion with an explicit hypothetical: 'for why shou'd not the Earth be to the Moon, as the Moon is to the Earth, since according to the opinion of your Philosopher, there was no other Felicity for the Souls of the blessed, than to be transported from one World to the other?', crafting an analogy that is not in the original French, further clarifying the exchanged destiny of the blessed souls.","The phrase 'crawling as it were with difficulty from one point of this Globe to another, and still to see nothing but Men and Women over and over again' is an elaboration and normalization for English stylistic purposes, making the contrast with interplanetary travel sharper and more relatable.","The phrase 'and here I must again make use of my former Simile of Paris and St. Denis' does not exist in the source here (the source just mentions 'Saint Denis') and refers back to an earlier comparison to aid the English reader in following the argument.","The translation makes explicit two scientific mechanisms: 'Venus turns round the Sun on her own Axis, as the Moon does round the Earth; and by the means of Telescopes, we discover that Venus waxes and wanes, being sometimes altogether enlightned, and sometimes darkened according to her different Positions in respect to the Earth.' The clarification and didactic extension are normalization additions for naturalness and specificity.","The translation adds 'why has not Nature sufficient to give Inhabitants to 'em all?', a rhetorical question which is not present in the source and which introduces a generalized argument for planetary habitation to the English reader.","The translator chooses to rephrase and elaborate: 'very resolute and settled in your opinion of a sudden: A little while ago, you wou'd scarce allow the Moon to be inhabited; and seem'd to be very indifferent, whether it were so or not; whereas now, I am confident, you wou'd be very angry with any body that shou'd tell you that all the Planets were not inhabited.' This over-explanation of the emotional swing is not as explicit in the source.","The translation adds: 'There are certain Moments of believing things; and I never so firmly believ'd the Planets to be inhabited, as in that Moment I spoke of 'em; but now, after cooler Thoughts, I shou'd think it very strange, that the Earth shou'd be inhabited as it is; and the other Planets shou'd be so entirely desolate and desarted: For you must not think, that we see all the living Creatures that inhabit the Earth. For there are as many several species and kinds of Animals invisible, as there are visible. We see distinctly from the Elephant to the Mite; there our sight is bounded, and there are infinite numbers of living Creatures lesser than a Mite, to whom, a Mite is as big in proportion, as an Elephant is to it.' The reasoning about 'mite' and the proportionality explanation added to facilitate understanding for English readers unfamiliar with the term 'ciron'.","The phrase 'The late invention of Glasses call'd Microscopes, have discover'd thousands of small living Creatures, in certain Liquors, which we cou'd never have imagin'd to have been there.' is added for informational context—microscopes are named and the number of discoveries exaggerated and explained.","'If you mix certain ingredients in these Liquors, (as Pepper in Water,) and expose 'em to the heat of the Sun, or let 'em putrefie, you shall see other new species or living Creatures.' The translator adds the parenthetical example '(as Pepper in Water)' as a familiar illustration, whereas the original is more general and does not specify particulars."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P051: Ma raison est assez bien convaincuë, dit la Marquise, mais mon imagination est accablée de la multitude infinie des Habitans de toutes ces Planetes, &amp; embarrassée de la diversité qu'il faut établir entre eux; car je voy bien que la Nature, selon qu'elle est ennemie des repetitions, les aura tous faits différens, mais comment se representer cela?

The source only mentions reserving the sky and ruling there, not explicitly the stars or non-encroachment, nor an explicit notion of 'several Countries'. These additions clarify and elaborate the competition between princes and scholars for celestial naming as a matter of right and justice.","The translator expands the source's simple negotiation—allowing princes 'some Astre, ou quelque partie de la Lune'—to 'some Corner of the Moon, or some Star, to take their part in time of need', more fully representing the hypothetical, and personifying the conversation with 'said I, Madam, Will not you allow...'.","The translator adds explicative phrases such as 'they can be of no manner of use to 'em', 'as it were, a Scum arising from the Surface of the Sun', and 'they are dispers'd and dissipated', elaborating how the sunspots behave and their insignificance to the princes, which is not directly stated in the source.","The translator transforms the original's description, adding 'throws upon the Surface its Scum and Dross', whereas the French only mentions 'rejettées sur sa surface' (thrown to the surface) and no mention of 'dross'. This explains that the impurities take a particular form when ejected by the sun and does so in more concrete terms for the target audience.","The translator adds 'Pray, Madam, fansie to your self what strange Bodies these Spots of the Sun must be'—the French only addresses the reader, not the Marquise, and does not include the direct address. Additionally, 'full as big as the Globe of the Earth' rather than 'aussi grand que la Terre' and 'and of the Extent of this vast Ocean of Light and Fire, which we call the Sun' expands the original metaphor of 'la grande Mer de lumière & de feu'.","The translator adds 'at the same time they acknowledge that these Mountains may be altogether visionary, and that they are nothing else but the Effects of the Glasses of the Telescopes. To whom shall we trust then, when these very Glasses, to which we owe so many new Discoveries, deceive us?' In the French, the 'pure vision' is only attributed to 'quelque chose qui arrive dans les Lunettes', and the questioning of trust in the instruments is less explicitly stated, with less emphasis on the paradox and doubt about telescopes as a source of discoveries and deceptions.","The translation 'and yet 'tis pity, for the Situation wou'd be extreamly fine; its Inhabitants wou'd be plac'd in the Centre of the Universe, and wou'd see all the other Planets turn regularly round 'em, whereas we observe infinite Irregularities in their Course; and 'tis only because we are not in a proper Situation to consider 'em, as not being in the Centre of their Motion.

Il n'y a qu'un lieu dans le Monde, d'où l'étude des Astres puisse estre extremément facile, & justement dans ce lieu-là, il n'y a personne.' The translation elaborates the 'centre of the Universe', 'situation', and the thought that only from such a center could true observations be made, making the regret more explicit and spelling out the hypothetical benefits in more detail.","The target text adds 'You do not think, whilst you speak', 'were any living Creature in the Sun', and 'nor, indeed, any thing; the brightness of the Sun wou'd render all things else invisible', which is not as clearly stated in the French.

But, pray, Madam, allow me to tell you, that you who have corrected me so justly, may also be mistaken your self: The Inhabitants of the Sun wou'd not so much as see it self; for they wou'd be incapable to support the dazling of his Light, or unable to receive it, by being too near; and all things well consider'd, the Sun wou'd be a Country of blind Men only. So that, once for all, I conclude, the Sun cannot be inhabited; and if you please, Madam, we will continue our Journey to the other Worlds: We are now come to the Centre, which is the lowest Point in all Circular Figures; and therefore must return back again, and go upwards. In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited.</p> <p>P049: The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and his Inhabitants see the Sun neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or Guards: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us. But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun. Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain</span></span>, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; all that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">vast Ocean,</span></span> and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and the Sphere</span></span> of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">from East to West,</span></span> round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that: This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">the Sphere of its Activity</span></span> can reach; and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune. Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">in a Vessel</span></span>, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">like an Onion</span></span>; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors. The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P048: I confess, said I, I am mistaken, I consider'd only the Situation of the Sun, without the Effects of its Light. But, pray, Madam, allow me to tell you, that you who have corrected me so justly, may also be mistaken your self: The Inhabitants of the Sun wou'd not so much as see it self; for they wou'd be incapable to support the dazling of his Light, or unable to receive it, by being too near; and all things well consider'd, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"0\">the Sun wou'd be a Country of blind Men only</span></span>.

In the Way, we shall find Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and the Moon; all which Planets we have visited.</span></span> </p><p>P049: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">The next that presents it self to our Observation is Mars, who contains nothing rare or curious that I know of: His Days are not a full Hour longer than ours, but his Years are double the length of ours. Mars is less than the Earth, and his Inhabitants see the Sun neither so big, nor so bright as we do. In short, Mars is not worthy the pains of a longer Discourse; but 'tis very curious to observe Iupiter, and his four Moons, or Guards: they are four little Planets, which turn round Iupiter, as our Moon turns round us.</span></span> But, says the Marquiese, interrupting me, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">why are there some Planets attending upon others, who, it may be, are no better than themselves? In my Opinion, it wou'd be more regular and uniform if all the Planets, great and small, had but one Motion round the Sun.</span></span> Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur Des Cartes, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they will; I long to know what these Tourbillions are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no longer, but henceforth abandon all my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk what they please; but let me understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such Transports, said I, Madam; and I am sorry they have not a fitter Object: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">But to satisfie you, a Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; each little part being allow'd a particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not obstruct the general Circular Motion. As for Example; A Tourbillion of Air, call'd a Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain, is an infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round together, carrying along every thing they meet with in their way:</span></span> You know that the Planets are carry'd round in the Celestial Matter, which is incredibly subtile and swift; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">all that vast Ocean, and Mass of Celestial Substance, which is between the Sun, and the Sphere of the fixed Stars, turns round, and carries with it the Planets one way, from East to West, round the Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to observe thus; if the Earth were in the middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also turn round upon her own Axis, like that:</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"6\">This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, Governor; but at the same time, all the Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in imitation of that great one, the Sun; notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every one of them turns round upon his own Axis, and sweeps along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a Planet, which extends as far as the Sphere of its Activity can reach;</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"7\">and if it falls so out, that any lesser Planet than that which governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, with their Whirlings, to turn round with the great Tourbillion of the Sun.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"8\">'Twas thus that, after the Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its Obedience.</span></span> Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was happier or stronger than we; there fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 'em all four: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"9\">Our Earth, which is now a chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, you may easily believe he wou'd have forc'd us to have turn'd round him also, Iupiter being ninety times bigger than our Earth; and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, whereas now the Earth has a Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of Situation has decided our Fortune.</span></span> Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth shall always remain in the same Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, towards some Planet as dangerous as Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other stronger Planet may approach nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes bring 'em nearer together, and at other times remove 'em farther from one another. We might gain rather than lose by that Bargain, said I; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"10\">for it may be, our Earth wou'd be carry'd near Venus and Mercury, which are little Planets, and cou'd not resist ours</span></span>: But we have nothing either to hope or fear from such an Accident; the Planets must remain where they are, new Conquests are forbid them, as they were heretofore to the Kings of China. You know very well, when one mixes Oil and Water together in a Vessel, the Oil will swim above; and if you throw any very light thing into the Vessel, the Oil will support it, and it will not penetrate into the Water: Throw in any other thing, somewhat heavier, of a proportionable weight to penetrate the Oil, which is too weak to stop it; 'twill fall upon the Water, and swim, the Water being sufficiently strong to bear it up. So that this Vessel, full of two Liquors, which does not mingle together two Bodies of an unequal weight, rests naturally in two different Positions, the one above the other; so as the lightest can never descend, the heaviest can never ascend. If you add other Liquors that will not mingle together, and throw as many Bodies into 'em of proportionable weight, 'twill still be the same thing. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"11\">Imagine to your self, that the Celestial Substance which fills the vast Tourbillion, or Whirling of the Sun, is compos'd of different Coats, wrapp'd within one another, like an Onion; these Coats are of different weights and force, as Oil and Water, and other Liquors.</span></span> The Planets also are of different weights; and by consequence, every one of the Planets must stop upon that Coat proportionable to its weight, and which has necessary strength for supporting it, and keeping it in an equal Balance; and you will perceive it is not possible in Nature they can remove from thence.</p>","explanations":["The translator adds 'only' to emphasize the exclusivity (a country of blind men only) and to make the metaphor more natural and explicit for English readers.","The translator adds 'and therefore must return back again, and go upwards.

For Example; The Inhabitants of that Moon next to Iupiter, see him three hundred and sixty times bigger than our one Moon appeareth to us: And as I believe that little Moon to be much nearer to Iupiter than Ours is; so his greatness must be by that considerably augmented; and they must constantly see that monstrous Planet hanging over their Heads, at a very small distance.</span></span> And if it be true, that the Gauls of old, apprehended the falling of the Heavens: The Inhabitants of that Moon have more Reason to fear the falling of Iupiter. It may be, said she, they have that fright, instead of that of the Eclipses, which you told me, they are free from; and which must be supply'd by some other piece of Folly. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"1\">It must be so infallibly, said I, Madam,</span></span> for the great inventer of the third System, of which I spoke to you the other Day, the Ticho-Brahe one of the greatest Astronomers that ever liv'd, was far from fearing Eclipses as the Vulgar do; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">but instead of that, he fear'd, if the first he met (as he went out of his House in the Morning) were old, or if a Hare happen'd to cross his way, he instantly return'd home, shut himself up, and did believe that day to be unlucky; nor wou'd he dare to attempt Business of the smallest Consequence.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The translator has added several elements: the idea that the Moons are 'Colonies of Jupiter,' that they 'receive their Laws and Manners from thence, and pay Homage and Respect to Jupiter, and not to look upon that great Planet, but with Veneration.' Also, a hypothetical extension is included—sending ambassadors and swearing fealty to Jupiter, as well as a philosophical speculation about the relationship between the Inhabitants of Earth's Moon and those of Jupiter's Moons, which is not present in the source. These additions provide a satirical development and contextualize the imagined society of the moons for the English audience, making the idea of colonies and veneration more explicit.","The translator interpolates 'said I, Madam,' clarifying the speaker and addressing the Marquise, an addition aimed at making the dialogue clearer and more lively for the English reader.","The translator elaborates the anecdote about Tycho Brahe's superstition, specifying: 'if the first he met (as he went out of his House in the Morning) were old, or if a Hare happen'd to cross his way, he instantly return'd home, shut himself up, and did believe that day to be unlucky; nor wou'd he dare to attempt Business of the smallest Consequence.' The French original is more concise, so the English adds explicit reference to repeatedly returning home, shutting himself up, and avoiding even the 'smallest Consequence' of business, which expands the anecdote for illustrative effect."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P072: Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit-elle, aprés que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la crainte des Eclipses, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché.

The French only says 'c'est une marque qu'il faut des Lunes' (it's a sign that moons are needed); the translator makes it more explicit that the moons are necessary for Mars in particular, which adds clarity for the target audience.","The English version expands the discussion about exceptions and adds 'in the best Systems, there are always some things that agree exactly; but there are other things, that one must adjust as well as one can, or leave them as they are, if there be no hopes to overcome the difficulty: Let us do so if you please with Mars; and since he is not favourable to us, say no more of him.' The French is much briefer, merely giving an analogy and a suggestion to leave Mars aside; the English elaborates for clarity.","The target introduces 'And tell me if it wou'd not be strangely surprizing, if we were in the World of Saturn', which is not present as such in the French, giving more vivid context and addressing the interlocutor directly, increasing reader engagement and vividness.","The target adds the clarification in parentheses '(tho in the Humour I was in, I was enclin'd to put Inhabitants every where)' and also the phrase 'for they must have Inhabitants.' These are not directly present in the source and serve to elaborate the narrator's playful mood and make explicit the requirement to populate the moons.","The phrase 'turning one way, and that the five little Moons I spoke of, had only escaped out of this great Ring; what an Infinity of Worlds are there then in the Tourbillion or whirlings of Saturn? and yet whatever is the Cause, the Inhabitants of Saturn are miserable enough, notwithstanding the Assistance of this great Ring.' contains additions: 'turning one way', 'what an Infinity of Worlds', and 'whatever is the Cause...notwithstanding the Assistance...' The French simply speculates about moons and worlds in Saturn without these extended explanatory and causal phrases. The translation adds rhetorical questions and cause/effect for dramatic and explanatory effect.","The translation adds rhetorical questions: 'but what kind of Light?

The original is more terse and direct. The translation builds more context and color about Saturn's climate.","The English explicitly states 'There is a Necessity, said I, that the two Worlds that are at the extremity of this great Tourbillion, must be contrary one to another in every thing', whereas the French just says 'il faut bien...soient opposées en toutes choses.'

This translation specifies 'at least' and the nature of the questions ('most trifling'), and recharacterizes Cato as 'the grave Cato the Censor' rather than 'Caton d'Utique', and adds the phrase 'as too wild and youthful for their Conversation', which clarifies and explains the contrast further for the reader."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P082: Il me vient une pensée, dit-elle.

Leur lumiere, comme vous voyez, est assez vive &amp; assez éclatante. Si elles la recevoient du Soleil, il faudroit qu'elles la receussent déja bien foible aprés un trajet de cinquante millions de lieuës; il faudroit que par une reflexion qui l'affoibliroit encore beaucoup, elles nous la renvoyassent à cette mesme distance. Il seroit impossible qu'une lumiere qui auroit essuyé une reflexion, &amp; fait deux fois cinquante millions de lieuës, eust cette force et cette vivacité qu'a celle des Etoiles Fixes.

M'allez-vous dire: Les Etoiles Fixes sont autant de Soleils, nostre Soleil est le centre d'un Tourbillon qui tourne autour de luy, pourquoy chaque Etoile Fixe ne sera-t-elle pas aussi le centre d'un Tourbillon qui aura un mouvement autour d'elle? Nostre Soleil a des Planetes qu'il éclaire, pourquoy chaque Etoile Fixe n'en aura-t-elle pas aussi qu'elle éclairera?

Quoy, tout sera divisé en Tourbillons jettez confusément les uns parmi les autres? Chaque Etoile sera le centre d'un Tourbillon peut-estre aussi grand que celuy où nous sommes?

La Nature n'a rien épargné en le produisant, elle a fait une profusion des richesses qui est tout-à-fait digne d'elle. Rien n'est si beau à se representer que ce nombre prodigieux de Tourbillons, dont le milieu est occupé par un Soleil qui fait tourner des Planetes autour de luy. Les Habitans d'une Planete d'un de ces Tourbillons infinis voyent de tous costez les centres lumineux des Tourbuillons dont ils sont environnez, mais ils n'ont garde d'en voir les Planetes qui n'ayant qu'une lumiere foible, empruntée de leur Soleil, ne la poussent point au delà de leur Monde..</span></span> </p><p>P089: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">Vous m'offrez, dit-elle, une espece de Perspective si longue, que la veuë n'en peut attraper le bout.

Je vous avoüe qu'ils sont tout-à-fait dans l'enfoncement, &amp; que quelque effort que je fasse pour les voir, je ne les apperçois presque point. Et en effet ne sont-ils pas presque aneantis par l'expression dont vous estes obligé de vous servir en parlant d'eux? Il faut que vous les appeliez, les Habitans d'une des Planetes, de l'un de ces Tourbillons infinis? Nous mesmes, à qui la mesme expression convient, avoüez que vous ne sçauriez presque plus nous déméler au milieu de tant de Mondes. Pour moy, je commence à voir la Terre si effroyablement petite, que je ne croy pas avoir desormais d'empressement pour aucune chose. Asseurément, si on a tant d'ardeur de s'agrandir, si on fait desseins sur desseins, si on se donne tant de peine, c'est que l'on ne connoist pas les Tourbillons..

Without doubt, said I, Madam, our Sun is so near us, in respect of the Suns of the other Tourbillions, that his Light must have infinitely greater force upon our Sight than the Light of the other Suns; when we see our Sun, we see nothing else, his brightness makes all other things disappear: In another great Tourbillion, where another Sun governs, he in his turn removes and darkens our Sun, which does not appear, but in the Night as a fix'd Star amongst the other strange Suns (that is) fix'd Stars, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">and our Sun appears to the Inhabitants of that Tourbillion in the great Vault of the Heavens, as a Star of some Constellation, such as the Bear or the Bull:</span></span> As to the Planets which turn round about him (as our Earth for example) since they cannot see it at so great a distance, they do not so much as think of it, so that all these Suns are Suns by day for the Tourbillion which they govern, and fix'd Stars by Night; for all the other, every one of them is the only one of his kind in his own World; but serve only to make up the Number of fix'd Stars for all the other Worlds. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"5\">Notwithstanding, said she, of this Equality of Resemblance of the Worlds, yet I cannot believe, but they differ in a thousand things, for likeness upon the main does not hinder infinite little differences.</span></span></p>","explanations":["The translator specifies 'The Lover and Philosopher' to clarify who the 'two sorts of men' are, whereas the French uses a more ambiguous phrasing 'ces deux sortes de Gens-là'.

This is added to clarify the logic underlying the analogy for readers unfamiliar with the implied reasoning.","The phrase 'and therefore, I conclude they are Suns, and have Planets turning round about 'em; and every thing else we attribute to our Suns' expands on the French 'je leur attribuë tout ce qu'il a'.

Il vaut mieux pour luy, répondis-je, qu'il ne sorte point de nostre Tourbillon. Je vous ay dit le choc qui se fait à l'endroit où deux Tourbillons se poussent &amp; se repoussent l'un l'autre; je croy que dans ce pas là une pauvre Planete est agitée assez rudement, &amp; que ses habitans ne s'en portent pas mieux. Nous croyons nous autres estre bien malheureux quand il nous paroist une Comete; c'est la Comete elle-même qui est bien malheureuse. Je ne le crois point, dit la Marquise, elle nous apporte tous ses habitans en bonne santé. Rien n'est si divertissant que de changer ainsi de Tourbillon. Nous qui ne sortons jamais du nostre, nous menons une vie assez ennuyeuse. Si les habitans d'une Comete ont assez d'esprit pour prévoir le temps de leur passage dans nostre Monde, ceux qui ont déja fait le voyage, annoncent aux autres par avance ce qu'ils y verront. Vous découvrirez bien-tost une Planete qui a un grand Anneau autour d'elle, disent-ils peut-estre, en parlant de Saturne. Vous en verrez une autre qui en a quatre petites qui la suivent.

Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent? Oüi, sans doute, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumiere; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; car que faire sans Soleil? Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? Je vous diray si vous voulez, répondis-je, ce que disent de fort habiles gens, que les Etoiles fixes qui ont disparu ne se sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est à dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mesmes, tantost ils nous presentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantost la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoistre, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons-nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mesmes? Vous estes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en vostre faveur. Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantost plus grandes, tantost plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus legers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur, il y a des Etoiles fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroistre &amp; disparoistre, &amp; enfin disparoissent entierement, des demi Soleils reparoîtroient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoistroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoistre de longtemps. Prenez vostre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'estre visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en luy-mesme une source de lumiere? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, répondis-je, nostre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des broüillards, ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces taches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toujours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée belle, dit-on. Le Soleil a esté tres-pasle pendant des années entieres, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'estoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire, la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa; mais si elle eust continué, nous estions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je sçay les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pasle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris-je: Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changemens: soit lents, soit prompts, mais toujours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. Les Anciens estoient plaisans de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoyent pas encore vû changer. Avoyent-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'experience? Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de n<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"3\">ous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se laissoient des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"</span></span>semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"2\">celles qui les devoyent suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela elles diroient, nous avons toûjours vû le mesme Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours esté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas.</span></span> Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroistroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir nostre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque-autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses mêmes qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attens bien que s'il disparoist des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroist de nouvelles, il faut que l'espece se repare. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text UP\" data-index=\"4\">Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir esté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démeslez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je croy aisément que tout cela peut estre, mais je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir esté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux. Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir esté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différens, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondemens d'un nouveau Monde?</span></span> J'ay d'autant plus d'inclination à croire ces nouvelles productions, qu'elles répondent mieux à la haute idée que j'ay des ouvrages de la Nature.

Mettez-y encore des Mondes, n'y en mettez pas, cela dépend de vous.

Madam, reply'd I, we agree with the Turks also in one thing more; that is (as they) so we receive Ambassadors, but send none; for none of our Planets ever go to visit other Worlds. At this rate, said the Marquiese, we are very proud, yet I know not what to think of the matter; these Stranger- Planets, with their long Tails and Beards, have usually but a scurvy threatning Look, and it may be they are sent to terrifie us; whereas ours, not being made of that terrible Form, wou'd not be so proper to frighten People, were they sent into another World. These Tails and Beards, said I, are not real, but only Appearance, and these Stranger-Planets differ in nothing from ours; but entring into our Tourbillion, they take a Tail, or a Beard from a certain kind of Illumination which they receive from the Sun; which, as yet, is not fully explain'd amongst us. But let this be found out when it can, we now are sure it is nothing but a kind of Illumination, or <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">false </span></span> Light. I wish then, said the Marquiese, that our Saturn wou'd take a Tail, or a Beard, and go into some other Tourbillion, to frighten its Inhabitants; and that afterwards, laying aside this terrible Equipage, he wou'd return, with the rest of our Planets, to his own place. 'Twill be better for him, said I, not to go out of our Tourbillion: I have told you already of the Encounter between two Tourbillions pushing against one another; and I believe, upon that occasion, a poor Planet is strangely shaken, and that his Inhabitants are not the better for it. We believe our selves very miserable when we see a Comet appear, but it is the Comet it self that is most unhappy. I do not believe that, said the Marquiese, for it brings its Inhabitants to us in good health; and you know, nothing is wholsomer than Change of Air: As for us that never go out of our own, Life languishes but dully on. If the Inhabitants of a Comet had but the Skill to fore-see their Passage into our World, those who have already made that Voyage will tell these new Adventures what they will see in their way: A Planet, say they, which has a great Ring round him, meaning Saturn; and then you will see another that has four little ones following him, and it may be that amongst them there are People set a-part, on purpose for observing the very Minute when they shou'd enter into our World, and who are instantly to cry out, A new Sun! A new Sun! as our Mariners do, Land! Land! <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">after a long Sea-Voyage </span></span>. I hope you will no longer pity the Inhabitants of a Comet; but, no doubt, you will commiserate those who live in a Tourbillion where the Sun comes to be extinct, and leaves them in Eternal Night. What! cry'd out Madam the Marquiese, Can Suns be extinguish'd? Yes, said I, without dispute. The Ancients have seen fixed Stars in the Firmament, which we see no more; these Suns have lost their Light: A great Desolation certainly for that Tourbillion, and a great Mortality for all the Inhabitants of its Planets; for there is no living without a Sun. That Idea, said she, is too mournful; Is there no way to pass it by? If you please, said I, Madam, I'll tell you what very learned Men say; that the fixed Stars which have disappeared are not however extinguished, but that they are Half-Suns; that is to say, they have one side obscure, and the other englightned; and as they turn upon their own Axis, sometimes they present their enlightned half, and then we see 'em; and sometimes their obscure half, and then we lose 'em. To oblige you, Madam, I shall follow this Opinion, because 'tis more favourable than the other; but it must only be for certain Stars, who have regular Seasons of appearing and disappearing, as hath been discover'd; otherwise these Half-Suns cannot subsist. But what shall we say of Stars that disappear, and do not shew themselves again after the time in which they ought certainly to have perform'd the Revolution upon their own Axis? You are too just, Madam, to oblige me to believe that these Stars are Half-Suns: However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to solve this Objection another way: Those Suns shall not be extinguish'd then, but shall only be sunk into the depth of the vast Heavens, which removes 'em from our sight; and in that Case, these Suns are follow'd by their Tourbillions, and all is well. 'Tis true, that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have no such Motion as carry them from us; if they had, they might as well approach more near us, and we shou'd see 'em sometimes bigger, sometimes less; which can never fall out: Let us therefore suppose that there are some little Tourbillions of less Light and Activity, which slide in among the others, and make certain Turnings; after which, they come back again, whilst in the mean time the great Tourbillions remain where they did before; and 'tis a strange Misfortune that there shou'd be certain fixed Stars which appear to us, and after a great deal of time of appearing and dis-appearing, entirely vanish, and are lost. In that time the Half- Suns, I spoke of, wou'd appear again, and Suns that were sunk into the Heavens wou'd dis-appear once, and not to appear again for a long time. Resolve well what to think, Madam, and take Courage; there is a necessity that these Stars must be Suns, which grown obscure enough to be invisible to our sight, are afterwards enlightned, and in the end must lie extinguished. How! said the Marquiese; Can a Sun be obscur'd, or entirely extinguish'd, who is himself the Fountain of Light? The most easily in the World, said I, Madam: According to the Opinion of Des Cartes, our Sun has Spots; let 'em be Scum or Vapours, or what else you will, these Spots may condense, and many of 'em may come together, and form a kind of Crust, which may afterwards augment, and then farewell the Sun <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">and all its Light </span></span>. 'Tis said, we escap'd once very hardly, for the Sun was grown extreamly pale for several Years together; and particularly the Year after the Death of Iulius Caesar, it was that Crust that began to gather, and the Face of the Sun brake and dissipated it; but had it continu'd, we had been all undone. You make me tremble, said the Marquiese; and now that I understand the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I shall henceforth every Morning, instead of going to my Looking-Glass to consult my own Face, go and look up to the Heavens to consider that of the Sun. Madam, said I, be assur'd there goes a great deal of time to ruin a World. Then, said she, there is nothing requisite but Time. I acknowledge it, Madam, said I; all this vast Mass of Matter which composes the Universe, is in perpetual Motion, from which no part of it is entirely exempt; and therefore Changes must come sooner or later, but always in Time proportional to the Effect. The Ancients were foolish to imagine, that the Celestial Bodies were of an unchangeable Nature, because they never saw any Change in 'em; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text UP\">but they had neither Leisure nor Life long enough to undeceive themselves by Experience </span></span>; but the Ancients were young in respect of us. Suppose now, Madam, that the Roses, which last but for a Day, shou'd write Histories, and leave Memorials from one to another; the first wou'd have described the Picture of their Gardener of a certain manner; and after fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, the others that had follow'd 'em wou'd have alter'd nothing in that Description of the Gardener, but wou'd have said, We have always seen the same Gardener, since the Memory of Roses we have seen but him, he has always been as he is, he dies not as we do; nay, he changes not, and certainly will never be other than what he is: Wou'd this way of arguing of the Roses be good? Yet it wou'd be better grounded than that of the Ancients, concerning Celestial Bodies; and tho' there had never happen'd any Change in the Heavens to this Day, and tho' they shou'd seem to last for ever, yet I wou'd not believe it, but wou'd wait for a longer Experience; nor ought we to measure the Duration of any thing by that of our own scanty Life. Suppose a thing had a Being a hundred thousand times longer than ours, shou'd we therefore conclude it shou'd last for ever? Eternity is not so easy a matter; and some things must have pass'd many Ages of Men, one after another, before any sign of Decay had appeared in 'em. I am not so unreasonable, said the Marquiese, as to consider the Worlds as things eternal, nor will I do them the honour to compare 'em to your Gardener, who liv'd so many Ages longer than the Roses: They are themselves but as a Rose, which are produc'd but in a Garden, that bud one Day, and fall the next; and as those Roses die, new ones succeed; so for some ancient Stars that dis- appear, other new ones are born in their places, and that Defect in Nature must be so repair'd, and no Species can totally perish. Some will tell you, they are Suns, which draw near to us after having been long lost in the depth of Heaven: Others will say, they are Suns that have cast off the Crust which began to cover them. If I cou'd easily believe all this, yet I shou'd believe also that the Universe was made in such a manner, that new Suns have been, and may be form'd in it from time to time; and what shou'd hinder the Substance proper to make Suns from gathering together, and producing new Worlds? And I am the more inclin'd to believe these new Productions, since they are more correspondent to the great Idea I have of the glorious Works of Nature: And why shou'd not she who knows the Secret to bring forth and destroy Herbs, Plants and Flowers, in a continu'd Succession, practise also the same Secret on the Worlds, since one costs her no more Pains and Expence than the other. Indeed, says the Marquiese, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies so subject to change, that I am altogether returned to my self. Let us return yet more, said I, and if you please, make this subject no longer, that of our Discourse; besides you are arriv'd at the utmost bounds of Heaven; and to tell you, that there are any Stars beyond that, were to make my self a wiser Man than I am, place Worlds there, or place none there, it depends upon your Will. These vast invisible Regions, are properly the Empires of Philosophers, which it may be are or are not, as they themselves shall fansie.
