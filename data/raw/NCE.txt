2   3            [Page 18] [] avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière <RW> de Physique
2    3             </RW>, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que <NCE> la Terre pouvoit être 
2    3            une Planète </NCE>; & les Planètes autant de Terres, & toutes les Etoiles des mondes. J'en revenois 
2    3            toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles comme toutes personnes
2    3            raisonnable auroient fait en notre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée 
2    3            générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je [Page 19] me jettay.

2    3            [Page 5] [] [W]ith such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to 
2    3            go far about to make her apprehend that <NCE> the Earth might be a Planet </NCE>, and every 
2    3           Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable
2    3            person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, 
2    3            I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our 
2    3           Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern 
2    3           whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, 
2    3           <NCE> you would not care two pence </NCE> to know whether they were so or not: but we are 
2    3            willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. [].

2    4            [Page 6] [] to a Person who understood nothing of <RW> Natural Philosophy </RW> [Page  7] you
2    4            must go a great way about to prove that <NCE> the Earth may be a Planet </NCE>, the Planets so 
2    4            many Earths, and all the Stars worlds; however to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I at last 
2    4            resolv'd on this Method. All Philosophy, said I, Madam, is founded upon two things, either that we 
2    4           are too short sighted, or that we are too curious; for if our eyes were better than they are, we should 
2    4           soon see whether the Stars were worlds or not; and if on the other side we were less curious, 
2    4            <IIM> we should not care </IIM> whether the Stars are Worlds or not, which I think 
2    4            is much to the same purpose. But the business is, we have a mind to know more than 
2    4            we see [].

2    6           [Page 8] for to prove to her (who understood nothing of Natural Philosophy) that 
2    6           <NCE>the Earth was a Planet</NCE>, and all the other Planets so many Earths,
2   6     and all the Stars Worlds, it was necessary for the explaining my self, to bring my Arguments a 
2     6           great way off; and therefore I still endeavoured to perswade her that 'twas much better 
2     6           to pass the time in another manner of Conversation, which the most reasonable People in our 
2     6           Circumstances would do; but I pleaded to no Purpose, and at last to satisfie her, and give her a
2     6           general Idea of Philosophy, I made use of this way of arguing.
