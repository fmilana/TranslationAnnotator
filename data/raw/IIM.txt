4    4            [Page 19] Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est 
fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a 
4    4            l'esprit curieux & les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez 
les yeux meilleurs, que vous ne les avez, 
4    4            vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les 
Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des 
4    4            Mondes: & si d'un autre côté vous étiez moins curieuse, 
vous ne vous soucieriez pas 
4    4            de le savoir, ce qui reviendrait au même. Mais on veut 
savoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est là la 
4    4            difficulté. [Page 20] Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le 
voyait bien, ce serait toujours autant de 
4    4            connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. 
Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie 
4    4            à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, & à tâcher de 
deviner ce qu'ils ne voient point, & cette 
4    4            condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. [].

4    3            [Page 5] [] All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on 
these two 
4    3            things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness 
of our Sight: 
4    3            For if you could see better than you do, you would 
discern whether 
4    3            those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other 
hand, if you
4    3            were less curious, <NCE> you would not care two pence 
</NCE> to know 
4    3            whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know 
more than we 
4    3            can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could 
rightly
4    3            discern what we see, we might be said to be so far 
knowing; but the 
4    3            mischief is, we see things otherways than they really 
are; so that
4    3            true Philosophers spend their days in not believing 
what they see, 
4    3            and in studying to divine of what they see not, a 
condition, in my
4    3            opinion, not much to be envyed [].

4    4            <P004>
4    4            [Page 7] [] All Philosophy, said I, Madam, is founded 
upon two things, <IIM>either 
4    4            that we are too short sighted, or </IIM> that we are 
too curious; for if our eyes were 
4    4            better than they are, we should soon see whether the 
Stars were worlds or 
4    4            not; and if on the other side we were less curious, 
<IIM> we should not 
4    4            care </IIM> whether the Stars are Worlds or not, which 
I think is much to 
4    4            the same purpose. But the business is, we have a mind 
to know more than 
4    4            we see: And again, if we could discern well what we do 
see, it would be 
4    4            so much known to us: But we see things quite otherwise 
than they are. So 
4    4            that your true Philosopher will not believe what he 
doth see, and is 
4    4            alwaies conjecturing at what he doth not, which is a 
Life I think not 
4    4            much to be envy'd [].

4    7            [Page 8] [] All Philosophy is grounded on two 
Principles, that of a 
4    7            passionate thirst of knowledge of the 
4    7            Mind, and the weakness of the Organs of the Body; <IIM> 
for if the 
4    7            Eye-sight were in perfection, you could 
4    7            as easily discern there were Worlds in the Stars, as 
that there 
4    7            are Stars </IIM>: On the other hand, if you 
4    7            were less curious [Page 9] and desirous of knowledge, 
you would 
4    7            be indifferent, whether it were so 
4    7            or not, which indeed comes all to the same purpose; but 
we would 
4    7            gladly know more than we see, 
4    7            and there's the difficulty: for if we could see well 
and truly 
4    7            what we see, we should know enough; 
4    7            but we see most Objects quite otherwise than they are; 
so that 
4    7            the true Philosophers spend their 
4    7            time in not believing what they see, and in endeavouring to 
4    7            guess at the knowledge of what they see 
4    7            not; and in my Opinion this kind of life is not much to be 
4    7            envied;

paroît guère portative. Et croiriez-vous,

said I, if you did not know it by 
10    8            experience, that a great Ship mounted with an hundred 
and fifty pieces of Artilery, man'd 
10    8            with above three thousand men, and well laden with 
Merchandise, would be a thing easily
10    8            portative? in the mean time a little puff of Wind 
suffices to drive it upon the Water; because
10    8            the Water being liquid, is easily divided, and makes 
no resistance to the motion of the Ship; 
10    8            so the Earth, though an unwieldy mass, is easily 
carried through the celestial matter, which
10    8            is ten thousand times more fluid than Water, and fills 
all that vast space where the Planets 
10    8            swim. And where is it necessary that the Earth should 
be riveted to resist the motion of that 
10    8            Celestial matter? 'Tis as if a little Boul of Wood 
could be able not to follow the Current of a

10    7            [Page 26] [] [S]aid I, had you rather 
10    7            that the Sun and all the Stars, which are vast great 
Bodies, should in 
10    7            twenty four hours travel such an infinity of Miles, 
and make so 
10    7            prodigious a Tour as they needs must, if the Earth did 
not turn round it 
10    7            self every twenty four hours? Oh, said she, the Sun 
and [Page  27] the 
10    7            Stars are all Fire, their Motion is not very 
difficult; but the Earth, I 
10    7            fancy, is a little unweildy: That signifies nothing, I 
reply'd, for what 
10    7            do you think of a first rate Ship, which carries near 
a hundred Guns, 
10    7            and a thousand Men, beside her Provisions and other 
Furniture? you see 
10    7            one puff of Wind makes it sail on the Water, because 
the Water is liquid, 
10    7            and being easily separated doth very little resist the 
motion of the 
10    7            Ship: So the Earth tho' never so Massive is as easily 
born up by the 
10    7            Celestial Matter, which is a thousand times more fluid 
than the Water, 
10    7            and fills all that great Space where the Planets 
float; for where would 
10    7            you the Earth should be fastned to resist the motion

10    12            [Page 31] [] But, Madam, said I, wou'd you rather, 
that the Sun, and the 
10    12            Stars (which are generally far greater 
10    12            Bodies) shou'd make a vast Circumference round the 
Earth in a 
10    12            Day, and run an infinite number of 
10    12            Leagues in twenty four Hours time? Which they must of 
necessity 
10    12            do, if the Earth have not that 
10    12            Diurnal Motion on its own Axis. Oh! answered she, the 
Sun and 
10    12            Stars are all Fire, swiftness of Motion 
10    12            is easie to them; but for the Earth, that does not 
seem to be 
10    12            very portable. And wou'd you believe it, 
10    12            said I, Madam, if you had never seen the Experiment, 
that a 
10    12            First-Rate Ship, of <IIM> a hundred and twenty Guns, 
with fifteen hundred Men </IIM>, 
10    12            and proportionable Provision, with all her Ammunition 
and Tackle a-board, 
10    12            were a very portable thing? Notwithstanding, a gentle 
Breeze will 
10    12            move this Ship on the Sea, because the Water is 
liquid, and 
10    12            yielding easily, makes no resistance to 
10    12            the motion of the Vessel: So the Earth, [Page 32] 
10    12            notwithstanding of as vast bulk and weight, is 
10    12            easily mov'd in the Celestial Matter, which is a 
thousand times 
10    12            more fluid than the Water of the Sea; 
10    12            and which fills all that vast Extent, where the 
Planets swim, as 
10    12            it were: And to what wou'd you fix or 
10    12            grapple the Earth, to hinder it from being carry'd 
along with 
10    12            the Current of this Celestial Matter or 
10    12            Substance? It wou'd be just as if a little wooden 
Ball shou'd 
10    12            not follow the Current of a rapid River.

us, up to the Ears 
14    8            in Politicks, yet settling their Nation no better than 
we do the World in

Iroquois going to 
14    8            eat a Prisoner for their Breakfast, who seems as

14    8            their Lips and Eye-brows blue, only to please the

14    8            and grant all to the first Comer, except a [Page  31] 
little they reserve 
14    8            for their Husbands; then the Tartars going to steal

14    14            English, discoursing, it may be, upon some politick 
Design, with 
14    14            more Gravity, but less Pleasure, than 
14    14            we talk [Page 35] of our Philosophy: Next will come a 
vast 
14    14            Ocean, in which there will be sailing 
14    14            some Ships, perhaps not so much at their Ease as we 
are: Then 
14    14            will appear the <IIM> Canibals </IIM>,
14    14             eating some Prisoners of War alive, they seeming 
very 
14    14            unconcern'd at what they suffer: After 
14    14            them, the Women of the Country of Iesso, who spend 
all their 
14    14            time in preparing their Husbands 
14    14            Meals, and in painting their Lips and Eye-brows with

14    14            please the ugliest Fellows in the World: 
14    14            Next will succeed the Tartars, who go, with great 
Devotion, on 
14    14            Pilgrimage to that great Priest, who 
14    14            never comes out of an obscure place, where he has no 
other Light 
14    14            but Lamps, by which they adore 
14    14            him: After them, the beautiful Circassian Women, who 
make no 
14    14            difficulty of granting any Favour to 
14    14            the first Comer, except what they essential know does 
belong to 
14    14            their Husbands: Then the Crim, or 
14    14            Little Tartars, who live by stealing of Wives for the 
Turks and 
14    14            Persians: And at last, our selves again, perhaps 
talking as we do now.

77    59            	If there are sixteen Planets, says she, Saturn 
must have five 
77    59            Moons. 'Tis very true, said I, and two of these five, 
are but lately 
77    59            discover'd; but there is somewhat that is more 
remarkable, since his Year 
77    59            is thirty of ours, there are consequently in him some 
Countreys, where 
77    59            their Night is fifteen years long; and what can you 
imagine Nature hath 
77    59            invented to give light, during so dreadful a Night? 
Why, she hath not 
77    59            only given Saturn five Moons, but she hath 
encompass'd him round with a 
77    59            great Circle or Ring, the which being plac'd beyond 
the reach of the 
77    59            shadow which the Body of that Planet casts, reflects 
the light of the Sun 
77    59            continually on those places [Page  118] where they 
cannot see the Sun at 
77    59            all.

77    57            	I see, answer'd she, by the number of sixteen 
Planets, that 
77    57            Saturn must have five Moons. He 
77    57            has so, said I, Madam, and two of the five are 
discover'd very 
77    57            lately, but there is yet something more 
77    57            remarkable in that Planet; for his Year is as long as 
thirty of 
77    57            ours; and consequently there are <IIM> 
77    57            Climates in that World</IIM> where one Night lasts 
for fifteen 
77    57            Years together. Can you guess what Nature has 
intended for the 
77    57            enlightning of Nights so long and 
77    57            dreadful? She was not satisfied to bestow on Saturn 
five Moons; 
77    57            but has also given him a great Circle 
77    57            or Ring, which environs him entirely, and which is 
elevated 
77    57            sufficiently high enough to be out of the 
77    57            shadow of this Planet. It reflects the Light of the 
Sun 
77    57            perpetually upon the <RW> Inhabitants of 
77    57            Saturn, who have the Misfortune to live in that 
Climate </RW>, 
77    57            that is, so long a time depriv'd of the 
77    57            influence of his Beams.

81    59            [Page 128] [] You give me an Idea of Saturn, said 
the 
81    59            Marquiese; that makes me shiver with cold; whereas 
before you 
81    59            warm'd me as much with the 
81    59            descriptions you gave me of Mercury. There is a 
Necessity, said 
81    59            I, that the two Worlds that are at the 
81    59            extremity of this great Tourbillion, must be contrary 
[Page 128] 
81    59            one to another in every thing. At 
81    59            that rate, said she, the Inhabitants of Saturn must 
be very 
81    59            wise; for you told me the Inhabitants of 
81    59            Mercury were down-right mad. If the People of Saturn, 
said I, be 
81    59            not wise, they are at least in all 
81    59            Appearance so, and are very flegmatick, they know not 
what it is 
81    59            to laugh; and who take a whole 
81    59            days time at least, to answer the most trifling 
Question: They 
81    59            wou'd have look'd upon the grave <IIM> Cato

86    79            The  distance of the Sun from the most distant

from the fixed 
86    79            Stars, men do not take the pains to compute it. Their 
Light, as you 
86    79            see, is bright and lively enough. If they receive it 
from the Sun, 
86    79            they must needs receive it in a weak condition after 
a passage of 
86    79            fifty millions of Leagues, and they must return it to 
us through the 
86    79            same distance by a Reflection, that must yet much 
more impair the 
86    79            strength of it. It may seem impossible that a Light 
that is made by 
86    79            Reflection, and has travail'd twice fifty millions of 
Leagues, should 
86    79            retain that force and vivacity which we find in the 
fixed Stars. You 
86    79            see then they are all luminous in themselves, and in 
a word, are so

light [Page  125] 
86    67            is bright and shining, and did they receive it from 
the Sun, it must 
86    67            needs be very weak after a passage of <NCE> fifty

86    67            </NCE>; then judge how much it is wasted by

86    62            Astronomers make the distance yet greater; that 
between the Sun 
86    62            and the remotest Planet is 
86    62            nothing if compared to the distance between the Sun

86    62            and the fix'd Stars; we do not trouble 
86    62            our selves to number 'em, their Lustre as you see is 
both clear 
86    62            and bright. If the fix'd Stars, receive 
86    62            their Light from the Sun, it must certainly be very 
weak and 
86    62            faint before it comes to 'em, having 
86    62            passed through a <IIM> hundred and fifty Millions of 
Miles 
86    62            </IIM> of the Celestial Substance, I spoke 
86    62            of before: Then consider, the fix'd Stars are 
oblig'd, to 
86    62            reflect this borrow'd Light upon us at the same 
86    62            distance, which [Page 132> in reason must make that 
Light yet 
86    62            paler and more faint, it is impossible 
86    62            that this Light if it were borrow'd from the Sun, and 
not only 
86    62            suffer'd a Reflection, but pass'd through 
86    62            twice the distance of a <IIM> hundred and fifty 
Millions </IIM> 
86    62            of Miles, cou'd have that Force and 
86    62            Vivacity, that we observe in the fix'd Stars: 
Therefore I 
86    62            conclude they are enlightned of themselves; 
86    62            and are by consequence so many Suns.

cinq ou six , & <IIM> j'en voy d'icy 
93    93             des milliers </IIM> ?

  [What you say is only enough for   five or six, & <IIM>I see thousands 
of them from here</IIM>?]

93    88            [Page 75] [] That's not much, says she, for the 
Quantity of Worlds; what you 
93    88            say is not enough for above five or six, and I see 
here <IIM> a 
93    88            million [delle migliaia ]</IIM>.

93    73            <P073>
93    73            [Page 134] [] It is not so much, reply'd the 
Countess, considering 
93    73            what a 
93    73            multitude of Worlds there are; what you have said is 
sufficient but for 
93    73            five or six, and <UP> from hence I see thousands 
</UP>.

93    65            <P065>
93    65            [Page 140] [] No, said she, not for the quantity of 
Worlds which you say 
93    65            there is: What you have describ'd 
93    65            will suffice but for five or six, and I see 
thousands.

101    101            [Page 334] [] J'entends , dit-elle. Nous ne leur 
laissons pas d'entrer 
101    101             jusque dans le cur de nôtre Tourbillon , & avec 
nos Planetes , nous les recevons comme 
101    101            le Grand Seigneur reçoit les Ambassadeurs qu'on luy 
envoye. Il ne leur [Page 335] fait pas 
101    101            l'honneur de les loger à Constantinople , mais 
seulement dans un Fauxbourg de la Ville. 
101    101            <IIM> Nous avons encore cela de commun avec les 
Ottomans </IIM> , repris-je , qu'ils 
101    101            reçoivent des Ambassadeurs sans en renvoyer , & que 
nous ne renvoyons point 
101    101            de nos Planetes aux Mondes voisins. []

101    99            <P099>
101    99            [Page 80] [] I understand you well, said she, we 
suffer them not to enter 
101    99            into the heart of our Vortex, and with our own 
Planets; but we 
101    99            receive them as the Grand Seignior, receives 
Embassadours; He doth 
101    99            not honour them with Lodgings in Constantinople, but 
only in the 
101    99            Suburbs of the Town.
101    99            </P099>
101   100           <P100>We have this likewise, said I, in common with 
the Ottomans, that 
101   100           as they receive Embassadours, but send none; so we 
send none of our 
101   100           Planets to the neighbouring Worlds.

101    80            [Page 142] [] I understand you, says she, <UP> we 
do not suffer them to come </UP> 
101    80            into the heart of our Vortex, among our own Planets, 
but we receive them 
101    80            as the Grand Signior doth the Embassadours that are 
sent to him; he will not 
101    80            shew them so much respect as to let 'em Lodge in 
Constantinople, but 
101    80            Quarters 'em in one of the Suburbs of the City: 
Madam, said I, 
101    80            [Page  143] we, and the Ottomans agree likewise in 
this, that as they 
101    80            receive Embassadours, but never send any, so we 
never send any of our 
101    80            Planets into the Worlds that are next us. [].

101    74             [Page 148] [] I understand you, said she, <UP> and 
am pleas'd with your Chamber of 
101    74             State for we do not permit 'em to come directly in 
the middle of our Tourbillion, but
101    74             receive 'em as the Grand Seignior does his <IIM> 
Foreign Ministers </IIM>; he does 'em 
101    74             not the Honour to lodge 'em in Constantinople, but 
sends 'em to the Suburbs. Madam,
101    74             reply'd I, <IIM>we agree with the Turks also in one 
thing more </IIM>; that is (as they) 
101    74             so we [Page 149] receive Ambassadors, but send 
none; for none of our Planets ever go 
101    74             to visit other Worlds. []
