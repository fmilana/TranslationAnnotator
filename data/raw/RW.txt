3    3            [Page 18] [] J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. Je luy fis 
3    3            du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, & 
3    3            quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, & que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne  [Page 
3    3            18] savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, <RW> qui ne 
3    3            savoit rien en matière de Physique </RW>, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, 
3    3            pour luy prouver que <NCE> la Terre pouvoit être une Planète </NCE>; & les Planètes autant 
3    3            de Terres, & toutes les Etoiles des mondes. []

3    3            [Page 4] [] I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was [Page  5] 
3    3            forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation 
3    3            sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far 
3    3            ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not 
3    3            whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew 
3    3            nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to 
3    3            make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a 
3    3            World.

3    4            [Page 6] [] But in vain I excus'd my self, who could resist so many Charms? I 
3    4            was forc'd to yield, and yet I knew not where to begin; for to a Person 
3    4            who understood nothing of <RW> Natural Philosophy </RW> [Page  7] you 
3    4            must go a great way about to prove that the Earth may be a Planet, the 
3    4            Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars worlds; however to give her a 
3    4            general Notion of Philosophy, I at last resolv'd on this Method.

3    6            [Page 7] []  But 'twas in vain to put her off by Excuses, from a Novelty she was already but 
3    6             too much prepossest with: There was a necessity of yielding, and all I could do was to
3    6             prevail with her to be secret, for the saving my Honour; but when I found my self engaged 
3    6             past retreat, and had a design to speak, I knew not where to begin my discourse, [Page 8]
3    6             for to prove to her <RW> (who understood nothing of Natural Philosophy) </RW> that 
3    6             <NCE>the Earth was a Planet</NCE>, and all the other Planets so many Earths, 
3    6             and all the Stars Worlds, it  was necessary for the explaining my self, to bring my Arguments 
3    6             a great way off; and therefore I still endeavoured to perswade her 
3    6             that 'twas much better to pass the time in another manner of Conversation, which the
3    6             most reasonable People in our Circumstances would do; but I 
3    6             pleaded to no Purpose, and at last to satisfie her, and give her a general
3    6             Idea of Philosophy, I made use of this way of arguing.

3   4            [Page 24] [] <RW>  cent autres rêveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation
3   4            toute l'Antiquité </RW>. A la fin Descartes, & quelques autres Modernes sont venus, qui 
3   4            ont dit: Phaéton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, & qu'un poids plus pesant que lui
3   4           descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &
3   4            en quelque facon tire' par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il [Page 25] monte ou qu'il descende, si 
3   4            ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids ou d'un ressort; & qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, 
3   4            ne verroit que le derrière du Théâtre de l'Opéra. A ce compte, dit la <IIM> Marquise </IIM>, 
3   4            la Philosophie est devenue bien mécanique? Si mécanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on 
3   4            en ait bientôt honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en 
3   4           petit, & que tout s'y conduise par des mouvements régléz qui [Page 26] dépendent de
3   4            l'arrangement des parties. Avouez la vérité. N'avez-vous pas eu quelquefois une idée plus
3   4            sublime de l'Univers, & ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne méritoit? J'ay vu 
3   4           des gens qui l'en estimoient moins, <NCE> depuis qu'ils l'avoient connu </NCE>. Et moy, 
3   4           répliqua-t'elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sais qu'il ressemble à une Montre. 
3   4           Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des 
3   4           choses si simples. </P003>

3   3           [Page 6] <RW> a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the 
3   3           Reputation of Antiquity</RW>: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, 
3   3           who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy 
3   3           than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse 
3   3           from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by 
3   3           some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look 
3   3           behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very
3   3           mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have 
3   3           it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular
3   3           movements that depend upon the disposal of the [Page  7] several parts. Now confess the
3   3           truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? And
3   3           have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after
3   3           knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it
3   3           resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, 
3   3          so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple.

                    <P006>
3    4           [Page  10] [] <RW> a Man must conclude the Old Sages were very good 
3    4            Banterers </RW>: But now comes Monsieur Descartes, with some of the 
3    4            Moderns, and they tell you Phaeton ascends because a greater weight than 
3    4            he descends; so that now we do not believe a Body can move without it is 
3    4            push'd and forc'd by another body, and as it were drawn by Cords, so that 
3    4            nothing can rise or fall but by the means of a Counterpoise; he then that 
3    4            will see Nature really as she is, must stand behind the Scenes at the 
3    4            Opera. I perceive, said the <IIM> Countess </IIM>, Philosophy is now 
3    4            become very Mechanical. So mechanical, said I, that I fear we shall 
3    4            quickly be asham'd of it; they will have the World to be in great, what a 
3    4            Watch is in little; which is very regular, and depends only upon the just 
3    4            disposing of the several parts of the movement. But pray tell me, Madam, 
3    4            had you not formerly a more sublime Idea of the Universe? Do you not 
3    4            think you did then honour it more than it deserv'd? For most have the 
3    4            less esteem of it since [Page  11] they have < IIM> pretended </IIM> to 
3    4            know it. I am not of their opinion, said she, I value it the more since I 
3    4            know it resembles a Watch, and the whole order of Nature the more plain 
3    4            and easie it is, to me it appears the more admirable.

3    8            [Page 11] [] Besides a hundred other <NCE>Notions</NCE>, which I wonder have 
3    8             not intirely [Page 12] ruined the Reputation of the Ancients. In our Age Des Cartes, and
3    8             some other Moderns would say - That Phaetons's flight upward is because he is hoisted by
3    8            Ropes, and that while he ascends, a greater weight than he descends. 
                    </P008>
                    <P009>
3    9           And now men do not believe that any corporeal being moves it self, unless it be set on
3    9           Motion, or pusht by another Body, or drawn by Ropes; nor that any heavy thing ascends or
3    9           descends, without a counter-poise equal with it in weight to balance it; or that 'tis guided by 
3    9           Springs. And could we see Nature as it is, we should see nothing but the hinder part of the
3    9           Theatre at the Opera. By what you say, said Madam la Marquiese, Philosophy is become very 
3    9           Mechanical. So very Mechanical, said I, that I am afraid men will quickly be ashamed of it;
3    9           for some would have the Universe no other thing in Greeat, than a Watch is in Little; and
3    9           that all things in it are ordered [Page 13] by Regular Motion, which depends upon the just
3    9           and equal disposal of its Parts; Confess the Truth, Madam, have not you had heretofore a
3    9           more sublime Idea of the Universe, and have not you honoured it with a better opinion than
3    9           it deserved? I have known several esteem it less since <NCE> they believed they knew it
3    9           better </NCE>; and for my part, said she, I esteem it more since I knew it is so like a Watch:
3    9           And 'tis most surprising to me, that the course and order of Nature, how ever admirable
3    9           it appears to be, moves upon Principles and Things that are so very easie and simple. []

33    28            inequalitys; but how can they distinguish Sea and Land? Thus, says I; 
33    28            because the Waters that let part of the Light pass through them and 
33    28            reflect less, appear at a distance obscure Spots, and the Land, which

33    28            those parts are so well known, that they have all Names given them,

33    21            because of the remarkable inequality; but how do they distinguish Lands 
33    21            and Seas? Very easily, said I, for the Waters letting part of the Light 
33    21            pass thro' them, send back but a very little, so that they appear afar 
33    21            off like so many dark Spots; whereas the Lands being solid, reflect the 
33    21            whole Light, and appear to be more bright and shining: Nay, they pretend 
33    21            to be so well acquainted with the several parts that they have given them 
33    21            all Names; one place they call Copernicus, another Archimedes, another

33    24            discover'd in the Moon, by the remarkable Inequality we see in 
33    24            its Surface; But how do they 
33    24            distinguish Countries and Seas? Very easily, said I; because the 
33    24            Water permits a part of the Light to 
33    24            pass through it, and reflects less, and appears, at a great 
33    24            distance, to be obscure Spots; and that the 
33    24            Earth, which is solid, reflects the whole Light, and therefore 
33    24            must appear the brightest part of the

58    58            suffiroit pour les glacier. Leur année [Page 225] n'est que de trois mois. La durée de leur jour 
58    58            ne nous est point encore connuë , parce que Mercure est si petit & si proche du

58    58            fait croire qu'il acheve ce tour en peu de temps; que par consequent le jour de 
58    58            Mercure est fort court , & [Page 226] que les Habitans voyent le Soleil comme un <RW> 
58    58            grand poële ardent </RW> , peu éloigné de leurs tête , & qui va d'une rapidité profigeuse.

58    54            Sun, and therefore certainly must needs be fools with too much 
58    54            vivacity. I believe they have no memory no more than the greatest 
58    54            part of Negro's and that they never consider on any thing, nor act 
58    54            but by chance, and suddain motions; and in fine, that <IIM> Mercury 
58    54            is the Bedlam </IIM> of the Universe. They see the Sun <RW> much bigger 
58    54            than we do </RW>, because they are much nearer, and he gives them so strong 
58    54            a light, that were they here, they would esteem our fairest days but 
58    54            as weak twilight, and perhaps would not be able to distinguish 
58    54            Objects by it, and they are us'd to so excessive a Heat, that they 
58    54            would freez in the midst of Africa; their year is but three months, 
58    54            the length of their day is yet unknown to us; for Mercury is so 
58    54            little and so near [Page  54] the Sun, in whose Rays he is almost 
58    54            continually lost, that he escapes all observation of Astronomers, and 
58    54            they cannot yet lay hold on him so much as to observe what motion he 
58    54            makes about his Center: but his smalness makes them believe that he 
58    54            performs that Course in a little time, and that therefore the days in 
58    54            Mercury are short, and that the Inhabitants see the Sun like <RW> a 
58    54            great burning Stove or Kettle </RW> not far above their heads, and 
58    54            moving with a prodigious rapidity. It is well for them, for 'tis 
58    54            certain they are very desirous of the night, during which time they 
58    54            are inlightened by Venus and the Earth, which ought to appear very 
58    54            big to them. As for the other Planets, <RW>they being beyond the Earth 
58    54            toward the Firmament </RW>, seem less to them than they do to us, and they 
58    54            receive but little or perhaps no Light at all from thence. <RW> The fixed 
58    54            Stars likewise seem less to them, and many are not seen at all </RW>, which 
58    54            in my opinion is a loss. I am not well pleas'd to see that great Arch

58    48            yet nearer to the Sun, and are so full of Fire, <UP> that they are absolutely 
58    48            mad; I fancy, they have no memory at all, like most of the Negroes, that 
58    48            they make no reflections, and what they do is by sudden starts, and 
58    48            perfect hap-hazard; <NCE> in short, Mercury is the Bedlam of the Universe </NCE>;  
58    48            the Sun appears to them <RW> much greater than it does to us </RW>, because they are 
58    48            much nearer to it than we; it sends them so vast and strong a light, that 
58    48            the most glorious day here, would be no more with them than a declining 
58    48            [Page  97] twilight: I know not if they can distinguish Objects, but the 
58    48            heat to which they are accustom'd, is so excessive, that they would be 
58    48            starved with cold in the Torrid Zone; their year is but three Months, but 
58    48            we know not the exact length of their Day, because Mercury is so little, 
58    48            and so near the Sun; it is, (as it were) lost in his Rays, and is very 
58    48            hardly discover'd by the Astronomers; so that they cannot observe how it 
58    48            moves on its Centre, but because it is so little, fancy it compleats its 
58    48            motion in a little time; so that by consequence, the day there is very 
58    48            short, and the Sun appears to them like <RW> a vast fiery Furnace at a little 
58    48            distance </RW>, whose motion is prodigiously swift and rapid; and during their 
58    48            Night, Venus and the Earth (which must appear considerably big) give 
58    48            light to them; as for the other Planets <RW> which are beyond the Earth, 
58    48            towards the Firmament </RW>, they appear less to them in Mercury, than they do 
58    48            to us here, and they receive but little light from them, perhaps none at 
58    48            all; <RW>the fix'd Stars likewise [Page  98] seem less to them, and some of 
58    48            'em totally disappear </RW>, which were I there, I should esteem a very great </UP> 
58    48            loss.

58    44            [Page 99] [] But what then must the Inhabitants of Mercury be, for they are yet more
58    44            near to the Sun? They must certainly be mad, by having too much Light and Fire; and
58    44            [Page 100] I believe they have no more Memory, than the most part of our Negroes; they
58    44            never think, and are void of all Reflection, and they only act by Chance, and by sudden
58    44            Impulses. In short,  the Planet Mercury <IIM> must certainly be the Bethlem </IIM> of 
58    44            the Universe; <RW> they see the Sun a great deal bigger than we do, </RW>
58    44            because they are so much nearer to it; he darts upon 'em so strong a Light, that if the
58    44            Inhabitants of Venus were here, they wou'd take our finest Days for the Remains 
58    44            of a <IIM> saint </IIM> Twi-light; and it may be, the Light we enjoy, wou'd not serve 
58    44            them to distinguish one Object from another; and the Heat they are accustom'd to is 
58    44            so excessive, that the greatest warmth enjoy'd by the Inhabitants of the middle of Africk,
58    44            wou'd frieze them to death. Their Year casts but three Months; the length of their Day is
58    44            yet unknown, Mercury being so little a Planet, and so near the Sun, in whose Rays he is 
58    44            so continually lost, that he is hitherto scarce discoverable by <RW> the Art and Skill of </RW> 
58    44            Astronomers, who cou'd never yet get so much hold of Mercury, as 
58    44            to observe the Time in which he performs his Revolution <RW> upon his own Axis </RW>
58    44           [Page 101]  or Centre; but the smallness <UP> of his Planet </UP> perswades me 'tis in a
58    44            very short time, and then, by consequence, his Days are very short, and his Inhabitants
58    44            must see the Sun <RW> as a very great flaming Brasier </RW>, very near their Heads,
58    44            which, to their Apprehension, moves with wonderful Rapidity; this makes them so
58    44            earnestly wish for the coming Night, which, no doubt, must be much more grateful to 'em 
58    44            than the Day; and during those cooler Hours, they are enlightned by Venus, and by 
58    44            the Earth; which two Planets must appear to them of considerable bigness. As for 
58    44            the other Planets, since they are remov'd further than <RW><IIM> Mercury [the Earth in 
58    44            Fontenelle and the other translators] </IIM>  towards the Firmament </RW> his 
58    44            Inhabitants must see them less than they appear to us, and receive but little Light from
58    44            'em, it may be, none at all; the fixed Stars must appear less to 'em also, and they lose the
58    44            sight of some of 'em entirely, which, in my Opinion, is a very great Loss; for I shou'd 
58    44            be very sorry to see <RW> the vast arch'd Roof of the Heavens adorn'd with fewer Stars,
58    44            or those I do see, appear less, and not so bright. </RW>

64    64            [Page 244] [] Ah ! Madame , répliquai-je , Si vous saviez ce que c'est que les <RW> <NCP> 
64    64            Tourbillons </NCP> de Descartes </RW>, ces Tourbillons dont le nom est si terrible , & l'idée 
64    64            si agreable , vous ne parleriez pas comme vous [Page 245] faites. La tête me dût-elle tourner ,
64    64            dit elle en riant , il est beau de savoir ce que c'est que les Tourbillons. Achevez de me 
64    64            rendre folle , je ne me ménage plus , je ne connois plus de retenuë sur la Philosophie; 
64    64            laissons parler le monde , & donnons-nous aux Tourbillons. Je ne vous connaissois pas de 
64    64            pareils emportements , répris-je; c'est dommage qu'ils n'ayent que les 
64    64            Tourbillons pour objet. Ce qu'on appelle un Tourbillon , c'est un amas de matiere 
64    64            dont les [Page 246] parties sont détachées les unes des autres , & se meuvent toutes en un 
64    64            même sens; permis à elles d'avoir pendant ce temps-là quelques petites 
64    64            mouvements particuliers , pourveu qu'elles suivent toûjours le mouvement 
64    64            general. Ainsi un Tourbillon de vent <UP>  </UP>, c'est une infinité de petites parties d'air , 
64    64            qui tournent en rond toutes ensemble , & enveloppent ce qu'elles rencontrent. Vous 
64    64            savez que les Planetes sont portées dans la matiere celeste , qui est [Page 247] d'une 
64    64            subtilité , & d'une agitation prodigieuse. Tout ce grand amas de matiere celeste , 
64    64            qui est depuis le Soleil <UP>  </UP>jusqu'aux Etoiles fixes , tourne en rond , & emportant 
64    64            avec soy les Planetes <UP>  </UP> , les fait tourner toutes en un même sens autour du Soleil 
64    64            , qui occupe le centre; mais en des temps plus ou moins longs, selon qu'elles en sont 
64    64            plus ou moins éloignées. Il n'y a pas jusqu'au Soleil qui ne tourne ; mais il ne 
64    64            tourne que sur luy-même , parce qu'il est [Page 248] justement au milieu de toute cette 
64    64            <IIM> matiere celeste </IIM>; & vous remarquerez en passant , que quand la Terre seroit 
64    64            dans la place où il est , elle ne pourroit encore faire moins que de tourner sur elle-
64    64            même.

64    60            	Ah! Madam, said I, did you but know what the <RW> Vortices of 
64    60            Descartes </RW> are, Vortices whose name is so terrible and Idea so 
64    60            agreeable, you would not talk as you do. What, says she laughing, 
64    60            must my Head turn round? 'twill be pleasant to know what these 
64    60            Vortices are; pray make an end of fooling me, I can no longer govern 
64    60            my self, nor muse longer upon Philosophy, let us leave talking of the 
64    60            World, and begin with these Vortices. I never knew you so 
64    60            transported, said I, 'tis pity there is any other Objects than 
64    60            Vortices. A Vortex is a mass of matter whose parts are lose one from 
64    60            the other, and move all in conformity to themselves; but in the mean 
64    60            time you must allow them some little particular motions, provided 
64    60            they still follow the general motion. So a Whirlwind is an infinity 
64    60            of little parts of Air, that turn round altogether and inclose all 
64    60            they meet. You know the Planets are carried in the celestial matter, 
64    60            which is of a prodigious subtilty and agitation. All that great mass 
64    60            of celestial matter from the Sun to the fixed Stars turns round and 
64    60            carrying the Planets with it, makes [Page  59] them turn all 
64    60            uniformly about the Sun, which possesses the Center, but in more or 
64    60            less time, according as their distances are more or less from him. 
64    60            All even to the Sun it self turn, but he turns only about himself, 
64    60            because he is just in the Center of that celestial matter, and you 
64    60            must observe by the way, that were the Earth in the Center it could 
64    60            do no less than turn upon its own Axis.

64    53            <P053>
64    53            	[Page  105]Ah, Madam, said I, if you knew what were <RW>Descartes's 
64    53            Whirlpools or Vortex's </RW>, <NCP> (whose Name is terrible, but 
64    53            their Idea pleasant) </NCP> you would not talk as you do. Must my Head, says she, 
64    53            smiling, turn round to comprehend 'em, or must I become a perfect Fool to 
64    53            understand the misteries of Philosophy? Well, let the World say what it will, go on 
64    53            with your Whirlpools. I will, said I, and you shall see the Whirlpools are 
64    53            worthy of these transports: That then which we call a Whirlpool, or 
64    53            Vortex, is a Mass of Matter, whose parts are separated or detach'd one 
64    53            from another, yet have all one uniform motion, and at the same time, 
64    53            every one is allow'd, or has a particular Motion of its own, provided if 
64    53            follows the general Motion: Thus a Vortex of Wind, or Whirlwind, is an 
64    53            infinity of little particles of Air, which turn round all together, and 
64    53            involve what ever they meet with. You know the Planets are born up by the 
64    53            Celestial Matter, which is prodigiously subtile and active; so that this 
64    53            [Page  106] great Mass, or <IIM> Ocean of </IIM> Celestial Matter, which 
64    53            flows as far as from the Sun to the fix'd Stars, turns round, and bears the Planets 
64    53            along with it, making them all turn after the same manner round the Sun, 
64    53            who possesses the Centre, but in a longer or shorter time, according as 
64    53            they are farther or nearer in distance to it; there is nothing to the 
64    53            very Sun, which does not turn, but he turns on himself because he is just 
64    53            in the middle of this Celestial Matter; and you must know by the way, 
64    53            that were the Earth in his place, it must turn on it self, as the Sun 
64    53            does. This is the great Vortex, of which the Sun is Lord; yet at the same 
64    53            time, the Planets make little particular Vortex's, in imitation of that 
64    53            of the Sun, each of 'em in turning round the Sun, doth at the same time 
64    53            turn round it self, and makes a certain quantity of Celestial Matter turn 
64    53            round it likewise, which is always prepar'd to follow the Motion the 
64    53            Planet gives it, provided it is not diverted from its general Motion; 
64    53            this then is the particular [Page  107] Vortex of the Planet, which 
64    53            pushes it as far as the strength of its Motion reaches; and if by chance, 
64    53            a lesser Planet falls into the Vortex of a greater Planet, it is 
64    53            immediately born away by the greater, and is indispensably forc'd to turn 
64    53            round it, tho' at the same time, the great Planet, the little Planet, and 
64    53            the Vortex which encloses 'em, all turn round the Sun: 'Twas thus at the 
64    53            beginning of the World, when we made the Moon follow us, because she was 
64    53            within the reach of our Vortex, and therefore wholly at our dispose: 
64    53            Jupiter was stronger, or more fortunate than we, he had four little 
64    53            Planets in his neighbourhood, and he brought 'em all four under his 
64    53            subjection; and <UP> no doubt </UP>, we, tho' a principal Planet, had had 
64    53            the same Fate, had we been within the Sphere of his Activity; he is ninety times 
64    53            bigger than the Earth, and would certainly have swallow'd us into his 
64    53            Vortex; we had then been no more than a Moon in his Family, when now we 
64    53            have one to wait on us; so that [Page  108] you see the advantage of 
64    53            Situation, decides often all our good Fortune.

64    49            <P049>
64    49            Ah, Madam! said I; if you understood <RW>the Tourbillions, or Whistlings of Monsieur 
64    49            Des Cartes </RW>, whose Name is so terrible, and Idea's so agreeable, you wou'd not
64    49            talk at that rate. Let my Brains turn round, said she, laughing, if they 
64    49            will; I long to know what these Tourbillions 
64    49            are; make haste therefore to satisfie me, I'll manage my self no 
64    49            longer, but henceforth abandon all 
64    49            my Thoughts to Philosophy, without Reserve, let the World talk 
64    49            what they please; but let me 
64    49            understand these Whirling's. I did not think you capable of such 
64    49            Transports, said I, Madam; and I am 
64    49            sorry they have not a fitter Object: But to satisfie you, a 
64    49            Tourbillion is a heap of Matter, whose parts 
64    49            are disjoin'd one from another, yet moving round all one way; 
64    49            each little part being allow'd a 
64    49            particular Motion of its own, provided always they do not 
64    49            obstruct the general Circular Motion. As 
64    49            for Example; A [Page 110] Tourbillion of Air, <UP> call'd a 
64    49            Whirl-wind, or a Hurricain </UP>, is an 
64    49            infinite quantity of little Particles of Air, turning all round 
64    49            together, carrying along every thing they 
64    49            meet with in their way: You know that the Planets are carry'd 
64    49            round in the Celestial Matter, which is 
64    49            incredibly subtile and swift; all that <UP> vast Ocean, </UP> 
64    49            and Mass of Celestial Substance, which 
64    49            is between the Sun, <UP> and the Sphere </UP> of the fixed 
64    49            Stars, turns round, and carries with it 
64    49            the Planets one way, <UP> from East to West, </UP> round the 
64    49            Sun, which is plac'd in the Centre; but 
64    49            in shorter or longer time, as they are distant or nearer the 
64    49            Centre, all things turn round, even the Sun 
64    49            it self; but he turns round upon his own Axis: And you are to 
64    49            observe thus; if the Earth were in the 
64    49            middle of the Celestial Matter, as the Sun is, she wou'd also 
64    49            turn round upon her own Axis, like that: 
64    49            This is that great Tourbillion, of which the Sun is, as it were, 
64    49            Governor; but at the same time, all the 
64    49            Planets have little Whirlings peculiar to themselves, in 
64    49            imitation of that great one, the Sun; 
64    49            notwithstanding, they are all carry'd round the Sun, yet every 
64    49            one of them turns round upon his [Page 111] own Axis, and sweeps 
64    49            along with him a share of the Celestial Substance, which yields 
64    49            easily to any Impulse of Motion it receives, provided that does not 
64    49            obstruct its general Motion round the Sun; 
64    49            and this is call'd the particular Whirling, or Tourbillion of a 
64    49            Planet, which extends as far as <UP> the 
64    49            Sphere of its Activity </UP> can reach; and if it falls so out, 
64    49            that any lesser Planet than that which 
64    49            governs the Tourbillion comes in its way, 'tis carry'd with it, 
64    49            and indispensably forc'd round it; but yet 
64    49            that does not hinder both the greater Planet, and the lesser, 
64    49            with their Whirlings, to turn round with 
64    49            the great Tourbillion of the Sun. 'Twas thus that, after the 
64    49            Creation of the Universe, the Earth carry'd 
64    49            the Moon round it self, because the Moon fell within the Extent 
64    49            or Sphere of Activity, and forc'd its 
64    49            Obedience. Iupiter, of whom I have said somewhat already, was 
64    49            happier or stronger than we; there 
64    49            fell four little Planets in his Neighbourhood, and he subdu'd 
64    49            'em all four: Our Earth, which is now a 
64    49            chief Planet, had it fallen within the Tourbillion of Iupiter, 
64    49            you may easily believe he wou'd have 
64    49            forc'd us to have turn'd round [Page 112] him also, Iupiter 
64    49            being ninety times bigger than our Earth; 
64    49            and then we had been nothing but a Moon depending upon Iupiter, 
64    49            whereas now the Earth has a 
64    49            Moon of her own turning round her: So true it is, that Chance of 
64    49            Situation has decided our Fortune. 
64    49            Pray, what Assurance have we, said the Marquiese, that our Earth 
64    49            shall always remain in the same 
64    49            Situation? I am afraid we may make a Trip one Day or other, 
64    49            towards some Planet as dangerous as 
64    49            Iupiter, who may sweep us round with it self; or that some other 
64    49            stronger Planet may approach 
64    49            nearer to us; for I fansie, that the violent Motions of the 
64    49            heavenly Matter you speak of, may agitate 
64    49            and shake the Planets so irregularly, that it might sometimes 
64    49            bring 'em nearer together, and at other 
64    49            times remove 'em farther from one another.

[It is necessary that the Peoples of that World do not know only by reputation the hundredth

each other [Page 275], they live familiarly together, and count only for a walk to go around 
their World. If we are not seen in Jupiter, you can well imagine that Venus and Mercury, which 
are Worlds both smaller and farther from it, are seen even less. In compensation, its

75    69            [Page 65] []  It must needs be that the people of that World do 
75    69            not know the hundredth part of it; whereas in Mercury, which is very 
75    69            little, they are all Neighbours, live very familiarly together, and 
75    69            count it but a Walk, to make a turn about their World. If they do not 
75    69            see us from Iupiter, you will easily judge that the people of that 
75    69            Planet do much less see Venus and Mercury, which are both lesser 
75    69            Worlds, and more distant from him. But to make amends, his 
75    69            inhabitants see Mars, and their own four Moons, and Saturn with his. 
75    69            These are Planets enough to perplex their Astronomers, and Nature has

75    58             [Page 116] [] I warrant you, they have not yet 
75    58            discover'd the hundredth part of their Planet; when Mercury is so little, they are 
75    58            all <NCP> (as it were) </NCP> near Neighbours, and 'tis but taking a 
75    58            walk, to go round that Planet. But if we do not appear to 'em in Jupiter, they cannot 
75    58            certainly discover Venus and Mercury, which are much less than the Earth, 
75    58            and at a greater distance; but in lieu of it, they see Mars, their own 
75    58            four Moons, and Saturn, with his; this I think is work enough for their 
75    58            Astronomers; and Nature hath been so kind to conceal from 'em the rest of 
75    58            the Universe. Do you think it a favour then, says she? Yes, certainly, 
75    58            said I, for there are sixteen Planets [Page  117] in this great Vortex: 
75    58            Nature saves us the trouble of studying the Motions of 'em all, and shows 
75    58            us but seven, which I think is very obliging, tho' we know not how to 
75    58            value the kindness, for we have recover'd the other nine which were hid 
75    58            from us, and so render'd the Science of Astronomy much more difficult

77    71            are but lately discovered; but there is a thing yet much more 
77    71            remarkable, one of his years being thirty of ours, and by consequence 
77    71            there being Countreys in him, whose night is of fifteen years 
77    71            continuance, guess you what Nature has invented to inlighten such 
77    71            terrible nights. [Page  66] She was not satisfy'd with bestowing five 
77    71            Moons upon Saturn, but she has also inclos'd him with a great Circle 
77    71            or Ring, which is high enough raised to be out of the Shadow of the 
77    71            Body of that Planet, and continually reflects the Light of the Sun

77    59            [Page 117] [] If there are sixteen Planets, says she, Saturn must have five 
77    59            Moons. 'Tis very true, said I, and two of these five, are but lately 
77    59            discover'd; but there is somewhat that is more remarkable, since his Year 
77    59            is thirty of ours, there are consequently in him some Countreys, where 
77    59            their Night is fifteen years long; and what can you imagine Nature hath 
77    59            invented to give light, during so dreadful a Night? Why, she hath not 
77    59            only given Saturn five Moons, but she hath encompass'd him round with a 
77    59            great Circle or Ring, the which being plac'd beyond the reach of the 
77    59            shadow which the Body of that Planet casts, reflects the light of the Sun

77    57            Saturn must have five Moons. He 
77    57            has so, said I, Madam, and two of the five are discover'd very 
77    57            lately, but there is yet something more 
77    57            remarkable in that Planet; for his Year is as long as thirty of 
77    57            ours; and consequently there are <IIM> 
77    57            Climates in that World [translates "des Pays" (Fontenelle, p. 
77    57            277)],</IIM> where one Night lasts for fifteen 
77    57            Years together. Can you guess what Nature has intended for the 
77    57            enlightning of Nights so long and 
77    57            dreadful? She was not satisfied to bestow on Saturn five Moons; 
77    57            but has also given him a great Circle 
77    57            or Ring, which environs him entirely, and which is elevated 
77    57            sufficiently high enough to be out of the 
77    57            shadow of this Planet. It reflects the Light of the Sun 
77    57            perpetually upon the <RW> Inhabitants of 
77    57            Saturn, who have the Misfortune to live in that Climate </RW>,

88    62            this great Azure Vault of the Heavens, wherein the Stars were placed, as it were so many
88    62            golden Nails or Studs, the Universe seem'd to me too little and strait; I fansied my

100    100            [Page 332] Cometes ne sont que des Planetes qui appartiennent à un Tourbillon voisin.

100    97            [Page 331] []Ah! says she, laughing, what kind of Embassadours are those? We 
100    97            might well excuse their Visit, for they serve only to scare people.

100    98            	They scare none but Children, said I, because of their 
100    98            extraordinary Equipage, but those Children indeed are many. Comets 
100    98            are only Planets that belong to a neighbouring Vortex.

100    79            commerce; the Neighbouring Worlds sometimes send visits to us, and that 
100    79            in a very magnificent and splendid manner

100    72            	Good God! said the Marquiese, laughing; What Ambassadors 
100    72            are these? We cou'd easily dispence with their Visits, for they do nothing but fright us. 
100    72            They fright <UP> only Fools [</UP> and Children, 
100    72            Madam, said I; but of those <UP> Ignorants </UP>, I confess, 
100    72            there are a great number: The Comets are nothing but Planets 
100    72            which belong to some neighbouring Tourbillion, 
100    72            who make their Course toward the Extremity, or Out-side of it
