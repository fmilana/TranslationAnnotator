Je sens, Monsieur, que je vais vous faire une Description, mais il n'ya a pas moyen de vous l'épargner, la chose m'y porte necessairement. La Lune estoit levée il y avoit Page 8] peut-estre une heure, &amp; ses rayons qui ne venoient à nous qu'entre les branches des arbres, faisoient un agreable mélange d'un blanc fort vif, avec tout ce verd qui paroissait noir. Il n'y avoit pas un nuage qui dérobast ou qui obscurcist <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">la moyndre Etoile</span></span>; elles etoient toutes d'un or pur &amp; éclatant, &amp; qui estoit encore relevé par le fond bleu où elles sont attachées. Ce spectacle me fit resver, &amp; peut-estre sans la Marquise eussay-je resvé assez longtemps; mais la présence d'une si aimable Dame, ne me permit pas de m'abandonner à la Lune &amp; aux Etoiles. Ne trouvez-vous pas, luy dis-je, que <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">le jour mesme n'est pas si beau qu'une belle nuit</span></span>? Oüi, me répondit-elle, la beauté du jour est comme une Beauté blonde, qui a plus de brillant; mais la beauté de la nuit est une Beauté brune qui est plus touchante. Vous estes bien genereuse, repris-je, de donner cet avantage aux Brunes, vous qui ne l'estes pas. Il est pourtant vrai que le jour est ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans la Nature, &amp; que les <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Heroïnes de Romans</span></span>, qui sont ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans l'imagination, sont presque toûjours blondes. Ce n'est rien que la beauté, repliqua-t-elle, si elle ne touche. Avoüez que le jour ne vous eust jamais jetté dans une resverie aussi douce que celle où je vous ay veu prest de tomber tout à l'heure à la veuë de cette belle nuit. J'en conviens, répondis-je; mais en récompense, une Blonde comme vous, me feroit encore mieux resver que la plus belle nuit du monde avec toute sa beauté brune. Quand cela serait vray, repliqua-t-elle, je ne m'en contenterois pas. Je voudrais que le jour, puisque les Blondes doivent estre dans ses interests, fist aussi le mesme effet. Pourquoy les Amants, qui sont bons Juges de ce qui touche, ne s'adressent-ils jamais qu'à la nuit dans toutes les Chansons &amp; toutes les Elegies que je connois? Il faut bien que la nuit ait leurs remerciemens, luy dis-je. Mais, reprit-elle, elle a aussi toutes leurs plaintes; le jour ne s'attire point leurs confidences; d'où cela vient-il? C'est apparemment, répondis-je, qu'il n'inspire point je ne sçay quoi de triste &amp; de passionné. Il semble pendant la nuit que tout soit en repos. On s'imagine que les Etoiles marchent avec plus de silence que le Soleil; les objets que le Ciel presente sont plus doux; la veuë s'y arreste plus aisément; &amp; enfin on est si fou que l'on en resve mieux, parce qu'on se flate d'estre alors dans toute la Nature la seule personne occupée à resver. Peut-estre aussi que le spectacle du jour est trop uniforme, ce n'est qu'un Soleil, &amp; une voûte bleüe, mais il se peut que la veuë de toutes ces Etoiles semées confusément, &amp; disposées au hazard en mille figures diferentes, favorise la resverie, &amp; un certain desordre de pensées où l'on ne tombe point sans plaisir. J'ay toûjours senty ce que vous me dites, reprit-elle, j'aime les Etoiles, &amp; je me plaindrois volontiers du Soleil qui nous les efface. Ah! m'écriay-je, je ne peux luy pardonner de me faire perdre de veuë tous ces Mondes. Qu'appelez-vous tous ces Mondes, me dit-elle en me regardant, &amp; en se tournant vers moy? Je vous demande pardon, répondis-je. Vous m'avez mis sur ma folie, &amp; aussi-tost mon imagination s'est échapée. Quelle est donc cette folie, reprit-elle? Helas, repliquay-je, je suis bien fâché qu'il faille vous l'avoüer; je me suis mis dans la teste que chaque Etoile pourroit bien estre un Monde<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">. Je ne jurerois pourtant pas que cela fust vray</span></span>, mais je le tiens pour vray, parce qu'il me fait plaisir à croire.<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\"> C'est une idée qui me réjoüit, &amp; qui s'est placée dans mon esprit d'une maniere riante</span></span>. Selon moy, il n'y a pas jusqu'aux Veritez à qui l'agrément ne soit necessaire. Et bien, reprit-elle, puis que vostre folie est si réjoüissante, donnez-la-moy, je croiray sur les Etoiles tout ce qu'il vous plaira, pourveu que j'y trouve du plaisir. Ah? Madame, répondis-je bien viste, ce n'est pas un plaisir comme celuy que vous auriez à une Comedie de Moliere; ç'en est un qui est je ne sçay où dans la raison, &amp; qui ne fait rire que l'esprit. Quoy donc, reprit-elle, croyez-vous qu'on soit incapable des plaisirs qui ne sont que dans la raison? Je veux tout à l'heure vous faire voir le contraire, apprenez-moy vos Etoiles. Non, repliquay-je, il ne me sera point reproché que dans un Bois, à dix heures du soir, j'aye parlé de Philosophie à la plus aimable personne que je connoisse.

I find I am falling into a Description, and I cannot well avoid it, the Subject leads me naturally to it. The Moon was about an hour high, and her beams, which came to us through the branches of the trees, made a pleasing mixture of a lively white, with all that green which then appeared black; not one Cloud appear'd to rob us of, or obscure, the least Star; they were all of Gold, pure and bright, and the appearance was yet heighten'd by the azure ground, in which they were set. The prospect set me a musing, and perhaps without the Marchioness I had long continued so, but the presence of so fair a Lady withdrew my Admiration from the Moon and Stars. Do not you find, said I to her, that the day it self is not so beautiful as a clear night? 'Tis true, said she, the beauty of the day is like a fair Beauty that sparkles more; but the beauty of the night is a black beauty, that has more of charm. You are very generous, said I, to allow that advantage to the black, who have so little of it in your self; yet 'tis true, that the day is the most beautiful thing in Nature, and the Heroines of Romances, who are the greatest Beauties we can imagine, are ever represented fair. That's no Beauty, says she, unless it charm; you must confess that the day never put you into so sweet a Contemplation, as you were now fallen into at the prospect of this so bright a night. I grant you that, said I; but yet so fair a Creature as you, would put me in a deeper contemplation, than all the dark beauties of the most glorious night. Were that true, said she, I should not be satisfied: I would have the day, since the fair are concern'd in it, to have the same effect. Why is it that Lovers, who are good Judges of what is charming, ever, in all their Songs and Elegys that I have met with, address themselves to the Night? 'Tis doubtless, said I; because it most obliges them. But, says she, it has likewise all their Complaints; the Day shares not at all in their Confidence: from whence should this proceed? Because, said I, 'tis certain it creates not that unexpressable sort of sadness and passion. In the Night all things seem in repose, we fancy the Stars more silent in their motion than the Sun, the objects of Heaven are more pleasing, and entertain the Eye with less trouble; and in fine, we are such fools that we can muse better on them; because we flatter our selves that we are then the only persons in nature that are so imploy'd. Possibly likewise there is too much uniformity in the prospect of the Day, 'tis all but one Sun, one blue Arch, but the prospect of the Stars confusedly set, and disposed at randon in a thousand different figures, indulges our Contemplation, and creates a certain pleasing disorder in our thoughts. I have ever found, says she, what you tell me; I love the Stars, and complain heartily of the Sun that robs us of them. Oh! cry'd I, I cannot forgive him when he takes from me the sight of so many Worlds. How, (says she, looking on me, and turning towards me) do you call all those Worlds? I ask your pardon, said I, you have brought me into my folly, and I as soon discovered it. Pray, says she, what folly is that? Faith, said I, I find my self necessitated to acknowledge it to you, and 'tis this; I have had a fancy that every Star may possibly be a World. I will not swear 'tis true, but that is my opinion, because I find pleasure in believing it: 'Tis an Idea that tickles, and has with delight taken possession of my thoughts; and truly, in my opinion, delight is not amiss even in Truth it self. Well, says she, since your Folly is so delightful, pray let me have a share in it, I'l believe what you please of the Stars, provided I find pleasure in it. Ah! Madam, said I, 'tis not a pleasure like that which you find in a Comedy of Moliere; 'tis a pleasure, I know not where, in the reason, and delights only the Mind. And pray, says she, do you think me incapable of pleasures that are only in the Reason; bring me acquainted with your Stars, and you shall presently see the contrary. No, said I, it shall never be laid to my charge, that in a Grove, at ten of clock at night, I entertain'd the most lovely person in the World with nothing but Philosophy, look out for such Philosophers elsewhere.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P002: 'TWas then in the Evening, after Supper, that we took a walk into the Park; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">the Air was delicate and fresh</span></span>, which made amends for the heat of the day.

Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, &amp; quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, &amp; que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne sçavois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle qui ne sçavoit rien en matiere de <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Phisique</span></span>, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit estre une Planete; &amp; les Planetes autant de Terres, &amp; toutes les <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">Etoiles des Mondes</span></span>. J'en revenois toûjours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en nostre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay. </p><p>P004: Toute la Philosophie, luy dis-je, n'est fondée que sur deux choses, sur ce qu'on a l'esprit curieux &amp; les yeux mauvais; car si vous aviez les yeux meilleurs que vous ne les avez, vous verriez bien si ce sont des Mondes que les Etoiles, ou si elles ne sont pas des Mondes; &amp; si d'un autre costé vous étiez moins curieuse, vous ne vous soucieriez pas de le sçavoir, ce qui reviendrait au mesme. Mais on veut sçavoir plus qu'on ne voit, c'est-là la difficulté. Encore si ce qu'on voit, on le voyoit bien, ce seroit toûjours autant de connu, mais on le voit tout autrement qu'il n'est. Ainsi les vrais Philosophes passent leur vie à ne point croire ce qu'ils voyent, &amp; à tâcher de deviner ce qu'ils ne voyent point, &amp; cette condition n'est pas, ce me semble, trop à envier. Sur cela je me figure toûjours que la Nature est un grand Spectacle qui ressemble à celuy de l'Opera. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Du lieu où vous estes à l'Opera, vous ne voyez pas le Theatre tout-à-fait comme ils sont</span></span>; on les a disposez pour faire de loin un effet agréable, &amp; on cache à vostre veuë ces roües &amp; ces contrepoids qui font tous les mouvemens. Aussi ne vous embarrassez-vous guere de deviner comment tout cela joüe. Il n'y a peut-estre que quelque Machiniste caché dans le Parterre, qui s'inquiete d'un Vol qui luy aura paru extraordinaire, &amp; qui veut absolument démêler comment ce Vol a esté exécuté. Vous voyez bien que ce Machiniste-là est assez fait comme les Philosophes. Mais ce qui à l'égard des Philosophes augmente la difficulté, c'est que dans les Machines que la Nature presente à nos yeux, les cordes sont parfaitement bien cachées, &amp; elles le sont si bien, qu'on a esté long-temps à deviner ce qui causoit les mouvemens de l'Univers; car representez-vous tous les Sages à l'Opera, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">ces Pythagores, ces Platons, ces Aristotes, &amp; tous ces Gens dont le nom fait aujourd'huy tant de bruit dans nos oreilles</span></span>. Suposons qu'ils voyoient le Vol de Phaëton que les Vents enlevent, qu'ils ne pouvoyent découvrir les cordes, &amp; qu'ils ne sçavoyent point comment le derriere du Theatre estoit disposé. L'un d'eux disoit: C'est une certaine Vertu secrete qui enleve Phaëton. L'autre, Phaëton est composé de certains Nombres qui le font monter. L'autre, Phaëton a une certaine amitié pour le haut du Theatre; il n'est point à son aise quand il n'y est pas. L'autre, Phaëton n'estoit pas fait pour voler, mais il aime mieux voler que de laisser le haut du Theatre vuide; &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">cent autres resveries, que je m'étonne qui n'ayent perdu de réputation toute l'Antiquité</span></span>. A la fin Descartes, &amp; quelques aut<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">res Modernes</span></span> sont venus, qui ont dit: Phaëton monte, parce qu'il est tiré par des cordes, &amp; qu'un poids plus pesant que luy, descend. Ainsi on ne croit plus qu'un corps se remue, s'il n'est poussé par un autre corps; &amp; en quelque façon tiré par des cordes; ne croit plus qu'il monte ou qu'il descende, si ce n'est par l'effet d'un contrepoids, ou d'un ressort; &amp; qui verroit la Nature telle qu'elle est, ne verroit que le derriere du Theatre de l'Opera. A ce compte, dit la Marquise, la Philosophie est devenuë bien méchanique? Si méchanique, répondis-je, que je crains qu'on en ait bien-tost honte. On veut que l'Univers ne soit en grand, que ce qu'une Montre est en petit, &amp; que tout s'y conduise par des mouvemens reglez qui dépendent de l'arangement des parties. Avoüez la verité. N'avez-vous point eu quelquefois une idée plus sublime de l'Univers, &amp; ne luy avez-vous point fait plus d'honneur qu'il ne meritoit? J'ay vû des gens qui l'en estimoyent moins, depuis qu'ils l'avoyent connu. Et moy, repliqua-t-elle, je l'en estime beaucoup plus, depuis que je sçay qu'il ressemble à une Montre. Il est surprenant que l'ordre de la Nature, tout admirable qu'il est, ne roule que sur des choses si simples. </p><p>P005: Je ne sçay pas, luy répondis-je, qui vous a donné des idées si saines; mais en verité, il n'est pas trop commun de les avoir. Assez de Gens ont toûjours dans la teste un faux Merveilleux envelopé d'une obscurité qu'ils respectent. Ils n'admirent la Nature que parce qu'ils la croyent une espece de Magie où l'on n'entend rien, &amp; il est seur qu'une chose est deshonorée auprés d'eux, dés qu'elle peut estre conceüe. Mais, Madame, continuay-je, vous estes si bien disposée à entrer dans tout ce que je veux vous dire, que je croy que je n'ay qu'à tirer le rideau, &amp; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">à vous montrer le Monde</span></span>.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret. When I thus found my self so far ingag'd that I could not retreat, and had a mind to speak, I knew not whence to begin my Discourse; for with such a person that knew nothing of Natural Philosophy, it was requisite to go far about to make her apprehend that the Earth might be a Planet, and every Star a World. So that I e'n told her again, it were much better to talk of trifles, as every reasonable person, were they in our place, would do. But at last, to give her a general Notion of Philosophy, I began with her thus. All Philosophy, said I, is grounded on these two things, the Curiosity of our Minds, and the Shortness of our Sight: For if you could see better than you do, you would discern whether those Stars are Worlds or not Worlds, and on the other hand, if you were less curious, you would not care two pence to know whether they were so or not: but we are willing to know more than we can see, and there's the difficulty. Again, if we could rightly discern what we see, we might be said to be so far knowing; but the mischief is, we see things otherways than they really are; so that true Philosophers spend their days in not believing what they see, and in studying to divine of what they see not, a condition, in my opinion, not much to be envyed. From hence I frame an Idea to my self, that Nature is but a great shew, resembling that of an Opera; from the place where you are seated at an Opera, you see not the Theatre such as it really is; 'tis disposed to give a delightful prospect at a distance, and all the Wheels and Weights that cause the movements are not in view: nor do you much concern your self to know how all is perform'd. Some Machinist might possibly lurk in the Pit, who would beat his brains about a Turn that seem'd extraordinary, and would venture absolutely to unriddle the whole contrivance of it, and this Machinist you may well resemble to the Philosophers; but that which among Philosophers augments the difficulty is, that in the Machines which Nature offers to our view, the Cords are so wholly and entirely abscond, that it has been the study of many days to resolve, from whence proceed the motions of the Universe: For imagine with your self all those Sages at an Opera, those Pythagorases Plato's, Aristotles; and all that learned crew, that at this day make so great a noise in the World, that they were Spectators of the flight of Phaeton, born upon the Wings of the Wind, and that they could not discover the Cords, nor know any thing how the back part of the Theatre was disposed: One of them would say; 'Tis some occult quality that bears up Phaeton. Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity: at last comes Descartes and some other of later days, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected. But, Madam said I, I find you so well dispos'd to enter upon what I am about to discourse to you, that I think I need do no more than draw the Curtain, and shew you the World.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P003: I defended my self in this manner for a time, but was forc'd to yield; at least I made her promise, that for my Reputation sake she would keep my secret.

Another, Phaeton is compos'd of certain Numbers that make him mount. Another, Phaeton has a certain natural Propensity to the top of the Theatre, he is not at rest unless he be there. Another, Phaeton is not made to fly, but he had rather fly than a vacuity in the top of the Theatre, and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">a thousand other extravagancies, that I admire have not blasted the Reputation of Antiquity</span></span>: at last comes<span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\"> Descartes and some other of later days</span></span>, who say, that Phaeton mounts, because he is drawn by Cords, and that a Weight more heavy than he descends. So that 'tis no longer believ'd that a body moves, unless it be by impulse from another body, and as it were drawn by Cords; nor that it ascends or descends, but by some counterpoise or spring; and he that would see Nature such as really she is, ought to look behind the Theatre. By this Account, says the Marchioness, Philosophy is become very mechanique. So mechanique, said I, that I fear we shall e're long be asham'd of it. Some will have it, that the Universe is in great, that which a Watch is in little, and that all is wrought by regular movements that depend upon the disposal of the several parts. Now confess the truth, have not you sometimes had Notions of the Universe more sublime than this? and have you not done it more honour than it deserv'd? I have met with some, who after knowing it esteem'd it less. And I, says the Marchioness, esteem it much more, since I find it resembled to a Watch. 'Tis a thing to me most surprizing, that the Order of Nature, so admirable as it is, should depend upon things so simple. I know not, said I, where you met with Notions so sound, but I assure you they are not common; We shall daily meet with people that have in their heads a false kind of Wonder involv'd in Clouds which they respect; they admire Nature only because they believe it a kind of Magick, where nothing is understood: and 'tis most certain, that whatsoever is once comprehended, is with them presently disrespected.

La Geometrie, selon ce que vous me dites, demanderoit une ame plus interessée que je ne l'ay, &amp; la Poësie en demanderoit une plus tendre, mais j'ay autant de loisir que l'Astronomie en peut demander. Heureusement encore nous sommes à la campagne, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">&amp; nous y menons quasi une vie pastorale</span></span>; tout cela convient à l'Astronomie. Ne vous y trompez pas, Madame, repris-je. Ce n'est pas la vraye vie pastorale que de parler des Planetes &amp; des Etoiles Fixes. Voyez si c'est à cela que les Gens de l'Astrée passent leur temps. Oh! répondit-elle, cette sorte de bergerie-là est trop dangereuse. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">J'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens dont vous me parliez</span></span>; recommencez un peu, s'il vous plaist, à me parler Caldéen. Quand on eut reconnu cette disposition des Cieux que vous m'avez dite, de quoy fut-il question? Il fut question, repris-je, de deviner comment toutes les parties de l'Univers devoyent estre arrangées, &amp; c'est-là ce que les Sçavans appellent faire un Sistême. Mais avant que je vous explique le premier des Sistêmes, il faut que vous remarquiez, s'il vous plaist, que nous sommes tous faits naturellement comme un certain Fou Athenien dont vous avez entendu parler, qui s'estoit mis dans la fantaisie, que tous les Vaisseaux qui abordoient au Port de Pirée, luy appartenoient. nostre folie à nous autres, est de croire aussi que toute la Nature sans exception est destinée à nos usages, &amp; quand on demande à nos Philosophes à quoy sert ce nombre prodigieux d'Etoiles Fixes, dont une petite partie suffiroit pour faire ce qu'elles font toutes, ils vous répondent froidement qu'elles servent à leur réjoüir la veüe. Sur ce principe on ne manqua pas d'abord de s'imaginer qu'il falloit que la Terre fust en repos au centre de l'Univers, tandis que tous les Corps Celestes qui estoient faits pour elle, prendroient la peine de tourner alentour pour l'éclairer. Ce fut donc au dessus de la Terre qu'on plaça la Lune, &amp; au-dessus de la Lune, on plaça Mercure, ensuite Vénus, le Soleil, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne. Au dessus de tout cela estoit le Ciel des Etoiles fixes. La Terre se trouvoit justement au milieu des Cercles que décrivent ces Planetes, &amp; ces Cercles estoient plus grands, plus ils estoient éloignez de la Terre, &amp; par consequent les Planetes plus éloignées employoient plus de temps à faire leur cours, ce qui effectivement est vray. Mais je ne sçay pas, interrompit la Marquise, pourquoy vous n'approuvez pas cet ordre-là dans l'Univers: il me paroist aussi net qu'intelligible, &amp; pour moy je vous declare que je m'en contente. Je puis me vanter, repliquay-je, que je vous adoucis bien tout ce Sistême. Si je vous le donnois tel qu'il a esté conçû par Ptolomée son Auteur, ou par ceux qui y ont travaillé aprés luy, il vous jetteroit dans une épouvante horrible. Comme les mouuemens des Planetes ne sont pas si reguliers, qu'elles n'aillent tantost plus viste, tantost plus lentement, tantost en un sens, tantost en un autre, &amp; qu'elles ne soient quelquefois plus éloignées de la Terre, quelquefois plus proches, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">les Anciens avoyent imaginé je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand</span></span>, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de meilleur, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">un Roy d'Aragon, grand Mathematicien, mais apparemment fort peu devot, disoit que si Dieu l'eust appellé à son Conseil quand il fit le Monde, il luy eust donné de bons avis</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">La pensée est trop libertine</span></span>, mais cela mesme est assez plaisant, que ce Sistême fust alors une occasion de peché, parce qu'il estoit trop confus. Les bons avis que ce Roy voulait donner, regardoient, sans doute, la suppression de tous ces Cercles, dont on avoit embarrassé les mouvemens celestes. Apparemment ils regardoient aussi celle de deux ou trois Cieux superflus qu'on avoit mis au-delà des Etoiles Fixes. Ces Philosophes pour expliquer une sorte de mouvement dans les Corps celestes, faisoient au-delà du dernier Ciel que nous voyons, un Ciel de cristal, qui imprimoit ce mouvement aux Cieux inferieurs. Avoyent-ils nouvelle d'un autre mouvement; c'estoit aussi-tost un autre Ciel de cristal. Enfin les Cieux de cristal ne leur coûtoient rien. Et pourquoy ne les faisoit-on les Cieux que de cristal, dit la Marquise? N'eussent-ils pas esté bons de quelque autre matiere? Non, répondis-je, il faloit que la lumiere passast au travers, &amp; d'ailleurs il faloit que le Cieux fussent solides. Il le faloit absolument, car Aristote avoit trouvé que la solidité estoit une chose attachée à la noblesse de leur nature; &amp; puis qu'il l'avoit dit, on n'avoit garde d'en vouloir douter. Mais on a veu des Cometes qui estant plus élevées qu'on ne croyoit autrefois, briseroient tout le cristal des Cieux par où elles passent, et casseroient tout l'Univers, &amp; il a falu se resoudre à faire les Cieux d'une matiere fluide. Enfin il est hors de doute par les Observàtions de ces derniers siecles, que Venus &amp; Mercure tournent autour du Soleil, &amp; non autour de la Terre, &amp; l'ancien Sistême est absolument insoûtenable par cet endroit. Je vais donc vous en proposer un qui satisfait à tout, &amp; qui mettroit le Roy d'Aragon hors d'estat de donner des avis, car il est d'une simplicité charmante, &amp; qui seule le feroit préferer. Il sembleroit, interrompit la Marquise, que vostre Philosophie est une espece d'enchere, où ceux qui offrent de faire les choses à moins de frais, l'emportent sur les autres. Il est vray, repris-je, &amp; ce n'est que par là qu'on peut attraper le Plan sur lequel la Nature a fait son Ouvrage. Elle est d'une épargne extraordinaire; tout ce qu'elle pourra faire d'une maniere qui luy coûtera un peu moins, quand ce moins ne seroit presque rien, soyez seure qu'elle ne le fera que de cette maniere-là. Cette épargne neanmoins s'accorde avec une magnificence surprenante qui brille dans tout ce qu'elle a fait. C'est que la magnificence est dans le dessein, &amp; l'épargne dans l'execution. Il n'y a rien de plus beau qu'un grand dessein que l'on execute à peu de frais. Nous autres, nous sommes sujets à renverser souvent tout cela dans nos idées. Nous mettons l'épargne dans le dessein qu'a eu la Nature, &amp; la magnificence dans l'execution. Nous luy donnons un petit dessein, qu'elle execute avec dix fois plus de dépense qu'il ne faudroit, cela est tout-à-fait ridicule. Je serai bien-aise, dit-elle, que le Sistême dont vous m'allez parler, imite de fort prés la Nature, car ce grand ménage-là tournera au profit de mon imagination, qui n'aura pas tant de peine à comprendre ce que vous me direz. Il n'y a plus icy d'embaras inutiles, repris-je. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">Figurez-vous un Allemand nommé Copernic, qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens</span></span>, &amp; sur tous ces Cieux solides qui avoyent esté imaginez par l'Antiquité.

Les Planetes ne tournent plus autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'enferment plus au milieu du Cercle qu'elles décrivent. Si elles nous éclairent, c'est en quelque sorte par hazard, &amp; parce qu'elles nous rencontrent en leur chemin. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil</span></span>; la Terre y tourne elle-mesme, &amp; pour la punir du long repos qu'elle s'estoit attribué, Copernic la charge le plus qu'il peut de tous les mouvemens qu'elle donnoit aux Planetes &amp; aux Cieux. Enfin de tout cet équipage celeste dont cette petite Terre se faisoit accompagner &amp; environner, il ne luy est demeuré que la Lune qui tourne encore autour d'elle. Attendez un peu, dit la Marquise, il vient de vous prendre un enthousiasme qui vous a fait expliquer les choses si pompeusement, que je ne croy pas les avoir entenduës. Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, &amp; là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure &amp; Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, &amp; vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, &amp; ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, &amp; si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.</p>","manualHtml":"<p>P005: I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, where we lead a kind of Pastoral life agreeable to that study. Do not deceive your self, Madam, said I, that's not the true pastoral life, to discourse of Planets and fixed Stars. Do you find that the People of Astrea past their time that way? Oh! says she, that sort of Shepherdise is too dangerous: I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans; pray, if you please, begin and speak Chaldee to me. When that Order and Disposition of the Heavens, which you tell me of, is known, where's the Question? The Question is, said I, to find how all the parts of the Universe ought to be ranged; and that's it which the Learned call framing of a System. But before I explain to you the first System, you must take notice, if you please, that naturally we are all like that Fool of Athens, whom you have heard spoke of, who had a fancy that all the Ships in the Port of Pireum were his. 'Tis just so our folly to persuade our selves that all Nature was design'd for our use, and when we ask our Philosophers, to what end is all that prodigious number of fixed Stars, when a few would suffice to perform the office of all? they'l answer jejunely, that they are to delight the Eye. Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles to salve those extravagant Appearances. So great was the intricacy of those Circles, that then when men knew no better, it was said by a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better. 'Twas the expression of a Libertine; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. All turns now about the Sun, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P005: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">I am very well satisfy'd, said the Marchioness, that I have learn'd this Geneology of the Sciences</span></span> and I find I must keep close to Astronomy, Geometry and Poetry, according to what you say, will require the one a more interested, and the other a more tender soul than mine is, but I have all the leasure that is requisite in Astronomy, and happy it is likewise that we are in the country, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">where we lead a kind of Pastoral life</span></span> agreeable to that study.

Upon this principle it was believ'd, that the Earth rests quiet in the center of the Universe, while all the celestial bodies, which were made for it, take the pains to roll about and inlighten it. 'Twas then next above the the Earth that they plac'd the Moon, above the Moon Mercury; next Venus, the Sun, Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, and above all these the Orb of the fixed Stars. The Earth was seated just in the middle of these Circles describ'd by the Planets, and the greater those Circles were, the more distant they were from the Earth, and consequently the most distant Planets imployed more time in performing their Course, which is in effect true. But I know not, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, why you should not approve of that Order of the Universe, to me it seems as decent as intelligible; and for my own share, I declare I am well satisfied with it. I can boast, said I, that I have much qualify'd that whole System; for should I have represented it to you, such as it was at first fram'd by Ptolomy the Author, it would have astonish'd you. The motions of the Planets being not so regular, but that they went sometime faster, sometime slower, sometime to one side, sometime to another, sometime farther off, sometime near the Earth; <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">the Ancients imagin'd a strange Labyrinth of Circles</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">to salve those extravagant Appearances</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">So great was the intricacy of those Circles</span></span>, that then when men knew no better, it was said by <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">a King of Arragon, a great Mathematician, but something irreligious, That if he had been of God Almightys Council when he made the World, he would have advised him better</span></span>. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"7\">'Twas the expression of a Libertine</span></span>; but pleasant enough, that at that time the great confusion of that System was the occasion of a sin. The Advice the King would have given was doubtless the suppressing of all those Circles that had caused so much intricacy in the celestial motions; and 'tis most certain, he meant the same likewise of those three superfluous Heavens that are plac'd beyond the fixed Stars. The Philosophers, to explicate one sort of motion of the celestial bodies, framed, beyond the utmost Heaven that we see, a Heaven of Crystal, which gave the first impulse of motion to the inferiour Orbs. If they discover'd any thing of another motion, they had presently another Crystalline Heaven ready at hand; for Heavens of Crystal in those days cost them little or nothing. But why, said the Marchioness, did they still make them of Crystal? Would not some other material have done as well? By no means, said I, it was requisite they should be transparent, to give way to the passage of Light, and it was absolutely necessary they should be solid; for Aristotle had found that Solidity was a thing affix'd to the Nobility of their Nature; and when he once said it, it was no longer to be doubted. But since Comets have been observed to rise higher than heretofore it was believed, it was fear'd that in their passage they might hazard the cracking of those Crystalline Heavens, and break the World about our ears: therefore it has been thought more convenient to make them of a more fluid matter. In fine, it is now a thing undoubted by the Observations of later Ages, that Venus and Mercury move about the Sun, and not about the Earth, and that the ancient System is not at all tenable. But I am now going to propose another to you, which will satisfy in all points, and save the King of Arragon the trouble of his Advice; it is of a most charming simplicity, which alone ought to give it the preference. I see, says the Marchioness, that Philosophy is a kind of Chaffering, where they that ask cheapest shall have your Work before another. 'Tis very true, said I, and that's the only way to trace out the Works of Nature; she's hugely provident, and whatever she can do in such a way as may cost her little or nothing, to be sure she will do it that way, rather than another; yet this Providence agrees well with a surprizing Magnificence that is illustrious in all her actions; that is, there is Magnificence in the Design, and a sparing Providence in the Execution. There is nothing more commendable, than a great Design managed with a little Charge; but we frame our Idea's wholly to the contrary, and place the Frugality of Nature in the Design, and the Magnificence in the Execution; we represent her carrying on a small inconsiderable Design, with ten times more Charge than needs, which is ridiculous. I shall be very well pleas'd, said the Marchioness, that the System you tell me of may be a perfect imitation of Nature; for that Parcimony will be much in favour of my imagination, which will have less trouble in comprehending what you tell me. You will there, said I, meet with no unnecessary difficulties, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"8\">represent only to your self a certain German call'd Copernicus, who pull'd down all those different Circles</span></span> and solid Heavens that were set up by Antiquity; he destroys the one, and breaks the other in pieces, and, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"9\">possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury</span></span>, he takes the Earth and throws it out of the center of the World, where it had long been fixt, and in the place of it puts the Sun, as much more deserving of that Honour; the Planets turn no more about the Earth, nor circumscribe her in their Circles; if they inlighten us, 'tis in a manner only by chance, and as we meet them on the road. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"10\">All turns now about the Sun</span></span>, even the Earth it self, and to chastise her for her long idle repose, Copernicus charges her as near as he can with all those motions she before impos'd upon the Planets and Heavens. And in fine, of all that bright Equipage which attended and surrounded this little spot of Earth, no more remains but the Moon which still rolls about her. Hold a little, says the Marchioness, you are fallen into an Enthusiasm, and explain things in so pompous a manner, that I know not whether I rightly understand them. The Sun, you say, is in the Center of the World, and there remains immoveable; pray what follows next? 'Tis Mercury, says I, he turns about the Sun, so that the Sun is the Center of that Circle describ'd by Mercury. Above Mercury is Venus, which likewise turns about the Sun. Next follows the Earth, which being above Mercury and Venus, describes about the Sun a Circle greater than theirs. Then follow Mars, Iupiter and Saturn in the order I have told you, and you may perceive that Saturn ought to describe about the Sun the greatest Circle of all, and he likewise is longer than any other Planet in performing his Revolution. And what, says she, becomes of the Moon? you forget her. I'l meet her again, said I, easy enough; she keeps close to the Earth, and forsakes her not, but as the Earth advances daily in the Circle which she describes about the Sun; the Moon follows in her daily course about the Earth; so that if the Moon turn about the Sun, 'tis only because she will not forsake the Earth.</p>","explanations":["The French 'Je suis bien-aise' (I am glad) has been translated as 'I am very well satisfy'd', making explicit a stronger degree of satisfaction than was implied in the original.","The French 'quasi une vie pastorale' (almost a pastoral life) is translated as 'a kind of Pastoral life', which explicitly identifies the nature of the similarity, making the implicit comparison more definite.","The French 'j'aime mieux celles de ces Chaldéens' (I prefer those of the Chaldeans) is translated as 'I rather fancy that of the Chaldeans', where 'fancy' makes explicit the nature of the preference as being a matter of personal taste or imagination.","The French 'je ne sçay combien de Cercles differemment entrelassez les uns dans les autres' (I don't know how many circles differently interlaced with each other) is translated as 'a strange Labyrinth of Circles', explicitly characterizing the complexity as a 'labyrinth', which was only implied in the original.","The French 'L'embaras de tous ces Cercles estoit si grand' (The confusion of all these circles was so great) is translated as 'So great was the intricacy of those Circles', where 'intricacy' makes explicit the nature of the confusion, implying a complex interconnection.","The French 'par lesquels ils sauvoyent toutes ces bizarreries' (by which they saved all these oddities) is translated as 'to salve those extravagant Appearances', making explicit that these were 'appearances' that needed to be 'salvaged' or explained away, adding clarification about the astronomical context.","The French 'apparemment fort peu devot' (apparently very little devout) is translated as 'something irreligious', which makes the implicit criticism of religious deviation more explicit.","The French 'La pensée est trop libertine' (The thought is too libertine) is translated as ''Twas the expression of a Libertine', which makes explicit that it's the person who is being characterized as libertine rather than just the thought itself.","The French 'qui fait main-basse sur tous ces Cercles differens' (who puts down/slashes all these different circles) is translated as 'who pull'd down all those different Circles', making explicit the destructive action with the more concrete 'pulled down'.","The French 'Saisi d'une noble fureur d'Astronome' (Seized with a noble fury of an Astronomer) is translated as 'possess'd with a noble Astronomical fury', where 'possess'd' makes the intensity of the passion more explicit than the original 'seized'.","The French 'Tout tourne presentement autour du Soleil' (Everything turns presently around the Sun) is translated as 'All turns now about the Sun', where 'now' makes explicit the contrast with the previous system that was just described."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P008: <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Je vous entends, répondit-elle, &amp; j'aime la Lune, de nous estre restée, lors que toutes les autres Planetes nous abandonoient</span></span>.

Have you observ'd, said I, that a Bowl running upon the earth has two motions? it moves towards the end of its course where it is directed, and at the same time turns it self many times about, so that the upper parts descend and those below ascend; the Earth does the like: While she advances in her annual Circle about the Sun, she turns about her self in four and twenty hours; so that in four and twenty hours every part of the Earth loses and recovers the Sun; and as we turn toward that side where the Sun is, he seems to rise, and as we begin to remove from him, he seems to descend.

Just so the Earth. which is solid enough, is cover'd from the surface about twenty leagues high at most, with a kind of Down, which is the Air; This and all the other Cod of the Silkworm turns at the same time. Beyond the Air is the Celestial matter incomparably more pure, more subtil, and likewise more in motion than it. You give me, said the Marchioness, Idea's of the Earth contemptible enough; is it then upon this shell of a Silkworm that we labour and toil, and fight, and make such a noise on all hands as we do? 'Tis even so, said I, and in the mean time Nature that takes no notice of those little tle particular motions, carrys us altogether with one general movement, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">and sports her self with the lit-Ball.</span></span> To me, says she, it seems something ridiculous to be seated upon a thing that turns? and torment ones self so much; but the mischief is, we are not fully assur'd that we turn; for to tell you truth, notwithstanding all those precautions you have us'd, that a man should not perceive the motion of the Earth, I am still very doubtful.

I observe, said I, that you have still a good thought for the Moon, which you cannot part with. The Light is composed of little Balls, that rebound from any thing that is solid, whereas they pass in a straight line through any thing that opens to them, as the Air, or Glass. So that hence it is that the Moon gives us Light, because she is a hard solid body that reflects those little Balls upon us. Now I believe you will not at all contest the solidity of the Earth. Admire then what it is to be advantagiously plac'd. The Moon being so far distant from us, we only behold it as a luminous body, and know not that 'tis a great mass like the Earth. On the contrary, because the Earth has the ill luck to be seen by us near at hand, she appears to us a great mass fit for nothing but to feed Cattel, and cannot discern that she is luminous, because we cannot set our selves at distance enough from her. Just so, said she, we are dazl'd with the lustre of Conditions more elevated than our own, and never discern that in the bottom they are extremely alike.</p> <p>P020: 'Tis even so, said I we would judge of all, but are still ill placed to take our view; in judging of our selves we are too near, and in judging of others too far off. The middle place between the Moon and the Earth is the best to take a right prospect of both; and better it would be, to be simply a Spectator of the World than an Inhabitant. I shall never be comforted, says she, for the Injustice we do the Earth, and our too much partiality to the Moon, unless you assure me that the people of the Moon, have no more knowledge of their Advantages than we have of ours, and that they take our Earth for a Star, without knowing that their own Habitation is so likewise. I'le warrant you for that, said I, we appear to them to perform our function of a Star regularly enough: 'tis true they do not see us describe a Circle about them; but 'tis no matter, the thing is this; The half of the Moon which was turn'd towards us at the beginning of the World, has continued so ever since, she still shews the same Eyes, the same Mouth, and all the rest of the Face, which those Spots we discern in her, frame in our Imagination; if we saw the other half, other kind of Spots, in different posture, would doubtless create in our Imagination other kind of Figures. 'Tis not that the Moon does not turn about her self, 'tis certain she turns in just so much time as she turns about the Earth, that is, in a month. But when she has made one part of that turn about her self, and that she ought to hide, for example, one Cheek of that pretended Face from us, and appear some other thing, she makes the like part of her Circle about the Earth, and putting her self in a new point of sight, shews us still the same Cheek. So that the Moon, that in respect of the Sun and other Stars, turns about her self, in respect of us turns not all.

Now I believe you will not at all contest the solidity of the Earth. Admire then what it is to be advantagiously plac'd.

I shall never be comforted, says she, for the Injustice we do the Earth, and our too much partiality to the Moon, unless you assure me that the people of the Moon, have no more knowledge of their Advantages than we have of ours, and that they take our Earth for a Star, without knowing that their own Habitation is so likewise. I'le warrant you for that, said I, we appear to them to perform our function of a Star regularly enough: 'tis true they do not see us describe a Circle about them; but 'tis no matter, the thing is this; The half of the Moon which was turn'd towards us at the beginning of the World, has continued so ever since, she still shews the same Eyes, the same Mouth, and all the rest of the Face, which those Spots we discern in her, frame in our Imagination; if we saw the other half, other kind of Spots, in different posture, would doubtless create in our Imagination other kind of Figures. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">'Tis not that the Moon does not turn about her self, 'tis certain she turns in just so much time as she turns about the Earth, that is, in a month.</span></span> But when she has made one part of that turn about her self, and that she ought to hide, for example, one Cheek of that pretended Face from us, and appear some other thing, she makes the like part of her Circle about the Earth, and putting her self in a new point of sight, shews us still the same Cheek. So that the Moon, that in respect of the Sun and other Stars, turns about her self, in respect of us turns not all.

Je croy que l'Arioste les met toutes en un tas, mais j'aime mieux me figurer qu'elles sont rangées bien proprement dans de longues Galeries. Astolphe fut fort étonné de voir que les Phioles de beaucoup de Gens qu'il avoit crus tres-sages, estoient pourtant bien pleines, &amp; pour moy je suis persuadé que la mienne s'est remplie considerablement depuis que je vous entretiens de Visions, tantost Philosophiques, tantost Poëtiques, mais ce qui me console, c'est qu'il n'est pas possible que par tout ce que je vous dis, je ne vous fasse avoir bientost aussi une petite Phiole dans la Lune.

Je ne me plaindrois pas de cette perte-la, pourveu qu'elle n'allast pas plus loin, mais s'il faut que la chose continuë comme elle a commencé, je n'ay qu'à m'attendre à devenir tel que j'ay décrit Roland.

Were there none but you, Madam, said I, all those that have been address'd to you, are fled thither, and they are enough to make a considerable body. In fine, the Moon is so exact in collecting all that is lost here below, that all is to be found there, even to the Donation of Constantine, but this Ariosto tells you in your ear. The thing is, the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters of Rome and Italy by vertue of a Donation from the Emperour Constantine, and the truth is, no man knows what's become of it. But guess you what sort of thing is to be found in the Moon. Folly. All that has ever been upon the face of the Earth, is there carefully preserv'd. It is not credible how many lost Wits are in the Moon. They are so many Phiols full of a most subtil Liquor, which easily evaporates, unless the Phiol be close stop'd, and upon every Phiol is written the Name of him to whom the Wit belongs. Ariosto sets them altogether: but I chuse rather to represent to my self, that they are rang'd in good order in a long Gallery. Astolphus was much amaz'd to find that the Phiols of many, whom he always thought very wise, were very full; and for own part, I believe that my own is grown pretty full since I entertain'd you with Visions, sometime Philosophical, sometime Poetical; but that which comforts me, is, that 'tis not impossible but that in all that I say to you, I shall procure you likewise a little Phiol in the Moon e're it be long. The good Paladin fail'd not to find his own there among the rest, and presently laying hold on't, with permission of St. Iohn, he snuffed it up at his nose, like the Queen of Hungaries Water, but Ariosto says that he carried it not far, but let it return again to the Moon by a Folly he committed sometime after. However he forgot not the Phiol of Roland, which was the business of his journey, and he had trouble enough in carrying it; for the Wit of that Hero was very heavy, and there was not a drop wanting. In fine, Ariosto, according to his laudable custom of saying what he pleases, makes this Apostrophe to his Mistress, in excellent Verse. Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable. When we go to some Lands newly discover'd, we find the Inhabitants scarce Men; they are a sort of Animals in humane shape, and sometime imperfect enough, but almost wholly without reason: therefore surely he that should go on to the Moon, would not find them Men at all.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P030: As for the Sighs of Lovers, said the Marchioness, interrupting me, I know not whether in the days of Ariosto they were lost or not, but now adays I know none that go to the Moon.

Who, my Fair one, shall mount up to Heaven to bring back my Wits lost by your Charms? I should not lament the loss, provided they were gone no further; but if matters continue as they have begun, I must expect to become even such as I have discrib'd Roland. Yet I hardly belive that to recover my Wits, it will be necessary that I travel through the Air to the Moon; my Wits are not fled so high, they are still hovering about your eyes and mouth; and if you desire I should recover them, give me leave to take them with my Lips. Is not his pretty? For my part, to argue like Ariosto, I would advise that none should ever lose their Wits but for Love; for you see they go not far, and there needs no more than a pair of Lips to recover them; but when they are lost by other means, as we, for example, lose them now in Philosophizing, they fly to the Moon, and are not to be recover'd at pleasure. To make amends, said the Marchioness, our Phiols shall be honourably set in the quarter of Philosophical Phiols; whereas otherwise perhaps our Wits might run astray here to somebody unworthy of them. But to make an end of losing mine, pray tell me, and tell me very seriously, whether you think that there are Men in the Moon or not; for hitherto you have not discours'd to me of of any thing positively enough. Who I? says I, I do not at all believe there are Men in the Moon. Do but observe how the face of Nature is chang'd in the distance between this and China; you find other Faces, other Figures, other Manners and almost other principles of Reason; and certainly in such a distance as between this and the Moon, the change ought to be much more considerable. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">When we go to some Lands newly discover'd, we find the Inhabitants scarce Men</span></span>; they are a sort of Animals in humane shape, and sometime imperfect enough, but almost wholly without reason: therefore surely he that should go on to the Moon, would not find them Men at all.</p>","explanations":["The French text states 'les Papes ont prétendu estre Maistres' (the Popes have claimed to be Masters), while the English translation makes this more explicit as 'the Popes that have pretended themselves Masters', adding the reflexive 'themselves' to emphasize the Pope's agency in making this claim, thereby making the implicit criticism more explicit.","The French text describes Roland's spirit/wit as 'de sa nature assez pesant' (by its nature rather heavy), while the English translation simplifies this to 'was very heavy', making explicit that the heaviness is an inherent quality rather than preserving the more nuanced 'by its nature' phrasing.","The French text uses a more impersonal construction 'Quand on va vers' (When one goes toward) and 'à peine sont-ce des Hommes' (they are barely men), while the English translation makes this more direct with 'When we go' and 'we find the Inhabitants scarce Men', explicitly identifying the narrator and audience as the observers/judges of these newly discovered peoples."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P036: Quelles sortes de Gens seroient-ce donc, reprit la Marquise, avec un air d'impatience?

Je gage que je vais vous reduire à avoüer contre toute raison, qu'il pourra y avoir un jour du commerce entre la Terre &amp; la Lune. Remettez-vous dans l'esprit l'estat où estoit l'Amerique avant qu'elle eust esté découverte par Christophle Colomb. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Ses Habitans vivoient dans une ignorance extrême</span></span>. Loin de connoistre les Sciences, ils ne connoissoient pas les Arts les plus simples, &amp; les plus necessaires. Ils alloient nuds, ils n'avoient point d'autres armes que l'Arc, ils n'avoient jamais conçeu que des hommes peussent estre portez par des Animaux; ils regardoient la Mer comme un grand espace défendu aux hommes, qui se joignoit au Ciel, &amp; au-delà duquel il n'y avoit rien. Il est vray qu'aprés avoir passé des années entieres à creuser le tronc d'un gros arbre avec des pierres tranchantes, ils se mettoient sur la Mer dans ce tronc, &amp; alloient terre à terre portez par le vent &amp; par les flots. Mais comme ce Vaisseau estoit sujet à estre souvent renversé, il faloit qu'ils se missent aussi-tost à la nage pour le rattraper, &amp; à proprement parler, ils nageoient toûjours, horsmis le temps qu'ils s'y délassoient. Qui leur eust dit qu'il y avoit une sorte de Navigation incomparablement plus parfaite, qu'on pouvait traverser cette étendue infinie d'eaux de tel costé &amp; de tel sens qu'on vouloit, qu'on s'y pouvoit arrester sans mouvement au milieu des Flots émeus; qu'on estoit maistre de la vitesse avec laquelle on alloit; qu'enfin cette Mer quelque vaste qu'elle fust, n'estoit point un obstacle à la communication des Peuples, pourveu seulement qu'il y eust des Peuples au delà, vous pouvez conter qu'ils ne l'eussent jamais creu. Cependant voilà un beau jour, le Spectacle du monde le plus étrange &amp; le moins atténdu qui se presente à eux. De grands Corps énormes qui paroissent avoir des aîles blanches, qui volent sur la Mer, qui vomissent du feu de toutes parts, &amp; qui viennent jeter sur le rivage des Gens inconnus tout écaillez de fer, disposant comme ils veulent de Monstres qui courent sous eux, &amp; tenant en leur main des Foudres dont ils terrassent tout ce qui leur resiste. D'où sont-ils venus? Qui a pû les amener par dessus les Mers? Qui a mis le feu en leur disposition? Sont-ce des Dieux? Sont-ce les Enfans du Soleil? Car assurément ce ne sont pas des hommes. Je ne sçais, Madame, si vous entrez comme moy, dans la surprise des Ameriquains, mais jamais il ne peut y en avoir esté une égale. Après cela, je ne veux plus jurer qu'il ne puisse y avoir commerce quelque jour entre la Lune &amp; la Terre. Les Ameriquains eussent-ils creu qu'il y en eust dû avoir entre l'Amerique &amp; l'Europe, qu'ils ne connoissoient seulement pas? Il est vray qu'il faudra traverser <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">ce grand espace d'Air &amp; de Ciel qui est entre la Terre &amp; la Lune</span></span>; mais ces grandes Mers paroissoient-elles aux Ameriquains plus propres à estre traversées? En verité, dit la Marquise en me regardant, vous estes fou. Qui vous dit le contraire, répondis-je? Mais je veux vous le prouver, reprit-elle, je ne me contente pas de l'aveu que vous en faites. Les Ameriquains étoient si ignorans, qu'ils n'avoient garde de soupçonner qu'on pust se faire des chemins à travers des Mers si vastes; mais nous qui avons tant de connoissances, nous nous figurerions bien qu'on pust aller par les Airs, si l'on pouvoit effectivement y aller. On fait plus que se figurer la chose possible, repliquay-je, on commence déja à voler un peu; plusieurs personnes differentes ont trouvé le secret de s'ajuster <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">des aîles qui les soutiennent en l'air, de leur donner du mouvement</span></span>, &amp; de passer par dessus des Rivieres, ou de voler d'un Clocher à un autre. A la verité ce n'a pas esté un vol d'Aigle, &amp; il en a quelquefois couté à <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">ces nouveaux Oyseaux un bras ou une jambe</span></span>; mais enfin cela ne represente encore que les premieres planches que l'on ait jamais mises sur l'eau, &amp; qui ont esté le commencement de la Navigation. De ces planches là il y avoit bien loin jusqu'à de gros Navires qui pussent faire le tour du Monde. Cependant peu à peu sont venus les gros Navires. L'Art de voler ne fait encore que de naistre, il se perfectionnera, &amp; quelque jour on ira jusqu'à la Lune. Pretendons-nous avoir découvert toutes choses, ou les avoir mises à un point qu'on n'y puisse rien ajoûter? Eh! de grace, consentons qu'il y ait encore quelque chose à faire pour les Siecles à venir. Je ne consentiray point, dit-elle, qu'on vôle jamais, que d'une maniere à se rompre aussi-tost le cou. Eh bien, luy répondis-je, si vous voulez qu'on vole toûjours si mal icy, on volera mieux dans la Lune; ses Habitans seront plus propres que nous à ce Mestier; car il n'importe que nous allions là, où qu'ils viennent icy, &amp; nous serons comme les Ameriquains qui ne se figuroient pas qu'on pust naviguer, quoi qu'à l'autre bout du Monde on navigeast fort bien. Les Gens de la Lune seroient donc déja venus, reprit-elle presque en colere. Les Européens n'ont esté en Amerique qu'au bout de six mille ans, répliquay-je en éclatant de rire, il leur falut ce temps-là pour perfectionner la Navigation jusqu'au point de pouvoir traverser l'Ocean. Les <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">gens de la Lune sçavent peut-estre déja faire de petits voyages dans l'air</span></span>; à l'heure qu'il est, ils s'exercent; quand ils seront plus habiles &amp; plus experimentez, nous les verrons, &amp; Dieu sçait quelle surprise. Vous estes insuportable, dit-elle, de me pousser à bout avec un raisonnement aussi creux que celuy-là. Si vous me fâchez, repris-je, je sçay bien ce que j'ajoûteray encore pour le fortifier. Remarquez que le Monde se développe peu à peu. Les Anciens se tenoient bien seurs que la Zone Torride, &amp; les Zones Glaciales ne pouvoient être habitées à cause de l'excés ou de la chaleur, ou du froideur, &amp; du temps des Romains la Carte generale de la Terre n'estoit guere plus étenduë que la Carte de leur Empire, ce qui avoit de la grandeur en un sens, &amp; beaucoup d'ignorance en un autre. Cependant il ne laissa pas de se trouver des hommes, &amp; dans des Païs tres-chauds, &amp; dans des Païs tres-froids, Voilà déja le Monde augmenté. En suite on jugea que l'Ocean couvrait toute la Terre, hormis ce qui en estoit connu alors, &amp; qu'il n'y avoit point d'Antipodes, car on n'en avoit jamais oüy parler, &amp; puis auroient-ils eu les pieds en haut, &amp; la teste en bas? Aprés ce beau raisonnement, on découvre pourtant les Antipodes. Nouvelle reformation à la Carte, nouvelle moitié de la Terre. Vous m'entendez-bien, Madame, ces Antipodes là qu'on a trouvez contre toute esperance, devroient nous apprendre à estre retenus dans nos jugemens. Le Monde achevera peut-estre de se déveloper pour nous, on connoistra jusqu'à la Lune. Nous n'en sommes pas encore là, parce que toute la Terre n'est pas découverte, &amp; qu'apparemment il faut que tout cela se fasse d'ordre. Quand nous aurons bien connu nostre habitation, il nous sera permis de connoistre celle de nos Voisins, les Gens de la Lune. Sans mentir, dit la Marquise, en me regardant attentivement, je vous trouve si profond sur cette matiere, qu'il n'est pas possible que vous ne croyiez tout de bon ce que vous dites. J'en serois bien fâché, répondis-je, je veux seulement vous faire voir qu'on peut assez bien soûtenir une opinion chimerique, pour embarasser une personne d'esprit, mais non pas assez bien pour la persuader. Il n'y a que la verité qui persuade, mesme sans avoir besoin de paroistre avec toutes ses preuves.

I'le hold a Wager, that I'le bring you to acknowledge against all reason, that there may be in time a Commerce between the Moon and the Earth. Consider with your self the Circumstances of America, before it was discover'd by Christopher Columbus, the Inhabitants lived in the extremest Ignorance, so great strangers to knowledge, that they knew not the most simple and most necessary Arts, they went naked, had no Arms but the Bow, and could never imagine that Men could be carried by Animals; they look'd upon the Sea as a great space prohibited to Men, that it was joyn'd to the Heavens, and that beyond it was nothing. 'Tis true, after spending whole years in making hollow the Trunk of a great Tree with sharp stones, they put to Sea in that Trunk, and coasted the Shoar with Wind and Tide; but as that Vessel was often subject to overset they were as often put to swim to recover it; and, to speak properly, they constantly swam, only then when they took breath in their Boats. Whoever should have told them that there was another sort of Navigation incomparably more perfect, that men could traverse that vast extent of Waters where and how they pleas'd, that they could stop without motion in the midst of the rolling Waves, and command the swiftness of their Course; and in fine, that the Sea, vast as it is, was no obstacle to the Communication of people, provided there were people on the other side, you may well imagine they would never have believ'd it. Yet you see the time came, that the strangest Spectacle in the World, and the least expected by them, appear'd before them, huge enormous Bodies that seem'd to fly upon Sea with white Wings that vomited fire on all sides, and cast upon their Shoars an unknown sort of people clad with Iron, governing those Monsters that ran upon the Sea, as they pleas'd, and bearing Thunder in their Hands that beat down all before them. From whence come they? Who could bring them over Sea? Who put the Fire in their power? Are they Gods? Are they Children of the Sun? For certainly these are not Men. I know not, Madam, whether you conceive, as I do, the great surprize of the Americans, but certainly never any equall'd it. After all this, I will no more swear that there will not be in time a Commerce between the Moon &amp; the Earth. Could the Americans believe that ever there should be any between America and Europe, and that they alone should not know it? 'Tis true, there is a great space of Air and Heaven to be travers'd between the Earth and the Moon, but did those great Seas appear to the Americans any more fit for passage? Seriously and truly, says the Marchioness, looking upon me, you are a Fool. Who says the contrary, said I? But, says she, I'm not content with your Confession, I'le prove it to you. The Americans were so ignorant that they never minded whether those vast Seas could be passed or not, but we that are so knowing would needs imagine a passage through the Air, if it were possible to go there. A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it. Ah! says the Marchioness, you now give me some comfort; your fallacious reasoning made me sick. I am now in a better condition to go to bed and sleep quietly, if you think fit that we retire.</p>","aiHtml":"<p>P033: Oh! says she I reckon the Inhabitants of the Terra Australis as known; for 'tis certain they must needs resemble us very much, and in fine, we may know them when ever we take the pains to go see them, there they are and cannot avoid us; but the people of the Moon, we shall never know, 'tis that I despair of.

A thing possible, said I, is more than imagination; Men begin already to fly a little, several persons have found the secret of fitting themselves with <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Wings, that support and give them motion in the Air</span></span>, and they can fly over Rivers, and from Steeple to Steeple. 'Tis true, 'tis not the flight of an Eagle, and it has cost <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">those new Birds sometimes a Leg or an Arm</span></span>; but that in the mean time does but represent the first Planks that were set a sloat, and were the beginning of Navigation. There was a great distance or difference between those Planks and a great Ship that could make a Circuit about the World, yet by little and little they are grown up to a great Ship. So the Art of Flying is yet in its infancy; it will daily grow towards perfection, and sometime or other we shall get up to the Moon, Can we pretend to have discover'd all things, or to have proceeded so far that nothing is to be added? Ah! we must needs allow that there is something yet to do for the Ages to come. I will never allow, says she, that any man can fly, without breaking his neck. Well, said I, if you will have it that they fly so ill here, they'l fly better in the Moon; the people there are fitter for the Art than we, and 'tis no matter whether we go to them or they come to us, just so the Americans could not dream of the Art of Navigation, when at the other end of the World it was well understood. Why then, says she, almost angry, the people of the Moon should be already come. The Europeans, said I, ready to laugh, did not discover America till after 6000 years, so long was requisite to bring Navigation to that perfection, as to venture to pass the Ocean, the <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">people of the Moon can possibly make little voyages in the Air</span></span>, and at this hour they are exercising when they are grown more knowing and expert, we shall see them, and God knows what a surprize 'twill be. You are insufferable, said she, to conclude me with such empty Arguments. If you provoke me, said I, I know what I can yet add to confirm them. Observe that the World discloses it self by little and little; the Ancients held it for certain that the torrid and frozen Zones were not habitable, and in the time of the Romans the general Map of the Earth was not much bigger than the Map of the Empire, which had much of Greatness in one sense and Ignorance in another; in the mean time Men have been found to inhabit both in the hot and cold Climates. See there the World inlarged: So likewise it was thought that the Ocean cover'd all the Earth, but what was then known, and that there was no Antipodet; for they were never heard of; and also could they have had their Feet upward and their Head downward? After so pleasant a reasoning, the Antipodes are discover'd, and there's a new Reformation of the Map, and a new half of the World. Understand me well, Madam; Those Antipodes so discover'd beyond all expectation, ought to instruct us to be wary in our Judgment. The Discovery of the World will possibly be finished by us, and we shall know all as far as the Moon: We have not yet attain'd so far; because as yet all the Earth is not discover'd, and because all must be done in order. When we know our own habitation well, it will be allow'd us to make acquaintance with our Neighbours without lying, said the Marchioness looking attentively on me, you are so serious in this thing, that doubtless you must needs believe all you say, I should be sorry for that, said I, I would only lett you see, that a Chimerical opinion may be maintain'd well enough to confound a person of witt, but not enough to perswade 'tis only truth that perswades, and that even not without producing all its proofs, it insinuates so naturally into the mind, that <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">we seem only to remember it, though it be the first time we heard of it</span></span>.

Je ne soufriray point cela, répondit-elle. Hier vous m'aviez preparée à voir ces Gens là venir icy au premier jour, &amp; aujourd'huy ils ne seroient seulement pas au monde? Vous ne vous joüerez point ainsi de moy, vous m'avez fait croire les Habitans de la Lune; j'ay surmonté la peine que j'y avois, je les croiray. Vous allez bien vîte, repris-je, il faut ne donner que la moitié de son esprit aux choses de cette espece que l'on croit, &amp; en reserver une autre moitié libre, où le contraire puisse estre admis, s'il en est besoin. Je ne me paye point de Sentences, répliqua-t-elle, allons au fait. Ne faut-il pas raisonner de la Lune comme de Saint Denis? Non, répondis-je, la Lune ne ressemble pas autant à la Terre que Saint Denis ressemble à Paris. Le Soleil éleve de la Terre &amp; des Eaux, des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui montant en l'air jusqu'à quelque hauteur, s'y assemblent, &amp; forment les nüages. Ces nüages suspendus voltigent irregulierement autour de nostre Globe, &amp; ombragent tantost <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">un Païs</span></span>, tantost un autre. Qui verroit la Terre de loin, remarqueroit souvent quelques changemens sur sa surface, parce qu'un grand Païs couvert par des nüages, seroit un endroit obscur, &amp; deviendrait plus lumineux dés qu'il serait découvert. On verroit des taches qui changeroient de place, ou s'assembleroient diversement, ou disparoîtroient tout à fait. On verroit donc aussi ces mesmes changemens sur la face de la Lune, si elle avoit des nüages autour d'elle; mais tout au contraire, toutes ses taches sont fixes, ses endroits lumineux le sont toûjours, &amp; voila le malheur. A ce compte-là, le Soleil n'éleve point de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons de dessus la Lune. C'est donc un Corps infiniment plus dur &amp; plus solide que nostre Terre, dont les parties les plus subtiles se dégagent aisément d'avec les autres, &amp; montent en haut dés qu'elles sont mises en mouvement par la chaleur. Il faut que ce soit quelque amas de Rochers &amp; de Marbres, où il ne se fait point d'évaporations; d'ailleurs elles se font si naturellement &amp; si necessairement ou il y a des Eaux, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">qu'il ne doit point y avoir d'eaux ou il ne s'en fait point</span></span>. Qui sont donc les Habitans de ces Rochers qui ne peuvent rien produire, &amp; de ce Païs qui n'a point d'eaux? Et quoy, s'écria-t-elle, il ne vous souvient plus que vous m'avez assurée qu'il y avoit dans la Lune des Mers que l'on distinguoit d'icy? Ce n'est qu'une conjecture, répondis-je, j'en suis bien fâché; ces endroits obscurs qu'on prend pour des Mers, ne sont peut-estre que de grandes cavitez. De la distance ou nous sommes, il est permis de ne pas deviner tout à fait juste. Mais, dit-elle, cela suffira-t-il pour nous faire abandonner les Habitans de la Lune? Non pas tout à fait, Madame, répondis-je, nous ne nous déterminerons ni pour eux, ny contre eux. Je vous avouë ma faiblesse, repliqua-t-elle, je ne suis point capable d'une si parfaite indétermination, j'ay besoin de croire. Fixez-moy promptement à une opinion sur les Habitans de la Lune, conservons les, ou aneantissons les pour jamais &amp; qu'il n'en soit plus parlé; mais conservons les plûtost, s'il se peut, <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">j'ay pris pour eux une inclination</span></span> que j'aurois de la peine à perdre. Je ne laisseray donc pas la Lune deserte, repris-je, repeuplons là pour vous faire plaisir. A la verité, puisque l'apparence des taches de la Lune ne change point, on ne peut pas croire qu'elle ait des nüages autour d'elle, qui ombragent tantost une partie, tantost une autre; mais ce n'est pas à dire qu'elle ne pousse point hors d'elle de vapeurs ny d'exhalaisons. Nos nüages que nous voïons portez en l'air ne sont que des exhalaisons &amp; des vapeurs, qui au sortir de la Terre estoient separées en trop petites parties pour pouvoir estre veuës, &amp; qui ont rencontré un peu plus haut une froideur qui les a reserrées, &amp; renduës visibles par la reünion de leurs parties, aprés quoy ce sont de gros nüages qui flotent en l'air ou ils sont des Corps étrangers, jusqu'à ce qu'ils retombét en pluyes. Mais ces mesmes vapeurs, &amp; ces mesmes exhalaisons se tiennent quelquefois assez dispersées pour estre imperceptibles, &amp; ne se ramassent qu'en formant des rosées tres subtiles, qu'on ne voit tomber d'aucune nuée. Il se peut aussi que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, (car enfin il faut qu'il en sorte, il n'est pas croyable que la Lune soit une masse dont toutes les parties soient d'une égale solidité; toutes également en repos les unes auprés des autres, toutes incapables de recevoir aucun changement par l'action du Soleil sur elles; nous ne connoissons aucun Corps de cette nature, les Marbres mesmes n'en sont pas, tout ce qui est le plus solide change &amp; s'altere, ou par le mouvement secret &amp; invisible qu'il a en luy-mesme, ou par celuy qu'il reçoit de dehors.) Il se peut donc que les vapeurs qui sortent de la Lune, ne se rassemblent point autour d'elle en nuages, &amp; ne retomberont point sur elle en pluyes, mais seulement en rosées. Il suffit pour cela que l'air dont apparemment la Lune est environnée en son particulier, comme nostre Terre l'est du sien, soit un peu different de nostre Air, &amp; les vapeurs de la Lune un peu differentes des vapeurs de la Terre, ce qui est quelque chose de plus que vraysemblable.

The Moon, which I told you yesterday was according to all appearance inhabited, may possibly not be so; I have thought of a thing that indangers the Inhabitants. I cannot suffer that, says she; Yesterday you made me Page 39 expect to see them soon here, and now there's no such people in the World. You shall not delude me so. You made me believe the Inhabitants of the Moon. I have overcome the difficulty of doing so, and I will believe it. Not so fast, said I, you ought to yield your self but by halves in things that are to be believ'd, and to reserve one half free where the contrary may be admitted, if occasion be. I'm not to be satisfied, said she, with Sentences; let's go to the matter: Are we not to argue of the Moon, as of St. Denis? No, said I, the Moon is not so like the Earth, as St. Denis is to Paris. The Sun raises from the Earth and Waters Exhalations and Vapours which mount in the Air to a certain heighth, where they gather and form the Clouds. Those Clouds hanging there, fly irregularly about our Globe, and shadow sometime one Country, sometime another. Whoever should see the Earth at a distance, would often observe great changes upon the surface; for a large Country cover'd with Clouds would appear an obscure part, and would become luminous as the Clouds remov'd. The Spots would appear to change place, or gather in diverse manners, or wholly disappear: So likewise we should see the same changes in the face of the Moon, if she had Clouds about her: but on the contrary all her Spots are fix'd, her parts always luminous, and there's the mischief on't. By this account the Sun raises no Vapours nor Exhalations about the Moon. It must therefore be a body infinitely more hard and solid than our Earth, and the more subtil parts of it easlly disingage themselves from the others, and mount on high as soon as they are put in motion by the Heat: So that it must be a mass of Rocks and Marble where there are no Evaporations: For they are so naturally &amp; necessarily rais'd where there are Waters, that there must needs be no Water where there is no Vapour. What are then the Inhabitants of those Rocks, which can produce nothing, and of that Country that has no Water? How now! cry'd she, have you forgot that you assur'd me there were Seas in the Moon to be seen from hence? That's but a conjecture, said I, I am sorry for it; those obscure parts which are taken for Seas, perhaps are but great Cavities: at this distance it may be allow'd not to guess exactly right. But, says she, is that sufficient to make us renounce the Inhabitants of the Moon? Not wholly, Madam, said I, we will neither conclude for them nor against them. I must confess my Weakness, says she, I am not capable of so perfect an irresolution; I must believe. Fix me presently in some one opinion concerning the Inhabitants of the Moon; let us preserve them or annihilate them for ever, that they may be no more spoken of; but rather let us preserve them, if possible; for I have entertain'd an inclination for them which I can hardly quit. Why then, said I, I will not leave the Moon a Desart, let us people it again to satisfie you. In truth, since the Appearance of the Spots of the Moon do not change, it cannot be believ'd that that there are Clouds about her that darken sometimes one part, sometime another; but yet that doth not argue that she doth not send out Vapours and Exhalations. Our Clouds which we see carried in the Air are but Exhalations and Vapours, which at their rising from the Earth are separated in particles too small to be seen, and which when mounted a little higher meet a Cold that condenses them, and renders them visible by the union of their parts, after which they become gross Clouds that float in the Air, where their bodys are strangers till they fall in Rain: But those very Vapours and Exhalations are sometimes dispersed enough to become invisible, and do not reunite, but when they form a subtil Dew, which is not seen to fall from any Cloud. It may be likewise that the Vapours which rise from the Moon; (for it must needs be that some do arise from her. It is not credible that the Moon should be a body of so equal a solidity in its parts, all equally in repose one after the other, and all incapable of receiving any change by the action of the Sun upon them: We do not know any such body in nature. Marble it self is not so; Whatever is most solid changes and alters, either by a secret and invisible motion in it self, or by some that it receives from without;) it may be then that those Vapours that rise from the Moon, do not gather about her in Clouds, nor fall back upon her in Rain, but only in Dew: and for that, it is sufficient that the Air, with which the Moon is apparently surrounded, as our Earth is with hers, is somewhat different from our Air, and the Vapours of the Moon somewhat different from the Vapours of the Earth, which is a thing more than probable. Upon this account it will follow, that the matter being otherwise dispos'd in the Moon than upon the Earth, the effects must be different; but it matters not.

We should be sufficiently astonished if we were in Saturn, to see over our heads in the night that great Ring, which moving in form of a Semicircle from one end of the Horizon to the other, reflects the Light of the Sun, and performs the office of a perpetual Moon. And, says the Marchioness, laughing, must we not likewise have Inhabitants in that great Ring? Truly said I, however I may be bold enough to plant them every where else, I must confess, I dare not place any there, that Ring seems a habitation too irregular. But as for the five little Moons, I think we cannot well dispense with peopling them; if in the mean time that Ring be, as some suspect, no more than a circle of Moons that follow one another very close with an equal motion, and that the five little Moons are such as have made their escape from the great Circle, what an infinity of Worlds shall we have in that Vortex of Saturn? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">however it be, the people of Saturn, with all the help of that Ring, are miserable enough</span></span>.

Were they brought into the coldest of our Countrys, as Groenland or Lapland, you would see them melt and <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">expire with heat</span></span>. You give me, says the Marchioness, an Idea of Saturn that freezes me, as just now you heated me in your discourse of Mercury. It must needs be, says I, that two Worlds that are in the extermities of this great Vortex, should be opposite in all things.</p>","explanations":["The French 'une petite Etoile blanche & pâle' (a small white and pale star) has been translated with additional explicitation as 'a small Star, pale and wan'.

Given the historical context of the Scientific Revolution and emerging new astronomical concepts, the translator could have provided additional clarification about what comets were understood to be at that time.","In the French text, Saturn is mentioned but its ring is described without further explanation. The translator has maintained this same level of explanation in English without elaborating on Saturn's ring, despite this being an opportunity to clarify this astronomical feature to English readers who might be less familiar with these concepts than the French audience Fontenelle was addressing.","The French text mentions a planet with 'quatre petites qui la suivent' (four small ones that follow it) without explicitly identifying this as Jupiter with its moons. The translator has maintained this same implicit reference without clarification, despite the Scientific Revolution context where many English readers might have benefited from more explicit information about Jupiter's moons, discovered by Galileo."]},{"sourceHtml":"<p>P104: Il ne faut donc plus songer, luy dis-je, à vous donner de la pitié pour les habitans d'une Comète, mais j'espere du moins que vous plaindrez ceux qui vivent dans un Tourbillon dont le Soleil vient à s'éteindre, &amp; qui demeurent dans une nuit éternelle. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"1\">Quoi? s'écria-t-elle, des Soleils s'éteignent?</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"0\">Oüi, sans doute</span></span>, répondis-je. Les Anciens ont vû dans le Ciel des Etoiles fixes que nous n'y voyons plus. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"2\">Ces Soleils ont perdu leur lumiere; grande desolation assurément dans tout le Tourbillon; mortalité generale sur toutes les Planetes; car que faire sans Soleil?</span></span> Cette idée est trop funeste, reprit-elle. N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me l'épargner? <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"3\">Je vous diray si vous voulez, répondis-je, ce que disent de fort habiles gens</span></span>, que les Etoiles fixes qui ont disparu ne se sont pas pour cela éteintes, que ce sont des Soleils qui ne le sont qu'à demy, c'est à dire qui ont une moitié obscure, &amp; l'autre lumineuse; que comme ils tournent sur eux-mesmes, tantost ils nous presentent la moitié lumineuse, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons, tantost la moitié obscure, &amp; qu'alors nous ne les voyons plus. Je prendray bien pour vous obliger cette opinion là, qui est plus douce que l'autre, mais je ne puis la prendre qu'à l'égard de certaines Etoiles qui ont des temps reglez pour paroître &amp; pour disparoistre, ainsi qu'on a commencé à s'en apercevoir, autrement les demy Soleils ne peuvent pas subsister. Mais que dirons-nous des Etoiles qui disparoissent &amp; ne se remontrent pas aprés le temps pendant lequel elles auroient dû assurément achever de tourner sur elles-mesmes? Vous estes trop équitable pour vouloir m'obliger à croire que ce soient des demy Soleils: cependant je feray encore un effort en vostre faveur. Ces Soleils ne se seront pas éteints, ils se seront seulement enfoncez dans la profondeur immense du Ciel, &amp; nous ne pourrons plus les voir. En ce cas le Tourbillon aura suivy son Soleil, &amp; tout s'y portera bien. Il est vray que la plus grande partie des Etoiles fixes n'ont pas ce mouvement par lequel elles s'éloignent de nous, car en d'autres temps elles devroient s'en rapprocher, &amp; nous les verrions tantost plus grandes, tantost plus petites, ce qui n'arrive pas. Mais nous supposerons qu'il n'y a que quelques petits Tourbillons plus legers &amp; plus agiles qui se glissent entre les autres, &amp; font de certains tours, au bout desquels ils reviennent, tandis que le gros des Tourbillons demeure immobile; mais voicy un étrange malheur, il y a des Etoiles fixes qui viennent se montrer à nous, qui passent beaucoup de temps à ne faire que paroistre &amp; disparoistre, &amp; enfin disparoissent entierement, des demi Soleils reparoîtroient dans des temps reglez. Des Soleils qui s'enfonceroient dans le Ciel ne disparoistroient qu'une fois pour ne reparoistre de longtemps. Prenez vostre resolution, Madame, avec courage; il faut que ces Etoiles soient des Soleils qui s'obscurcissent assez pour cesser d'estre visibles à nos yeux, &amp; en suite se rallument, &amp; à la fin s'éteignent tout à fait. Comment un Soleil peut-il s'obscurcir &amp; s'éteindre, dit la Marquise, luy qui est en luy-mesme une source de lumiere? Le plus aisément du Monde, selon Descartes, répondis-je, nostre Soleil a des tâches. Que ce soient ou des écumes, des broüillards, ou tout ce qu'il vous plaira, ces taches peuvent s'épaissir, se mettre plusieurs ensemble, s'accrocher les unes aux autres, en suite elles iront jusqu'à former autour du Soleil une croûte qui s'augmentera toujours, &amp; adieu le Soleil. Nous l'avons déja même échepée belle, dit-on. Le Soleil a esté tres-pasle pendant des années entieres, pendant celle, par exemple, qui suivit la mort de Cesar. C'estoit la croûte qui commençoit à se faire, la force du Soleil la rompit &amp; la dissipa; mais si elle eust continué, nous estions perdus. Vous me faites trembler, dit la Marquise. Presentement que je sçay les consequences de la pâleur du Soleil, je crois qu'au lieu d'aller voir les matins à mon miroir si je ne suis point pasle, j'iray voir au Ciel si le Soleil ne l'est point luy même. Ah! Madame, répondis-je, rassurez-vous, il faut du temps pour ruiner un Monde. Mais enfin, dit-elle, il ne faut que du temps? Je vous l'avouë, repris-je: Toute cette masse immense de matiere qui compose l'Univers est dans un mouvement perpétuel, dont aucune de ses parties n'est entierement exempte; &amp; dés qu'il y a du mouvement quelque part, ne vous y fiez point, il faut qu'il arrive des changemens: soit lents, soit prompts, mais toujours dans des temps proportionnez à l'effet. <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"4\">Les Anciens estoient plaisans de s'imaginer que les Corps celestes étoient de nature à ne changer jamais, parce qu'ils ne les avoyent pas encore vû changer.</span></span> <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"5\">Avoyent-ils eu le loisir de s'en assurer par l'experience?</span></span> Les Anciens étoient jeunes auprés de nous. Si les Roses qui ne durent qu'un jour faisoient des Histoires, &amp; se laissoient des Memoires les unes aux autres, les premieres auroient fait le portrait de leur Jardinier d'une certaine façon, &amp; de plus de quinze mille áges de Rose, les autres qui l'auroient encore laissé à celles qui les devoyent suivre, n'y auroient rien changé. Sur cela elles diroient, nous avons toûjours vû le mesme Jardinier, de memoire de Rose on n'a vû que luy, il a toûjours esté fait comme il est, assurément il ne meurt point comme nous, il ne change seulement pas. Le raisonnement des Roses seroit-il bon? Il auroit pourtant plus de fondement que celuy que faisoient les Anciens sur les Corps celestes; &amp; quand même il ne seroit arrivé aucun changement dans les Cieux jusqu'à aujourd'huy, quand ils paroistroient marquer qu'ils seroient faits pour durer toûjours sans aucune alteration, je ne les en croirois pas encore, j'attendrois une plus longue experience. Devons-nous établir nostre durée, qui n'est que d'un instant, pour la mesure de quelque-autre? Seroit-ce à dire que ce qui auroit duré cent mille fois plus que nous, dût toûjours durer? On n'est pas si aisément éternel. Il faudroit qu'une chose eût passé bien des âges d'homme mis à bout pour commencer à donner quelque signe d'immortalité. Vrayment, dit la Marquise, je voy les Mondes bien éloignez d'y pouvoir pretendre. Je ne leur ferois seulement pas l'honneur de les comparer à ce Jardinier qui dure tant à l'égard des Roses; ils ne sont que comme les Roses mêmes qui naissent &amp; qui meurent dans un Jardin les unes aprés les autres; car je m'attens bien que s'il disparoist des Etoiles anciennes, il en paroist de nouvelles, il faut que l'espece se repare. Il n'est pas à craindre qu'elle perisse, répondis-je. Les uns vous diront que ce ne sont que des Soleils qui se rapprochent de nous aprés avoir esté long- temps perdus pour nous dans la profondeur du Ciel. D'autres vous diront que ce sont des Soleils qui se sont démeslez de cette croûte obscure qui commençoit à les environner. Je croy aisément que tout cela peut estre, mais <span class=\"highlight-text-container\"><span class=\"semi-highlight-text RW\" data-index=\"6\">je croy aussi que l'Univers peut avoir esté fait de sorte qu'il s'y formera de temps en temps des Soleils nouveaux.</span></span> Pourquoy la matiere propre à faire un Soleil ne pourra-t'elle pas, aprés avoir esté dispersée en plusieurs endroits différens, se ramasser à la longue en un certain lieu, &amp; y jetter les fondemens d'un nouveau Monde?

How! cry'd she, Suns extinct? Yes, doubtless, said I, the Ancients saw fixed Stars in the Heavens which we do not see now, those Suns have lost their Light. A great desolation most certainly in the whole Vortex, a general mortality among all the Planets for what's to be done without a Sun? That Idea, said he, is too sad, can you no way excuse me that? I'le tell you, if you please, says I, what knowing men say; That those fixed Stars which have disappear'd, are not therefore extinct, but that they are Demy Suns, that is to say, which have the one half obscure and the other luminous; and as they turn upon their own Axis they sometimes present us the luminous side, and then we see them, sometimes the obscure side, and then we see them not. I would, to oblige you, hold this Opinion, which is more moderate than the other; but I can hold it only in respect of certain Stars which have regulated times of appearing and disappearing, as is begun to be discover'd in some, otherwise the Demy Suns could not subsist. But what shall we say of those Stars that have disappear'd, and were never seen since; though in all this time they might most certainly have perform'd their Course upon their Axis. You are too just to oblige me to believe that they are Demy Suns, but yet I'le make another Essay in your favour. Those Suns shall not be extinct, they shall be only sunk into the immense profundity of Heaven, beyond the reach of our eye. In such case, the Vortex follow'd its Sun, and all's well. 'Tis true that the greatest part of the fixed Stars have not that motion, by which they remove themselves from us; for then at other times they ought to return to us, and we should see them sometimes bigger, sometimes less, which doth not happen. But we'l suppose that there are only some little Vortices lighter, and more agil, that slip in among the other, and having taken certain turns at the end of their Course they return, while the great Vortices remain immovable. But here's the mischief, there are fixed Stars, which come and shew themselves to us, and continue long in only appearing and disappearing, and at last wholly disappear. Demy Suns would appear again at regular times. Suns that sunk into the depth of Heaven would disappear but once for a long time. Now resolve, Madam, couragiously, those Stars must be Suns that obscure themselves enough not to be visible to our eyes, and they afterward take light again, and at last are wholly extinct. How can a Sun, says the Marchioness, obscure and extinguish it self, a Sun that is in it self a Source and Spring of Light? The most easily in the world, says I, according to Des Cartes. Our Sun has Spots, which are Froth, or Scum, or Mists, or what ever you please, those Spots may condense, many of them gather together and close one with another; at last they may go so far as to form a kind of a Crust about the Sun, and then farewel Sun. We have already fairly escap'd it, they say. The Sun has been very pale for some whole years together, as for example, the year after the death of Cesar; it was the Crust that began then to grow upon the Sun, but by the force of the Sun it was dissipated, had it continued we had been undone.</p> <p>P107: You make me tremble, said the Marchioness, I know now the Consequences of the paleness of the Sun, I believe in stead of going to see in my Glass in a morning if I am pale, I shall look toward Heaven, to see if the Sun be so.</p> <p>P108: Ah! Madam, said I, take courage, 'twill require time to ruine a World. But still, says she, time will do it. I confess it, said I, all this immense heap of matter, which makes up the Universe, is in perpetual motion, and no part of it wholly exempt; since then there is a motion in every part, trust it not, there must be a change, be it slow or be it swift, but still in time proportionable to the effect. The Ancients had a pleasant fancy that the celestial bodies were unchangeable, because they never saw a change in them; but had they time enough to confirm their Opinion by experience? the Ancients were young in respect of us. Should the Roses, which live but a day, write their own Story, and leave their Memoirs from one to another, the first would make a Description of their Gardiner after one certain fashion, and for more than fifteen thousand Ages of Roses, those that should leave their Story to Posterity would make no alteration; from whence they would reason thus, We have ever seen the same Gardin•r; our History tells us of no other, he was ever made as he is; certainly he dyes not as we do, nor ever changes. Would this be good Reasoning of the Roses? and yet they would have better ground for it, than the Ancients had for their Opinion of the Celestial bodies. And were it so that the Heavens had suffer'd no change to this day, had they in themselves any Sign or Character of an eternal duration without change, yet I should not believe it, but wait for farther satisfaction from a longer experience. Ought we to establish our Duration, which is but of a moment, by the measures of another? Can we argue that what has continued a hundred thousand times longer than we, will endure for ever? Eternity is not so easily acquir'd. A thing must have out-liv'd many Ages of Man, to begin only to give a sign of its Immortality.</p> <p>P109: Truly, said the Marchioness, I find the World's very far from any reason of pretending to it; I would not do them the honour so much as to compare them to the Gardiner that survives so many Roses, they are but even as the Roses themselves that spring up and perish in the same Garden one after another; for I observe that if some ancient Stars have disappear'd, new ones have succeeded, and still there must be a reparation of the Species.</p> <p>P110: There is no fear of their perishing, said I; some will tell you they are only Suns that return after a long time being lost to us in the profundity of Heaven, others will say, they are Suns that have disingag'd themselves from that obscure Crust that began to inclose them. This I easily believe may be, but I believe likewise that the Universe is so made that new Suns may be form'd in it from time to time, why may not the matter proper to make a Sun, after having been long dispers'd in several places, at last congregate it self in one certain place, and lay the foundations of a new World? I am the rather inclin'd to believe these new productions, because they agree better with those great Ideas I have of the works of Nature.

I am persuaded, and you are so likewise, that the practises the same secret in the Worlds, and it costs her no more to do it.</p> <p>P111: In good Faith, says the Marchioness, I find the Worlds, the Heavens and Celestial bodies so subject to change, that I have e'en left them.</p> <p>P112: Let us leave them more yet, said I, if you'l be persuaded by me, and talk no more of them; for you are now come to the highest Roof of Heaven, and to tell you whether there be Stars beyond that or not, will require more knowledge than I have.
