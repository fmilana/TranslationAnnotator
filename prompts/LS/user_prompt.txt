Language Simplification (LS) occurs when a translator modifies the original text to enhance readability by:
  - Simplifying complex sentence structures
  - Using more common vocabulary
  - Reducing the length or density of the text
  - This may improve accessibility but can also reduce stylistic complexity, cultural nuance, or richness.

Task: Identify and tag all instances of LS in the provided English translation by wrapping them in <LS> tags.

Instructions:
  - Identify and tag all instances of LS in the provided English translation by wrapping them in <LS> tags.
  - Provide a brief explanation for each tagged instance of LS, explaining why you think the tagging is justified. The explanation should detail what was changed in the translation to improve readability, such as sentence simplification, vocabulary simplification, or text shortening.
  - The tag does not have to be included in the text, only when necessary.
  - If no text is tagged, leave the explanation blank.
  - Output your response in JSON format.

Example 1:

Input (JSON):
{
  "source_fr": "Le Soleil est au centre de l'Univers, & là il est immobile; aprés luy qu'est-ce qui suit? C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure & Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, & vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, & ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, & si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.", 
  "target_en_untagged": "You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of 7 12 the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth."

  "explanation": "The sentence structures have been simplified to improve readability. For example, long and complex sentence constructions like 'La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, & ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours...' have been simplified to clearer, more direct phrasing in English, such as 'The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it.' This change reduces the original sentence complexity."

Input (JSON):
{
  "source_fr": "Je ne me contente, reprit-elle, ny de vos Rochers, ni de vos Oiseaux. Cela ne laisseroit pas d'être joly, mais puis que la Nature a donné tant de Lunes à Saturne & à Jupiter, c'est une marque qu'il faut des Lunes. J'eusse êté bien-aise que tous les Mondes éloignez du Soleil en eussent eu, si Mars ne nous fût point venu faire une exception desagreable. Ah! vraiment, répliquay-je, si vous vous mêliez de Philosophie plus que vous ne faites il faudroit bien que vous vous accoûtumassiez à voir des exceptions dans les meilleurs Sistêmes"
  "target_en_untagged": "Your Rocks, and your flying Birds, said the Marquiese, do not at all satisfie me. I confess such objects wou'd be very pretty; but since Nature has given so many Moons to Saturn and Iupiter; 'tis a sign, that they are absolutely necessary as well to Mars. I shou'd have been glad that all the Worlds distant from the Sun, cou'd have had their Moons; and that Mars might not have been so disagreeably excepted. Oh! Madam, said I, if you think it worth your pains to make any further Progress in Philosophy, you must accustom your self to such Exceptions."

  "explanation": "The sentence structure was simplified by breaking up longer phrases and removing more complex constructions like 'si vous vous mêliez de Philosophie plus que vous ne faites' to 'if you think it worth your pains to make any further Progress in Philosophy.' This makes the sentence more straightforward and easier to follow while retaining the essential meaning."
