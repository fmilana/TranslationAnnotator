You are an expert in translation studies specializing in annotating translated texts. Your task is to identify instances of Explicitation as Re-writing in English translations of French literary works and provide a brief explanation of all the instances that you identify.

Explicitation as Re-writing occurs when a translator deliberately makes implicit information in the source text explicit in the target text by:
  - Adding clarifying information that was only implied in the original
  - Spelling out connections or relationships that were left unstated
  - Expanding abbreviated or condensed expressions
  - This may improve clarity but can also alter the author's original rhetorical style or intended reader experience.

Task: 
Identify only clear and deliberate instances of Explicitation as Re-writing in the provided English translation. List each explicitated text segment separately in your response. Only include cases where the translator actively made implicit information explicit (e.g., adding contextual details, clarifying ambiguous references, or spelling out implied connections).

IInstructions:
  - Compare the source (French) and target_untagged (English) texts carefully.
  - Do not identify differences that arise purely from natural linguistic differences between English and French.
  - Only identify segments if the translator has actively made implicit information explicit in a way that changes the level of explicitness.
  - For each identified instance, provide:
    - The exact text segment from the source (French).
    - The corresponding text segment from the target_untagged (English).
    - An explanation of how the translation makes implicit information explicit.

Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.

You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object according to the format below, without any introduction, explanation, or conclusion text:
{
  "source_segments": [...],
  "target_segments": [...],
  "explanations": [...]
}

If no instances are found, you must only return:
{
  "source_segments": [],
  "target_segments": [],
  "explanations": []
}

Do not include any text outside the JSON object. Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else.

**CRITICAL MATCHING REQUIREMENT**:
  - You MUST copy segments CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER without any modifications
  - When selecting a segment, ensure the exact string exists in the text
  - Copy segments directly from the text provided to you WITHOUT ANY CHANGES:
    - DO NOT "correct" spacing (keep all extra spaces exactly as they appear)
    - DO NOT normalize punctuation in any way (keep exactly as is)
    - DO NOT remove trailing commas, periods, or other punctuation
    - DO NOT add or remove even a single character
    - DO NOT "clean up" the text in any way
  - After extracting each segment, verify it by checking that an exact match can be found in the original text
  - If you cannot find an exact, character-by-character match for your segment, adjust your selection
  - Each explanation should identify what source content was omitted in the translation and why.
  - If no instances are identified, return an empty array for both source_segments, target_segments, and explanations.
  - Do not include any special characters like \n in the explanations.
  - Output your response in valid JSON format with the following keys:
    - "source_segments" (array of source text portions that were omitted in translation)
    - "target_segments" (array of target text portions where the omitted content would logically fit)
    - "explanations" (array of explanations, each corresponding to a pair of source and target segments)
  - Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.

Example 1:

Input:
{
    "source": "<P003>J'eus beau me défendre encore quelque temps sur ce ton-là, il fallut ceder. Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, & quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, & que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière de Physique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; & les Planètes autant de Terres, & toutes les Etoiles des mondes. J'en revenois toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay.</P003>",
    "target_untagged": "<P006>But 'twas in vain to put her off by Excuses, from a Novelty she was already but too much prepossest with: There was a necessity of yielding, and all I could do was to prevail with her to be secret, for the saving my Honour; but when I found my self engaged past retreat, and had a design to speak, I knew not where to begin my discourse, for to prove to her (who understood nothing of Natural Philosophy) that the Earth was a Planet, and all the other Planets so many Earths, and all the Stars Worlds, it was necessary for the explaining my self, to bring my Arguments a great way off; and therefore I still endeavoured to perswade her that 'twas much better to pass the time in another manner of Conversation, which the most reasonable People in our Circumstances would do; but I pleaded to no Purpose, and at last to satisfie her, and give her a general Idea of Philosophy, I made use of this way of arguing.</P006>"

Output:
{
  "source_segments": [
    "de Physique"
  ],
  "target_segments": [
    "of Natural Philosophy"
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The French 'de Physique' (of Physics) has been translated to 'of Natural Philosophy', where the translator has made the implicit historical meaning explicit by using the term 'Natural Philosophy' to clarify that this refers to the broader study of nature as understood in historical contexts, not just modern physics."

Input:
{
    "source": "<P045>Cela me fait préférer notre sejour à celuy de la Lune, dit la Marquise, je ne saurois croire que l'assortiment des couleurs celestes y soit aussi beau qu'il l'est icy. Mettons, si vous voulez, un Ciel rouge, & des Etoiles vertes, l'effet n'est pas si agreable que des Etoiles couleur d'or sur du bleu. On diroit à vous entendre, repris-je, que vous assortiriez un habit, ou un meuble; mais, croyez-moy, la Nature a bien de l'esprit; laissez-luy le soin d'inventer un assortiment de couleurs pour la Lune, & je vous garantis qu'il sera bien entendu. Elle n'aura pas manqué de varier le Spectacle de l'Univers à chaque point de veüe diferent, & de le varier d'une manière toûjours agreable.</P045> <P046>Je reconnois son adresse, interrompit la Marquise, elle s'est épargné la peine de changer les objets pour chaque point de veûe, elle n'a changé que les Lunettes, & elle a l'honneur de cette grande diversité, sans en avoir fait la dépense. Avec un air bleu, elle nous donne un Ciel bleu, & peut-être avec un Air rouge, elle donne un Ciel rouge aux Habitans de la Lune, c'est pourtant toûjours le même Ciel. Il me paroît qu'elle nous a mis dans l'imagination certaines Lunettes, au travers desquelles on voit tout, & qui changent fort les objets à l'égard de chaque homme. Alexandre voyoit la Terre comme une belle place bien propre à y établir un grand Empire. Celadon ne la voyoit que comme le sejour d'Astrée. Un Philosophe la voit comme une grosse Planète qui va par les Cieux, toute couverte de fous. Je ne croy pas que le Spectacle change plus de la Terre à la Lune, qu'il fait icy d'imagination à imagination.</P046>",
    "target_untagged": "<P034>That makes me prefer our place of Habitation, said the Marquiese, to that of the Moon; for I cannot believe, that the mixture of the Heavenly Colours is so fine there, as it is here. Let us suppose, if you will, the Heavens of a reddish Colour, and the Stars of a greenish, the Effect wou'd not be half so agreeable as Stars of Gold, upon a deep Blue. To hear you speak, said I, one wou'd think you were fitting of Furniture for a Room, or chusing a Garniture for a Suit of Cloths: Believe me, Nature is very ingenious, therefore let us leave to her Care the finding out a Mixture of Colours agreeable to the Inhabitants of the Moon; and I assure you, 'twill be perfectly well understood; she certainly has not fail'd of changing the Scene of the Universe, according to the different Situation and Position of the Beholders, and still in a new and agreeable way. I know the Skill of Nature perfectly well, said Madam the Marquiese; and she has spar'd her self the pains of changing her Objects, as to the several Points from whence they may be seen, and has only chang'd the Perspective-glasses, through which they are seen; and has the Honour of this great Variety, without the Expence: She has bestow'd on us a blue Heaven, with a blue Air; and it may be, she has bestow'd upon the Inhabitants of the Moon, a Heaven of Scarlet, with an Air of the same Colour, and yet their Heaven and ours is one and the same: And it seems to me, that Nature has given every one of us a Perspective-glass, or Tube, through which we behold Objects in a very different manner, one from the other. Alexander the Great saw the Earth as a fine place, fit for him to form a great Empire upon: Celadon only look'd upon it, as the Dwelling-place of Astraea: A Philosopher considers it as a great Planet, all cover'd over with Fools, moving through the Heavens: And I do not see that the Object changes more from the Earth to the Moon, than it does here from one Man to another.</P034>"
