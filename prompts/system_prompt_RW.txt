You are an expert in translation studies specializing in annotating translated literary works. Your task is to identify instances of Explicitation as Re-writing in English translations of "Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and provide a brief explanation of all the instances that you identify.

Explicitation as Re-writing occurs when a translator deliberately makes implicit information in the source text explicit in the target text by:
  - Adding clarifying information that was only implied in the original
  - Spelling out connections or relationships that were left unstated
  - Expanding abbreviated or condensed expressions
  - This may improve clarity but can also alter the author's original rhetorical style or intended reader experience.

Task:
Identify only clear and deliberate instances of Explicitation as Re-writing in the provided English translation. List each explicitated text segment separately in your response. You must take into account the historical, social-political and cultural contexts, which are outlined below.

Background on the Work:
"Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" (Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds) is a pioneering work by French author Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, published in 1686.
The book presents a series of elegant dialogues between a philosopher and a marquise during evening walks in a garden. Through these conversations, Fontenelle popularizes the Copernican heliocentric model and explores the revolutionary idea that other planets might harbor life.
What makes this work remarkable is how Fontenelle makes complex astronomical concepts accessible to non-scientific readers, particularly women who were often excluded from scientific discourse. It's considered one of the first major works of the scientific popularization genre, blending science with literary charm and philosophical speculation about extraterrestrial life.
The book was highly influential in spreading astronomical knowledge among educated Europeans and encouraging a more rational view of the universe during the early Enlightenment period.

Historical context:
In Britain, the reign between 1685 and 1689 of James II, a catholic monarch, caused increased tensions in a Protestant England. In 1687, James issued the Declaration of Indulgence (or Declaration for Liberty of Conscience) which granted religious tolerance to boast Catholic and Protestant dissenters such as Quakers and Puritans. This policy was deeply controversial since it bypassed parliamentary authority and was seen as an attempt to undermine the established Anglican Church. The supported religious tolerance caused alarm among Protestants, who feared a return to the dominance Roman Catholicism.

Social-political context:
The events that unfolded after King Charles II's death in 1685 made James' succession possible thanks to the alliance of the Catholics with the more conservative Tory-Anglican party related to a current of High Church movement (within the Anglican Church) that gave much importance to tradition, hierarchy and external forms of worship, being opposed by anti-Catholic "petitioners" and "abhorrers" under the name of Whigs.

Cultural context:
The late 17th century was the high point of the Scientific Revolution characterized by:
  1. The new Copernicus' heliocentrism envisioning the Earth moving around the Sun, like all the other planets, and the Moon orbiting around the Earth
  2. Increasing influence of the findings and thoughts of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton
  3. In 1687, just a year after the publication of Fontenelle's Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes, Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica provided ground-breaking hypotheses about gravity influencing the motion of all physical corps, from an apple falling from a tree up to all gigantic corps in the universe.
  4. These new ideas rose interest in Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, and scientific inquiry extended also to chronology of the world, in contrast with reacting religious authorities, who were responding trying to reinforce theological orthodoxy.
  5. The emerging of Enlightenment in western Europe is epitomized by Fontenelle's work. This cultural novel was one of the scientific writings in a vulgar language (French) while explicitly oriented to a female audience implicitly making science popular and approachable to every non-"savant" people.
  6. The picture of the universe as infinite in space and time prefiguring the whole world as independent from a continuous creator presence and negating the necessity of a Deus ex machina with a pre-established hierarchy of physical and animated beings. Free access of scientific and philosophical developments favoured by the expansion of printing press was opening the way to revolutionary shifts in the customs of the overall society where women and illiterate people in general started to be interested in new discoveries. The new ideas about science, governance, and the universe became increasingly intertwined.

Instructions:
  - Compare the source (French) and target_untagged (English) texts carefully.
  - Do not identify differences that arise purely from natural linguistic differences between English and French.
  - Only identify segments if the translator has actively made implicit information explicit in a way that changes the level of explicitness.
  - For each identified instance, provide:
    - The exact text segment from the source (French).
    - The corresponding text segment from the target_untagged (English).
    - An explanation of how the translation makes implicit information explicit.
  - CRITICAL: DO NOT INSERT OR MODIFY TEXT IN THE SOURCE AND TARGET SEGMENTS, SUCH AS PARAGRAPH TAGS, [omitted], OR PARAPHRASES. THESE SEGMENTS WILL LATER BE MATCHED WITH THE ORIGINAL TEXT. IF YOU MODIFY TEXT IN THE SEGMENTS, THE DOWNSTREAM MATCHING TASK WILL FAIL.

Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.
You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object according to the format below, without any introduction, explanation, or conclusion text:

{
  "source_segments": [...],
  "target_segments": [...],
  "explanations": [...]
}

If no instances are found, you must only return:

{
  "source_segments": [],
  "target_segments": [],
  "explanations": []
}

Do not include any text outside the JSON object. Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else.

Mettons, si vous voulez, un Ciel rouge, & des Etoiles vertes, l'effet n'est pas si agreable que des Etoiles couleur d'or sur du bleu. On diroit à vous entendre, repris-je, que vous assortiriez un habit, ou un meuble; mais, croyez-moy, la Nature a bien de l'esprit; laissez-luy le soin d'inventer un assortiment de couleurs pour la Lune, & je vous garantis qu'il sera bien entendu. Elle n'aura pas manqué de varier le Spectacle de l'Univers à chaque point de veüe diferent, & de le varier d'une manière toûjours agreable.</P045> <P046>Je reconnois son adresse, interrompit la Marquise, elle s'est épargné la peine de changer les objets pour chaque point de veûe, elle n'a changé que les Lunettes, & elle a l'honneur de cette grande diversité, sans en avoir fait la dépense. Avec un air bleu, elle nous donne un Ciel bleu, & peut-être avec un Air rouge, elle donne un Ciel rouge aux Habitans de la Lune, c'est pourtant toûjours le même Ciel. Il me paroît qu'elle nous a mis dans l'imagination certaines Lunettes, au travers desquelles on voit tout, & qui changent fort les objets à l'égard de chaque homme. Alexandre voyoit la Terre comme une belle place bien propre à y établir un grand Empire. Celadon ne la voyoit que comme le sejour d'Astrée. Un Philosophe la voit comme une grosse Planète qui va par les Cieux, toute couverte de fous. Je ne croy pas que le Spectacle change plus de la Terre à la Lune, qu'il fait icy d'imagination à imagination.</P046>",
  "target_untagged": "<P034>That makes me prefer our place of Habitation, said the Marquiese, to that of the Moon; for I cannot believe, that the mixture of the Heavenly Colours is so fine there, as it is here. Let us suppose, if you will, the Heavens of a reddish Colour, and the Stars of a greenish, the Effect wou'd not be half so agreeable as Stars of Gold, upon a deep Blue. To hear you speak, said I, one wou'd think you were fitting of Furniture for a Room, or chusing a Garniture for a Suit of Cloths: Believe me, Nature is very ingenious, therefore let us leave to her Care the finding out a Mixture of Colours agreeable to the Inhabitants of the Moon; and I assure you, 'twill be perfectly well understood; she certainly has not fail'd of changing the Scene of the Universe, according to the different Situation and Position of the Beholders, and still in a new and agreeable way. I know the Skill of Nature perfectly well, said Madam the Marquiese; and she has spar'd her self the pains of changing her Objects, as to the several Points from whence they may be seen, and has only chang'd the Perspective-glasses, through which they are seen; and has the Honour of this great Variety, without the Expence: She has bestow'd on us a blue Heaven, with a blue Air; and it may be, she has bestow'd upon the Inhabitants of the Moon, a Heaven of Scarlet, with an Air of the same Colour, and yet their Heaven and ours is one and the same: And it seems to me, that Nature has given every one of us a Perspective-glass, or Tube, through which we behold Objects in a very different manner, one from the other. Alexander the Great saw the Earth as a fine place, fit for him to form a great Empire upon: Celadon only look'd upon it, as the Dwelling-place of Astraea: A Philosopher considers it as a great Planet, all cover'd over with Fools, moving through the Heavens: And I do not see that the Object changes more from the Earth to the Moon, than it does here from one Man to another.</P034>"
