You are an expert in translation studies specializing in annotating translated texts. Your task is to identify instances of Self-Censorship in English translations of French literary works and provide a brief explanation of all the instances that you identify.

Self-Censorship occurs when the translator omits ideological elements from the source text in the translation. These are elements that:
  - Appear in the source text but are deliberately omitted in the target text
  - Represent cultural, religious, political, or other ideologically sensitive content filtered out during translation
  - May include references, terminology, or concepts that are intentionally excluded from the target text
  - Result in the target text being ideologically sanitized compared to the source text

Task: 
Identify only clear instances of Self-Censorship in the provided translation. Instead of inserting tags directly, list each omitted text segment separately in your response. Only include cases where the translator has deliberately omitted source text elements in the target text. 

Instructions:
  - Compare the source text and target_untagged text carefully.
  - Do not identify differences that arise purely from natural linguistic differences between the source and target languages.
  - Only identify segments if the translator has deliberately omitted content from the source text that should appear in the target text.
  - For each identified instance, provide:
    - The exact text segment from the source text that was omitted in the translation.
    - The corresponding complete text segment from the target_untagged text where this omitted content would logically fit (but doesn't appear).
    - An explanation of why this source text element was likely censored in the translation.

Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.

You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object according to the format below, without any introduction, explanation, or conclusion text:
{
  "source_segments": [...],
  "target_segments": [...],
  "explanations": [...]
}

If no instances are found, you must only return:
{
  "source_segments": [],
  "target_segments": [],
  "explanations": []
}

Do not include any text outside the JSON object. Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else.

**CRITICAL MATCHING REQUIREMENT**:
  - You MUST copy segments CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER without any modifications
  - When selecting a segment, ensure the exact string exists in the text
  - Copy segments directly from the text provided to you WITHOUT ANY CHANGES:
    - DO NOT "correct" spacing (keep all extra spaces exactly as they appear)
    - DO NOT normalize punctuation in any way (keep exactly as is)
    - DO NOT remove trailing commas, periods, or other punctuation
    - DO NOT add or remove even a single character
    - DO NOT "clean up" the text in any way
  - After extracting each segment, verify it by checking that an exact match can be found in the original text
  - If you cannot find an exact, character-by-character match for your segment, adjust your selection
  - Each explanation should identify what source content was omitted in the translation and why.
  - If no instances are identified, return an empty array for both source_segments, target_segments, and explanations.
  - Do not include any special characters like \n in the explanations.
  - Output your response in valid JSON format with the following keys:
    - "source_segments" (array of source text portions that were omitted in translation)
    - "target_segments" (array of target text portions where the omitted content would logically fit)
    - "explanations" (array of explanations, each corresponding to a pair of source and target segments)
  - Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input:
{
  "source": "<P067>Je conçois, dit la <IIM>Marquise</IIM>, que ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs. Plût à Dieu qu'il y eût quelque chose de pareil qui les reglât parmi nous, & qui fixât les Gens dans les places qui leur sont naturellement convenables. Me voilà fort en repos du côté de Jupiter. Je suis bien aise qu'il nous laisse dans notre petit tourbillon avec notre Lune unique. Je suis bien-aise qu'il nous laisse dans notre petit Tourbillon avec notre Lune unique. Je suis d'humeur à me borner aisément, & je ne lui envie point les quatre qu'il a.</P067>",
  "target_untagged": "<P050>I understand very well, said the Marquiese, how these different Weights are regulated, according to their several degrees: Wou'd to God, there were some such Order amongst us Mortals, to confine every Man to the Station that is fit for him. I am now no longer in fear of Iupiter; I am satisfy'd that he will leave us at ease in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion; I am easily pleas'd, and do not envy Iupiter his four Moons.</P050>"
}

Output:
{
  "source_segments": [
    "avec notre Lune unique"
  ],
  "target_segments": [
    "in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion"
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The translator omitted the phrase 'avec notre Lune unique' (with our unique Moon) which should have appeared after 'in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion'. This censorship removes the reference to Earth having only one moon, possibly to simplify the text or because the translator felt it was redundant given the mention of Jupiter's four moons later in the passage."
  ]
}

Example 2:

Input:
{
  "source": "<P074>Si ce n'êtoit, dit la <IIM>Marquise</IIM>, qu'il n'est point trop agreable de savoir qu'on ne nous peut découvrir de dedans Jupiter qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche, je me représenterois avec plaisir ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, comme les nôtres le sont vers luy, & cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considèrent & demandent l'une de l'autre, Quel monde est-ce là? Quelles gens l'habitent?</P074>",
  "target_untagged": "<P054>If it were not, said the Marquiese, very disagreeable for me to believe, that our Earth is not to be perceiv'd by the Inhabitants of Iupiter, but by the help of a Telescope, I shou'd find an Infinite Pleasure in imagining, I shou'd see those Telescopes <SC></SC> pointing towards us; and ours from a mutual Curiosity are levell'd at them, whil'st those two Planets gravely considering one another, the Inhabitants of both ask at one and the same time, What World is that? What People are those?</P054>"
}

Output:
{
  "source_segments": [
    "de Jupiter"
  ],
  "target_segments": [
    "those Telescopes "
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The translator omitted the phrase 'de Jupiter' (of Jupiter) which should have appeared after 'those Telescopes'. This censorship removes the specific attribution of the telescopes to Jupiter, making the text more ambiguous about which planet's telescopes are being discussed, possibly to simplify the translation or to avoid repetition since Jupiter is mentioned earlier in the paragraph."
