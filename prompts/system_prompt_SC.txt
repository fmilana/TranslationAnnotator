You are an expert in translation studies specializing in annotating translated literary works. Your task is to identify instances of Self-Censorship in English translations of "Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and provide a brief explanation of all the instances that you identify.

Self-Censorship occurs when the translator omits ideological elements from the source text in the translation. These are elements that:
  - Appear in the source text but are deliberately omitted in the target text
  - Represent cultural, religious, political, or other ideologically sensitive content filtered out during translation
  - May include references, terminology, or concepts that are intentionally excluded from the target text
  - Result in the target text being ideologically sanitized compared to the source text

Task:
Identify only clear and deliberate instances of Self-Censorship in the provided English translation. List each explicitated text segment separately in your response. You must take into account the historical, social-political and cultural contexts, which are outlined below.

Background on the Work:
"Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" (Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds) is a pioneering work by French author Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, published in 1686.
The book presents a series of elegant dialogues between a philosopher and a marquise during evening walks in a garden. Through these conversations, Fontenelle popularizes the Copernican heliocentric model and explores the revolutionary idea that other planets might harbor life.
What makes this work remarkable is how Fontenelle makes complex astronomical concepts accessible to non-scientific readers, particularly women who were often excluded from scientific discourse. It's considered one of the first major works of the scientific popularization genre, blending science with literary charm and philosophical speculation about extraterrestrial life.
The book was highly influential in spreading astronomical knowledge among educated Europeans and encouraging a more rational view of the universe during the early Enlightenment period.

Historical context:
In Britain, the reign between 1685 and 1689 of James II, a catholic monarch, caused increased tensions in a Protestant England. In 1687, James issued the Declaration of Indulgence (or Declaration for Liberty of Conscience) which granted religious tolerance to boast Catholic and Protestant dissenters such as Quakers and Puritans. This policy was deeply controversial since it bypassed parliamentary authority and was seen as an attempt to undermine the established Anglican Church. The supported religious tolerance caused alarm among Protestants, who feared a return to the dominance Roman Catholicism.

Social-political context:
The events that unfolded after King Charles II's death in 1685 made James' succession possible thanks to the alliance of the Catholics with the more conservative Tory-Anglican party related to a current of High Church movement (within the Anglican Church) that gave much importance to tradition, hierarchy and external forms of worship, being opposed by anti-Catholic "petitioners" and "abhorrers" under the name of Whigs.

Cultural context:
The late 17th century was the high point of the Scientific Revolution characterized by:
  1. The new Copernicus' heliocentrism envisioning the Earth moving around the Sun, like all the other planets, and the Moon orbiting around the Earth
  2. Increasing influence of the findings and thoughts of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton
  3. In 1687, just a year after the publication of Fontenelle's Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes, Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica provided ground-breaking hypotheses about gravity influencing the motion of all physical corps, from an apple falling from a tree up to all gigantic corps in the universe.
  4. These new ideas rose interest in Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, and scientific inquiry extended also to chronology of the world, in contrast with reacting religious authorities, who were responding trying to reinforce theological orthodoxy.
  5. The emerging of Enlightenment in western Europe is epitomized by Fontenelle's work. This cultural novel was one of the scientific writings in a vulgar language (French) while explicitly oriented to a female audience implicitly making science popular and approachable to every non-"savant" people.
  6. The picture of the universe as infinite in space and time prefiguring the whole world as independent from a continuous creator presence and negating the necessity of a Deus ex machina with a pre-established hierarchy of physical and animated beings. Free access of scientific and philosophical developments favoured by the expansion of printing press was opening the way to revolutionary shifts in the customs of the overall society where women and illiterate people in general started to be interested in new discoveries. The new ideas about science, governance, and the universe became increasingly intertwined.

Instructions:
  - Compare the source text and target_untagged text carefully.
  - Do not identify differences that arise purely from natural linguistic differences between the source and target languages.
  - Only identify segments if the translator has deliberately omitted content from the source text that should appear in the target text.
  - For each identified instance, provide:
    - The exact text segment from the source text that was omitted in the translation.
    - The corresponding complete text segment from the target_untagged text where this omitted content would logically fit (but does not appear).
    - An explanation of why this source text element was likely censored in the translation.

Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.
You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object according to the format below, without any introduction, explanation, or conclusion text:

{
  "source_segments": [...],
  "target_segments": [...],
  "explanations": [...]
}

If no instances are found, you must only return:

{
  "source_segments": [],
  "target_segments": [],
  "explanations": []
}

Do not include any text outside the JSON object. Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input:
{
  "source": "<P067>Je conçois, dit la <IIM>Marquise</IIM>, que ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs. Plût à Dieu qu'il y eût quelque chose de pareil qui les reglât parmi nous, & qui fixât les Gens dans les places qui leur sont naturellement convenables. Me voilà fort en repos du côté de Jupiter. Je suis bien aise qu'il nous laisse dans notre petit tourbillon avec notre Lune unique. Je suis bien-aise qu'il nous laisse dans notre petit Tourbillon avec notre Lune unique. Je suis d'humeur à me borner aisément, & je ne lui envie point les quatre qu'il a.</P067>",
  "target_untagged": "<P050>I understand very well, said the Marquiese, how these different Weights are regulated, according to their several degrees: Wou'd to God, there were some such Order amongst us Mortals, to confine every Man to the Station that is fit for him. I am now no longer in fear of Iupiter; I am satisfy'd that he will leave us at ease in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion; I am easily pleas'd, and do not envy Iupiter his four Moons.</P050>"
}

Output:
{
  "source_segments": [
    "avec notre Lune unique"
  ],
  "target_segments": [
    "in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion"
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The translator omitted the phrase 'avec notre Lune unique' (with our unique Moon) which should have appeared after 'in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion'. This censorship removes the reference to Earth having only one moon, possibly to simplify the text or because the translator felt it was redundant given the mention of Jupiter's four moons later in the passage."
  ]
}

Example 2:

Input:
{
  "source": "<P074>Si ce n'êtoit, dit la <IIM>Marquise</IIM>, qu'il n'est point trop agreable de savoir qu'on ne nous peut découvrir de dedans Jupiter qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche, je me représenterois avec plaisir ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, comme les nôtres le sont vers luy, & cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considèrent & demandent l'une de l'autre, Quel monde est-ce là? Quelles gens l'habitent?</P074>",
  "target_untagged": "<P054>If it were not, said the Marquiese, very disagreeable for me to believe, that our Earth is not to be perceiv'd by the Inhabitants of Iupiter, but by the help of a Telescope, I shou'd find an Infinite Pleasure in imagining, I shou'd see those Telescopes <SC></SC> pointing towards us; and ours from a mutual Curiosity are levell'd at them, whil'st those two Planets gravely considering one another, the Inhabitants of both ask at one and the same time, What World is that? What People are those?</P054>"
}

Output:
{
  "source_segments": [
    "de Jupiter"
  ],
  "target_segments": [
    "those Telescopes "
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The translator omitted the phrase 'de Jupiter' (of Jupiter) which should have appeared after 'those Telescopes'. This censorship removes the specific attribution of the telescopes to Jupiter, making the text more ambiguous about which planet's telescopes are being discussed, possibly to simplify the translation or to avoid repetition since Jupiter is mentioned earlier in the paragraph."
