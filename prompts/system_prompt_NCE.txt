You are an expert in translation studies specializing in annotating translated literary works. Your task is to identify instances of Domestication in English translations of "Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and provide a brief explanation of all the instances that you identify.

Domestication occurs when the translator uses non-conforming expressions that reduce foreign elements to receiving cultural values by:
  - Replacing culture-specific references with target culture equivalents
  - Adapting idioms, metaphors, or concepts to align with target culture norms
  - Eliminating or transforming foreign elements that might be unfamiliar to target readers
  - This makes the text more accessible to the target audience but can erase cultural distinctiveness and source culture nuances.

Task:
Identify only clear and deliberate instances of Domestication in the provided English translation. List each domesticated text segment separately in your response. You must take into account the historical, social-political and cultural contexts, which are outlined below.

Background on the Work:
"Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" (Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds) is a pioneering work by French author Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, published in 1686.
The book presents a series of elegant dialogues between a philosopher and a marquise during evening walks in a garden. Through these conversations, Fontenelle popularizes the Copernican heliocentric model and explores the revolutionary idea that other planets might harbor life.
What makes this work remarkable is how Fontenelle makes complex astronomical concepts accessible to non-scientific readers, particularly women who were often excluded from scientific discourse. It's considered one of the first major works of the scientific popularization genre, blending science with literary charm and philosophical speculation about extraterrestrial life.
The book was highly influential in spreading astronomical knowledge among educated Europeans and encouraging a more rational view of the universe during the early Enlightenment period.

Historical context:
In Britain, the reign between 1685 and 1689 of James II, a catholic monarch, caused increased tensions in a Protestant England. In 1687, James issued the Declaration of Indulgence (or Declaration for Liberty of Conscience) which granted religious tolerance to boast Catholic and Protestant dissenters such as Quakers and Puritans. This policy was deeply controversial since it bypassed parliamentary authority and was seen as an attempt to undermine the established Anglican Church. The supported religious tolerance caused alarm among Protestants, who feared a return to the dominance Roman Catholicism.

Social-political context:
The events that unfolded after King Charles II's death in 1685 made James' succession possible thanks to the alliance of the Catholics with the more conservative Tory-Anglican party related to a current of High Church movement (within the Anglican Church) that gave much importance to tradition, hierarchy and external forms of worship, being opposed by anti-Catholic "petitioners" and "abhorrers" under the name of Whigs.

Cultural context:
The late 17th century was the high point of the Scientific Revolution characterized by:
  1. The new Copernicus' heliocentrism envisioning the Earth moving around the Sun, like all the other planets, and the Moon orbiting around the Earth
  2. Increasing influence of the findings and thoughts of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton
  3. In 1687, just a year after the publication of Fontenelle's Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes, Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica provided ground-breaking hypotheses about gravity influencing the motion of all physical corps, from an apple falling from a tree up to all gigantic corps in the universe.
  4. These new ideas rose interest in Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, and scientific inquiry extended also to chronology of the world, in contrast with reacting religious authorities, who were responding trying to reinforce theological orthodoxy.
  5. The emerging of Enlightenment in western Europe is epitomized by Fontenelle's work. This cultural novel was one of the scientific writings in a vulgar language (French) while explicitly oriented to a female audience implicitly making science popular and approachable to every non-"savant" people.
  6. The picture of the universe as infinite in space and time prefiguring the whole world as independent from a continuous creator presence and negating the necessity of a Deus ex machina with a pre-established hierarchy of physical and animated beings. Free access of scientific and philosophical developments favoured by the expansion of printing press was opening the way to revolutionary shifts in the customs of the overall society where women and illiterate people in general started to be interested in new discoveries. The new ideas about science, governance, and the universe became increasingly intertwined.

Instructions:
  - Compare the source (French) and target_untagged (English) texts carefully.
  - Do not identify differences that arise purely from natural linguistic differences between English and French.
  - Only identify segments if the translator has actively adapted cultural elements to conform to target culture norms and values.
  - For each identified instance, provide:
    - The exact text segment from the source (French).
    - The corresponding text segment from the target_untagged (English).
    - An explanation of how the translation domesticates the original cultural elements.

Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.
You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object according to the format below, without any introduction, explanation, or conclusion text:

{
  "source_segments": [...],
  "target_segments": [...],
  "explanations": [...]
}

If no instances are found, you must only return:

{
  "source_segments": [],
  "target_segments": [],
  "explanations": []
}

Do not include any text outside the JSON object. Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else.

Je luy fis du moins promettre pour la conservation de mon honneur qu'elle me garderoit le secret, & quand je fus hors d'état de m'en pouvoir dédire, & que je voulus parler, je vis que je ne savois par où commencer mon discours; car avec une personne comme elle, qui ne savoit rien en matière de Physique, il faloit prendre les choses de bien loin, pour luy prouver que la Terre pouvoit être une Planète; & les Planètes autant de Terres, & toutes les Etoiles des mondes. J'en revenois toujours à luy dire qu'il auroit mieux valu s'entretenir de bagatelles, comme toutes personnes raisonnable auroient fait en notre place. A la fin cependant, pour luy donner une idée générale de la Philosophie, voicy le raisonnement dans lequel je me jettay.</P003>",

  "source": "<P072>Il ne seroit pas juste, reprit-elle, après que cet homme-là n'a pû se delivrer impunément de la, que les Habitans de cette Lune de Jupiter, dont nous parlions, en fussent quittes à meilleur marché. Nous ne leur ferons pas de quartier, ils subiront la Loy commune, & donneront dans quelque autre erreur, mais comme je ne me pique pas de la pouvoir deviner, éclaircissez-moy, je vous prie, une autre difficulté qui m'occupe depuis quelques moments. Si la Terre est si petite à l'égard de Jupiter, Jupiter nous voit-il? Je crains que nous ne luy soyons inconnus.</P072> <P073>De bonne foy, je croy que cela est, répondis-je. Il faudroit qu'il vît la Terre quatre-vingt-dix fois plus petite que nous ne le voyons. C'est trop peu, il ne la voit point. Voicy seulement ce que nous pouvons croire de meilleur pour nous. Il y aura dans Jupiter des Astronomes, qui aprés avoir bien pris de la peine à composer des Lunettes excellentes, aprés avoir choisy les plus belles Nuits pour observer, auront enfin découvert dans les Cieux une petite Planete qu'ils n'avoient jamais veüe. D'abord le Journal des Savants de ce Pays-là en parle; le Peuple de Jupiter, ou n'en entend point parler, ou n'en fait que rire. Les Philosophes dont cela détruit les opinions, forment le dessein de n'en rien croire, il n'y a que les Gens tres raisonnables qui en veulent bien douter. On observe encore, on revoit la petite Planete, on s'assure bien que ce n'est point une vision; on commence même à soupçonner qu'elle a un mouvement autour du Soleil; on trouve au bout de mille observations, que ce mouvement est d'une année; & enfin, grâce à toutes les peines que se donnent les Savats, on sait dans Jupiter que notre Terre est un Monde. Les Lurieux vont la voir au bout d'une Lunette, & la veüe à peine peut-elle encore l'attraper.</P073>",
  "target_untagged": "<P053>It is not just, said the Marquiese, that since that great Man was not free from the Fear of Eclipses for nothing, that the Inhabitants of that little Moon, shou'd come off at an easier rate: Let us give 'em no Quarter, but force 'em to submit to the common Law of Nature, and oblige 'em to yield to some other Folly. But since I will not trouble my self to guess at this time, what that may be, pray solve me one difficulty, which my Fancy has just now suggested; if the Earth be so little, in respect of Iupiter; does the Inhabitants of Iupiter see our Earth? I am afraid we are altogether unknown to 'em. Really, I believe it to be so, said I, for the Inhabitants of Iupiter must see the Earth ninety times less than Iupiter appears to us; which is too small to be perceiv'd by them; and all we can imagine for our advantage, is, to suppose that there are Astronomers in Iupiter, who after having taken a great deal of Pains, and fitting excellent Telescopes; and having chosen a very clear Night for making the Observation, they at last discover in the Heavens a little Planet, they had never seen before; and streight they set it down in the Philosophical Transactions of that Country. The rest of the Inhabitants of Iupiter, either never hear of it, or laugh at it if they do; the Philosophers themselves whose Opinion that discovery destroys, resolve not to believe it; and there are but some very rational People, that will trouble themselves with the thoughts of it. These Astronomers make new Observations; they again look upon this little Planet, and they begin to be assur'd that it is no Fancy but a real thing; then they begin to conclude, this little Planet has a Motion round the Sun; and after a thousand Observations, they at last find out that this Motion or Revolution, is performed in a Years time. So that, thanks to these learned Men, the Inhabitants of Iupiter know our Earth is a Planet and a World: The Curious are earnest to look on it through a Telescope; tho 'tis so little, 'tis hardly discoverable.</P053>"

    "The French source refers to 'Journal des Savants', a French scientific journal established in 1665, but the English translation replaces it with 'Philosophical Transactions', the journal of the Royal Society of England. This is a clear example of domestication where the translator substitutes a source culture reference with a target culture equivalent familiar to English readers."
