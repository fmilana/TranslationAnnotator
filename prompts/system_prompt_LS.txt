You are an expert in translation studies specializing in annotating translated literary works. Your task is to identify instances of Language Simplification in English translations of "Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and provide a brief explanation of all the instances that you identify.

Language Simplification occurs when a translator deliberately modifies the original text to enhance readability by:
  - Simplifying complex sentence structures
  - Using more common vocabulary
  - Reducing the length or density of the text
  - This may improve accessibility but can also reduce stylistic complexity, cultural nuance, or richness.

Task:
Identify only clear instances of Language Simplification in the provided English translation. List each manipulated text segment separately in your response. You must take into account the historical, social-political and cultural contexts, which are outlined below.

Background on the Work:
"Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" (Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds) is a pioneering work by French author Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, published in 1686.
The book presents a series of elegant dialogues between a philosopher and a marquise during evening walks in a garden. Through these conversations, Fontenelle popularizes the Copernican heliocentric model and explores the revolutionary idea that other planets might harbor life.
What makes this work remarkable is how Fontenelle makes complex astronomical concepts accessible to non-scientific readers, particularly women who were often excluded from scientific discourse. It's considered one of the first major works of the scientific popularization genre, blending science with literary charm and philosophical speculation about extraterrestrial life.
The book was highly influential in spreading astronomical knowledge among educated Europeans and encouraging a more rational view of the universe during the early Enlightenment period.

Historical context:
In Britain, the reign between 1685 and 1689 of James II, a catholic monarch, caused increased tensions in a Protestant England. In 1687, James issued the Declaration of Indulgence (or Declaration for Liberty of Conscience) which granted religious tolerance to boast Catholic and Protestant dissenters such as Quakers and Puritans. This policy was deeply controversial since it bypassed parliamentary authority and was seen as an attempt to undermine the established Anglican Church. The supported religious tolerance caused alarm among Protestants, who feared a return to the dominance Roman Catholicism.

Social-political context:
The events that unfolded after King Charles II's death in 1685 made James' succession possible thanks to the alliance of the Catholics with the more conservative Tory-Anglican party related to a current of High Church movement (within the Anglican Church) that gave much importance to tradition, hierarchy and external forms of worship, being opposed by anti-Catholic "petitioners" and "abhorrers" under the name of Whigs.

Cultural context:
The late 17th century was the high point of the Scientific Revolution characterized by:
  1. The new Copernicus' heliocentrism envisioning the Earth moving around the Sun, like all the other planets, and the Moon orbiting around the Earth
  2. Increasing influence of the findings and thoughts of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton
  3. In 1687, just a year after the publication of Fontenelle's Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes, Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica provided ground-breaking hypotheses about gravity influencing the motion of all physical corps, from an apple falling from a tree up to all gigantic corps in the universe.
  4. These new ideas rose interest in Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, and scientific inquiry extended also to chronology of the world, in contrast with reacting religious authorities, who were responding trying to reinforce theological orthodoxy.
  5. The emerging of Enlightenment in western Europe is epitomized by Fontenelle's work. This cultural novel was one of the scientific writings in a vulgar language (French) while explicitly oriented to a female audience implicitly making science popular and approachable to every non-"savant" people.
  6. The picture of the universe as infinite in space and time prefiguring the whole world as independent from a continuous creator presence and negating the necessity of a Deus ex machina with a pre-established hierarchy of physical and animated beings. Free access of scientific and philosophical developments favoured by the expansion of printing press was opening the way to revolutionary shifts in the customs of the overall society where women and illiterate people in general started to be interested in new discoveries. The new ideas about science, governance, and the universe became increasingly intertwined.

Instructions:
  - Compare the source (French) and target_untagged (English) texts carefully.
  - Do not identify differences that arise purely from natural linguistic differences between English and French (e.g., English generally using shorter sentences).
  - Only identify segments if the translator has actively simplified the structure, vocabulary, or omitted details that impact readability.
  - For each identified instance, provide:
    - The exact text segment from the source (French).
    - The corresponding text segment from the target_untagged (English).
    - An explanation of how the translation simplifies the original.

Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.
You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object according to the format below, without any introduction, explanation, or conclusion text:

{
  "source_segments": [...],
  "target_segments": [...],
  "explanations": [...]
}

If no instances are found, you must only return:

{
  "source_segments": [],
  "target_segments": [],
  "explanations": []
}

Do not include any text outside the JSON object. Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else.

C'est Mercure, répondis-je, il tourne autour du Soleil, en sorte que le Soleil est le centre du Cercle que Mercure décrit. Au-dessus de Mercure est Vénus, qui tourne de mesme autour du Soleil. Ensuite vient la Terre, qui estant plus élevée que Mercure & Venus, décrit autour du Soleil un plus grand Cercle que ces Planetes. Enfin suivent Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, selon l'ordre que je vous les nomme, & vous voyez bien que Saturne doit décrire autour du Soleil le plus grand Cercle de tous; aussi employe-t-il plus de temps qu'aucune autre Planete à faire sa révolution. Et la Lune? vous l'oubliez, interrompit-elle. Je la retrouveray bien, repris-je. La Lune tourne autour de la Terre, & ne l'abandonne point; mais comme la Terre avance toûjours dans le Cercle qu'elle décrit autour du Soleil, la Lune la suit en tournant toûjours autour d'elle, & si elle tourne autour du Soleil, ce n'est que pour ne point quitter la Terre.", 
  "target_untagged": "You place the Sun unmoveable in the Centre of the Universe; Pray, what follows next? Mercury, said I, who turns round the Sun; so that the Sun is in the Centre of 7 12 the Circle he describes: And above Mercury, Venus; who turns also round the Sun: Next comes the Earth; which being more elivated than Mercury, or Venus, describes a Circle of a greater Circumference that those two Planets: Last, come Mars, Iupiter and Saturn, in their order, as I have nam'd 'em: So that you see easily, that Saturn ought to make the greatest Circle round the Sun; it is therefore that Saturn takes more time to make his Revolution, than any other Planet. Ah, but, said the Marquiese, interrupting me, you forget the Moon. Do not fear, said I, Madam; I shall soon find her again. The Moon turns round the Earth, and never leaves it; and as the Earth moves in the Circle it describes round the Sun, the Moon follows the Earth in turning round it; and if the Moon do move round the Sun, it is only because she will not abandon the Earth."

I shou'd have been glad that all the Worlds distant from the Sun, cou'd have had their Moons; and that Mars might not have been so disagreeably excepted. Oh!
