You are an expert in translation studies specializing in annotating translated literary works. Your task is to identify instances of Added Text in English translations of "Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and provide a brief explanation of all the instances that you identify.

Added Text occurs when the translator includes propositions in the target text that are not present in the source text to normalize translations. These are elements that:
  - Appear in the target text but do not exist in the source text
  - Represent content added to provide clarity, context, or cultural relevance for the target audience
  - May include explanations, elaborations, or contextual details absent in the source but added to the target
  - Help normalize translations while maintaining coherence and naturalness in the target language

Task: 
Identify only clear instances of Added Text in the provided target text. Instead of inserting tags directly, list each added text segment separately in your response. Only include cases where the translator has deliberately added target text elements that don't exist in the source text.

Background on the Work:
"Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes" (Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds) is a pioneering work by French author Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, published in 1686.
The book presents a series of elegant dialogues between a philosopher and a marquise during evening walks in a garden. Through these conversations, Fontenelle popularizes the Copernican heliocentric model and explores the revolutionary idea that other planets might harbor life.
What makes this work remarkable is how Fontenelle makes complex astronomical concepts accessible to non-scientific readers, particularly women who were often excluded from scientific discourse. It's considered one of the first major works of the scientific popularization genre, blending science with literary charm and philosophical speculation about extraterrestrial life.
The book was highly influential in spreading astronomical knowledge among educated Europeans and encouraging a more rational view of the universe during the early Enlightenment period.

Historical context:
In Britain, the reign between 1685 and 1689 of James II, a catholic monarch, caused increased tensions in a Protestant England. In 1687, James issued the Declaration of Indulgence (or Declaration for Liberty of Conscience) which granted religious tolerance to boast Catholic and Protestant dissenters such as Quakers and Puritans. This policy was deeply controversial since it bypassed parliamentary authority and was seen as an attempt to undermine the established Anglican Church. The supported religious tolerance caused alarm among Protestants, who feared a return to the dominance Roman Catholicism.

Social-political context:
The events that unfolded after King Charles II's death in 1685 made James' succession possible thanks to the alliance of the Catholics with the more conservative Tory-Anglican party related to a current of High Church movement (within the Anglican Church) that gave much importance to tradition, hierarchy and external forms of worship, being opposed by anti-Catholic "petitioners" and "abhorrers" under the name of Whigs.

Cultural context:
The late 17th century was the high point of the Scientific Revolution characterized by:
  1. The new Copernicus' heliocentrism envisioning the Earth moving around the Sun, like all the other planets, and the Moon orbiting around the Earth
  2. Increasing influence of the findings and thoughts of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton
  3. In 1687, just a year after the publication of Fontenelle's Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes, Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica provided ground-breaking hypotheses about gravity influencing the motion of all physical corps, from an apple falling from a tree up to all gigantic corps in the universe.
  4. These new ideas rose interest in Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, and scientific inquiry extended also to chronology of the world, in contrast with reacting religious authorities, who were responding trying to reinforce theological orthodoxy.
  5. The emerging of Enlightenment in western Europe is epitomized by Fontenelle's work. This cultural novel was one of the scientific writings in a vulgar language (French) while explicitly oriented to a female audience implicitly making science popular and approachable to every non-"savant" people.
  6. The picture of the universe as infinite in space and time prefiguring the whole world as independent from a continuous creator presence and negating the necessity of a Deus ex machina with a pre-established hierarchy of physical and animated beings. Free access of scientific and philosophical developments favoured by the expansion of printing press was opening the way to revolutionary shifts in the customs of the overall society where women and illiterate people in general started to be interested in new discoveries. The new ideas about science, governance, and the universe became increasingly intertwined.

Instructions:
  - Compare the source text and target_untagged text carefully.
  - Do not identify differences that arise purely from natural linguistic differences between the source and target languages.
  - Only identify segments if the translator has deliberately added content to the target text that was not present in the source text.
  - For each identified instance, provide:
    - The exact text segment from the target_untagged text that was added and doesn't exist in the source.
    - The corresponding complete text segment from the source text where this added content would logically fit (but doesn't appear).
    - An explanation of why this target text element was likely added in the translation.
  - CRITICAL: DO NOT INSERT OR MODIFY TEXT IN THE SOURCE AND TARGET SEGMENTS, SUCH AS PARAGRAPH TAGS, [omitted], OR PARAPHRASES. THESE SEGMENTS WILL LATER BE MATCHED WITH THE ORIGINAL TEXT. IF YOU MODIFY TEXT IN THE SEGMENTS, THE DOWNSTREAM MATCHING TASK WILL FAIL.

Do not consider paragraph XML tags (e.g., <P001>); leave them untouched.
You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object according to the format below, without any introduction, explanation, or conclusion text:

{
  "source_segments": [...],
  "target_segments": [...],
  "explanations": [...]
}

If no instances are found, you must only return:

{
  "source_segments": [],
  "target_segments": [],
  "explanations": []
}

Do not include any text outside the JSON object. Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else.

S'il ne tenoit qu'à voler; que savons-nous, comme je vous disois hier, si on ne volera pas fort bien quelque jour? J'avoüe pourtant qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup d'apparence. Le grand éloignement de la Lune à la Terre serait encore une difficulté à surmonter, qui est assurement considerable, mais quand même elle ne s'y rencontreroit pas, quand même les deux Planetes seroient proches, il ne seroit pas possible de passer de l'Air de l'une dans l'air de l'autre. L'eau est l'air des Poissons, ils ne passent jamais dans l'Air des Oiseaux dans l'air des Poissons; ce n'est pas la distance qui les en empêche, c'est que chacun a pour prison l'air qu'il respire. Nous trouvons que le nôtre est mêlé de vapeurs plus épaisses & plus grossières que celuy de la Lune. A ce compte, un Habitan de la Lune qui seroit arrivé aux confins de notre Monde, se noyeroit dés qu'il entreroit dans notre Air, & nous le verrions tomber mort sur la Terre.</P042>",

I confess, Madam, there seems but little likelihood of what I say, since the great distance between the Moon and the Earth makes the difficulty so hard to overcome, which is very considerable; but tho' it were not, and that the Earth and the Moon were plac'd near one another, yet it wou'd not be possible to pass from the Air of the Earth, to the Air of the Moon. The Water is the Air and Element of Fish, who never pass into the Air and Element of Birds; 'tis not the distance that hinders 'em, but 'tis because every one of 'em are confin'd to the Air which they breath. We find that our Air is mix'd with Vapours, that are thicker and grosser than those of the Moon; and by consequence, any Inhabitants of the Moon, who shou'd arrive upon the Confines of our World, wou'd be drown'd and suffocated as soon as they enter'd into our Air, and we shou'd see 'em fall dead upon the Earth.</P032>"

Pour ses années elles ne sont que de huit mois, puis qu'elle tourne en ce temps-là autour du Soleil. Come elle est quarante fois plus petite que la Terre, la Terre de dedans Venus paroît une Planete quarante fois plus grande, que Venus ne nous paroît d'icy, & comme la Lune est aussi quarante fois petite que la Terre, elle paroît dedans Venus à peu prés de la même grandeur dont Venus nous paroît d'icy.</P055>",

As Venus is forty times less than the Earth, the Earth must necessarily appear to the Inhabitants of Venus, to be forty times bigger than Venus appears to us; and as the Moon is also forty times less than the Earth, by consequence, it must appear to the Inhabitants of Venus, about the same bigness that Venus appears to us.</P042>"
