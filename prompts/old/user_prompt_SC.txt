## Self-Censorship (SC) Task

Self-Censorship (SC) occurs when the translator omits ideological elements from the source text in the translation. These are elements that:
  - Appear in the source text but are deliberately omitted in the target text
  - Represent cultural, religious, political, or other ideologically sensitive content filtered out during translation
  - May include references, terminology, or concepts that are intentionally excluded from the target text
  - Result in the target text being ideologically sanitized compared to the source text

Task: Identify only clear instances of Self-Censorship (SC) in the provided translation. Instead of inserting tags directly, list each omitted text segment separately in your response. Only include cases where the translator has deliberately omitted source text elements in the target text.

Instructions:
  - Compare the source text and target_untagged text carefully.
  - Do not identify differences that arise purely from natural linguistic differences between the source and target languages.
  - Only identify segments if the translator has deliberately omitted content from the source text that should appear in the target text.
  - For each identified instance, provide:
    - The exact text segment from the source text that was omitted in the translation.
    - The corresponding complete text segment from the target_untagged text where this omitted content would logically fit (but doesn't appear).
    - An explanation of why this source text element was likely censored in the translation.

## Examples

Example 1:

Input:
{
  "source": "<P067>Je conçois, dit la <IIM>Marquise</IIM>, que ces pesanteurs-là reglent fort bien les rangs. Plût à Dieu qu'il y eût quelque chose de pareil qui les reglât parmi nous, & qui fixât les Gens dans les places qui leur sont naturellement convenables. Me voilà fort en repos du côté de Jupiter. Je suis bien aise qu'il nous laisse dans notre petit tourbillon avec notre Lune unique. Je suis bien-aise qu'il nous laisse dans notre petit Tourbillon avec notre Lune unique. Je suis d'humeur à me borner aisément, & je ne lui envie point les quatre qu'il a.</P067>",
  "target_untagged": "<P050>I understand very well, said the Marquiese, how these different Weights are regulated, according to their several degrees: Wou'd to God, there were some such Order amongst us Mortals, to confine every Man to the Station that is fit for him. I am now no longer in fear of Iupiter; I am satisfy'd that he will leave us at ease in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion; I am easily pleas'd, and do not envy Iupiter his four Moons.</P050>"
}

Output:
{
  "source_segments": [
    "avec notre Lune unique"
  ],
  "target_segments": [
    "in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion"
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The translator omitted the phrase 'avec notre Lune unique' (with our unique Moon) which should have appeared after 'in our own little Whirling, or Tourbillion'. This censorship removes the reference to Earth having only one moon, possibly to simplify the text or because the translator felt it was redundant given the mention of Jupiter's four moons later in the passage."
  ]
}

Example 2:

Input:
{
  "source": "<P074>Si ce n'êtoit, dit la <IIM>Marquise</IIM>, qu'il n'est point trop agreable de savoir qu'on ne nous peut découvrir de dedans Jupiter qu'avec des Lunettes d'approche, je me représenterois avec plaisir ces Lunettes de Jupiter dressées vers nous, comme les nôtres le sont vers luy, & cette curiosité mutuelle avec laquelle les Planetes s'entre-considèrent & demandent l'une de l'autre, Quel monde est-ce là? Quelles gens l'habitent?</P074>",
  "target_untagged": "<P054>If it were not, said the Marquiese, very disagreeable for me to believe, that our Earth is not to be perceiv'd by the Inhabitants of Iupiter, but by the help of a Telescope, I shou'd find an Infinite Pleasure in imagining, I shou'd see those Telescopes <SC></SC> pointing towards us; and ours from a mutual Curiosity are levell'd at them, whil'st those two Planets gravely considering one another, the Inhabitants of both ask at one and the same time, What World is that? What People are those?</P054>"
}

Output:
{
  "source_segments": [
    "de Jupiter"
  ],
  "target_segments": [
    "those Telescopes "
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The translator omitted the phrase 'de Jupiter' (of Jupiter) which should have appeared after 'those Telescopes'. This censorship removes the specific attribution of the telescopes to Jupiter, making the text more ambiguous about which planet's telescopes are being discussed, possibly to simplify the translation or to avoid repetition since Jupiter is mentioned earlier in the paragraph."
  ]
}

Now process the following input data:

{
  "source": "{SOURCE_FR}",
  "target_untagged": "{TARGET_EN_UNTAGGED}"
}
